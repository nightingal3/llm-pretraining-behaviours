"How AP reported in all formats from tornado-stricken regionsMarch 8, 2012
When the first serious bout of tornadoes of 2012 blew through middle America in the middle of the night, they touched down in places hours from any AP bureau. Our closest video journalist was Chicago-based Robert Ray, who dropped his plans to travel to Georgia for Super Tuesday, booked several flights to the cities closest to the strikes and headed for the airport. He’d decide once there which flight to take.
He never got on board a plane. Instead, he ended up driving toward Harrisburg, Ill., where initial reports suggested a town was destroyed. That decision turned out to be a lucky break for the AP. Twice.
Ray was among the first journalists to arrive and he confirmed those reports -- in all formats. He shot powerful video, put victims on the phone with AP Radio and played back sound to an editor who transcribed the interviews and put the material on text wires. He then walked around the devastation with the Central Regional Desk on the line, talking to victims with the phone held so close that editors could transcribe his interviews in real time.
Ray also made a dramatic image of a young girl who found a man’s prosthetic leg in the rubble, propped it up next to her destroyed home and spray-painted an impromptu sign: “Found leg. Seriously.”
The following day, he was back on the road and headed for Georgia and a Super Tuesday date with Newt Gingrich’s campaign. The drive would take him through a stretch of the South that forecasters expected would suffer another wave of tornadoes.
To prevent running into THAT storm, Ray used his iPhone to monitor Doppler radar, zooming in on extreme cells and using Google maps to direct himself to safe routes. And then the journalist took over again.
“When weather like that occurs, a reporter must seize the opportunity to get the news out and allow people to see, hear and read the power of nature so that they can take proper shelter,” Ray says.
So Ray now started to use his phone to follow the storms. He attached a small GoPro camera to his steering wheel in case a tornado dropped down in front of the car somewhere, and took video of heavy rain and hail with his iPhone. Soon, he spotted a tornado and the chase was on. He followed an unmarked emergency vehicle to Cleveland, Tenn., where he was first on the scene of the storm's aftermath.
Again, the tornadoes had struck in locations that were hours from the nearest AP bureau. Damage and debris, as well as a wickedly violent storm that made travel dangerous, slowed our efforts to get to the news. That wasn’t a problem in Tennessee, where our customers were well served by an all-formats report that included this text story.
“CLEVELAND, Tenn. (AP) _ Fierce wind, hail and rain lashed Tennessee for the second time in three days, and at least 15 people were hospitalized Friday in the Chattanooga area.”
The byline? Robert Ray.
For being adept with technology, chasing after news as it literally dropped from the sky and setting a standard for all-formats reporting that put the AP ahead on the most competitive news story of the day, Ray wins this week’s $300 Best of the States prize.

"Movie Review: 'Matru Ki Bijli Ka Mandola'
If only good intentions made a good film, Matru is a masterpiece. The story has warm, real characters, it arms the honest against the dishonest and although simplistic, it has much social relevance, especially in today's corrupt times. But even though the film has panjo, it seriously lacks punch.
Matru Ki Bijli Ka Mandola
Director: Vishal Bhardwaj
Cast: Pankaj Kapur, Shabana Azmi, Anushka Sharma, Imran Khan and Arya Babbar
O panjo, panjo, first things first. It is such a pleasure to see actors like Pankaj Kapur and Shabana Azmi back in the driver’s seat. With just their bearing, stance and such ease, the pair brings so much maturity and depth to their characters. It is a pity though that they have to be a part of such a half-baked plot.
Matru’s plot is a wisp floating in the breeze over the ripe wheat fields of the Mandola village in Haryana, unable to decide whether to be a mad slapstick, a social satire, a colonial farce or a modern comedy. And so it ends up just drifting - sometimes veering toward a sober Hariya Mandola, greedy industrialist in cahoots with grasping local minister-cum-longstanding ‘girlfriend’ (Shabana Azmi) wanting to sell off the farmers’ lands to transform his village into an industrial hub. And at times toward his drunk-as-a-skunk alter ego who understands the villagers’ plight and wants to give them their due.
At times, the plot drifts to his driver-cum-sobriety guardian Matru (Imran Khan) and his leftist leanings. Or then it moves toward Mandola’s over-smart daughter Bijli (Anushka), whose heart bleeds so much for a Zulu group of musicians her boyfriend has ‘bought’ for her entertainment all the way from South Africa, that she doesn’t mind slave-driving her local servants to get the Zulus settled comfortably. Politician mamma wants baron’s beti as bahu with a hefty land settlement as dowry. Mao-sympathiser driver wants to bust this deal. Baron’s beti doesn’t know what she wants.
Phew! To add to all the chaos is a pink buffalo with a ready grin. The film does have some genuinely funny moments but really, does Bhardwaj expect us to crack up at a chat between a drunk Mandola and a well? Or Mandola pulling the said well out of the way with a rope? Or say, villagers throwing cowdung at miscreants wanting to destroy their wheatfields or launching honeybees at the politician’s son? Those jokes went out of fashion with Johnny Walker.
Casting Anushka and Imran for this rustic political farce has been a daring move. Both of them look totally out of place. Anushka does her usual over-smart alpha-girl routine but falls a bit short in her emotional scenes with Kapur. Imran’s bushy beard manages to mask most of whatever acting he may have tried. As for Arya Babbar, who for once has a meaty fun role, completely botches it up with his enthusiastic hamming.
If only good intentions made a good film, Matru is a masterpiece. The story has warm, real characters, it arms the honest against the dishonest and although simplistic, it has much social relevance, especially in today’s corrupt times. But even though the film has panjo, it seriously lacks punch.",en,web

"PRE-ORDERS for Amazon's Kindle Fire tablet topped 95,000 on the first day the device was made available, according to analyst firm Edatasource.
This outstripped the orders for three other Kindle devices that Amazon launched last week, which totaled approximately 25,000 units during the same period.
Edatasource said it is able to gain insight into ecommerce sales through its panel of 800,000 inboxes. By analysing purchase receipts received by email, the firm is able to estimate the daily orders places at major ecommerce web sites as well as which products are being purchased.
In April 2010, Edatasource estimated the number of Ipad purchases to be 350,000 on the first day that product came to market. This compared to the 300,000 that Apple subsequently reported for first day sales.
The launch of the Kindle Fire, priced at $199, was announced on 28 September by Amazon and it made the device available for pre-order immediately on its web site. Amazon will begin shipments in November.
According to Edatasource, 27 per cent of Kindles were sold with some kind of accessory, and Marware protective covers were by far the most popular accessory for the Kindle Fire.
The 7in IPS ultra-wide display, dual-core processor tablet weighs 14.6oz. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said at the launch that Amazon will ship ""millions"" of the devices, which run a customised version of Android, from 15 November.
All of the content on the device is backed up in the cloud so users can delete things when they want. Content available will include 100,000 movies and TV shows, a million songs, apps from the Amazon Appstore and magazines.
Amazon launched the Fire tablet alongside three Kindles, two of which have a touchscreen. The WiFi only version is priced at $99 while the Kindle touch 3G costs $149 and has free 3G wireless. It's 75 per cent lighter than previous versions.
Amazon also launched a $79 Kindle that is not a touchscreen device and is 30 per cent lighter than the original Kindle at 5.98oz. It will cost £89 in the UK, and ships from 12 October. µ

"Nations Convention to Combat Desertification in Those Countries Experiencing
Serious Drought and/or Desertification, Particularly in Africa
|Treaties you might not expect|
This innovative Convention breaks new ground in international environmental law. Its objective is to combat desertification and mitigate the effects of drought in countries experiencing serious drought and/or desertification, particularly in Africa. It aims to do this through effective action at all levels, with the help of international cooperation and partnerships, in hopes of contributing to sustainable development in affected areas. Achieving this will involve long-term integrated strategies focusing simultaneously on
Countries that are party to the Convention, whether affected or developed, commit to a substantial series of obligations. In keeping with the Convention, these countries must adopt an integrated approach to addressing the physical, biological and socioeconomic aspects of desertification and drought. In addition, affected countries commit to prioritize combating desertification and mitigating drought's effects. They do this by creating strategies and priorities within a framework of sustainable development plans and policies. In turn, developed countries commit themselves to active support by providing substantial financial resources and other forms of assistance, individually or jointly, to the efforts of affected developing countries.
The Convention is to be put into effect through National Action Programs, which are the heart of the Convention, and supplemented by regional and sub-regional programs. When countries that are party to the Convention implement it, they should consider the participation of populations and local communities in a spirit of partnership and international cooperation.
The Conference of the Parties (COP) is established as the Convention's ruling body. The COP's main task is to make the necessary decisions to effectively carry out the terms of the Convention. The Convention also establishes a permanent administrative office that will arrange sessions of the Conference and its subsidiary bodies, and put together and transmit the reports it receives. A committee on science and technology will offer information and advice on scientific and technological issues.
The Convention spotlights Africa, and the first of the four Regional Implementation Annexes (an integral part of the Convention) is devoted to the continent. The other three annexes to the Convention (on Asia, the Northern Mediterranean, and Latin America and the Caribbean) lay out guidelines for putting the Convention into effect. All the Annexes specify that action programs will be part and parcel of their policies for sustainable development.",en,reference
"U.S. qualifies first two weight divisions for London Games
(Alexandria, Va.) and Diana Lopez
(Sugar Land, Texas) qualified their respective weight divisions for the 2012 Olympic Games by finishing third on Saturday at the Pan American Olympic Qualification Tournament in Queretaro, Mexico. A top-three finish was needed at the event to qualify.
Jennings, 25, and a bronze medalist at last month's Pan American Games, won his opening match of the day by a score of 10-5 over Victor Zepeda
of Honduras. He then moved on to the semifinal round with a 9-3 win over Ecuador's Sergio Dario Garcia Moreira.
In the semifinal round, Jennings quickly went ahead of Peru's Peter Lopez
by a 3-0 count only to see Lopez come storming back to win 5-4 and send Jennings into the do-or-die bronze-medal match against Jhohanny Bartermi
of the Dominican Republic. Jennings had lost to Bartermi in the semifinals of last month's Pan Am Games.
In the bronze-medal match, Jennings landed an early headshot on Bartermi to jump in front 3-1 after the opening round. He extended his lead to 6-2 through two rounds and stood his ground in the third period to claim a 7-2 win and qualify the U.S. a spot in the men's -68kg division at the London Olympic Games.
Lopez, 27, and a 2008 Olympic bronze medalist, began her day with a bang by point-gapping Bolivia's Mariana Escarlet Fuentes Tordoya, 13-0. In the quarterfinals she won an 8-2 decision over Guatemala's Euda Maria Carias Morales to reach the medal round. The semifinal match versus Cuba's Nidia Munoz Aleman went into a sudden-death overtime period and the Cuban was awarded the match after Lopez was issued a warning for inactivity, which was her second penalty of the round and gave Aleman the needed point for victory.
Faced with a must-win match for the bronze medal, Lopez played it even with Disnansi Polanco through two rounds and the score was deadlocked at 1-1 heading into the third period. Lopez attacked in the final round, going up 3-1 and holding on for a 3-2 victory to earn the U.S. a spot in the women's -57kg division at next summer's London Games.
Jennings and Lopez will now face a top U.S. challenger in March to determine the individual representative for the U.S. in their respective divisions at the 2012 Olympic Games in London. That challenger will come from an Olympic Trials in January among a pool of original Olympic Trials participants.
The U.S. has a chance to secure the final two weight divisions on Sunday when Steven Lopez
(Sugar Land, Texas) competes in the men's -80kg division and Paige McPherson
(Sturgis, S.D.) fights in the women's -67kg class. A top-three finish is needed to qualify each division. Lopez will need two wins in his bracket while McPherson will require just one victory to qualify.

EFTPS is a system offered by the U.S. Department of Treasury for paying federal taxes electronically via the internet, over the phone or through special channels designated for tax professionals, payroll services and financial institutions. You can use EFTPS to make all federal tax payments, including income, employment, estimated and excise taxes. Anyone can use it and it’s absolutely free.
You can make payments whenever it’s convenient for you, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Businesses can schedule payments up to 120 days in advance and individuals can set up payments up to 365 days in advance. Be aware that payments must be scheduled at least one calendar day prior to the date the taxes are due and the payment must be scheduled by 8:00pm ET.
You can schedule payments months in advance knowing that your instructions will be executed on the day you choose and your records will be updated with the IRS. As soon as the funds are transferred from your account to the Treasury’s account, you’ll immediately receive an acknowledgement that your payment has been made.
Before you can use the online system to make tax payments, you’ll need to enroll. To do so, you’ll need your tax identification number if you are making a business payment or your social security number if you are making a payment as an individual. You’ll also need a bank account number and the routing number. It takes about a week to receive your PIN in the mail.
Each online transaction requires authentication through both your PIN and password. Without both of these pieces of information, you will be unable to use most of the online EFTPS functions. As with all passwords, keep them in a safe place and don’t divulge this information to anyone.
Because the system retains sixteen months of your EFTPS online payment history, you can retrieve payments data with ease.
The bottom line is that the system is fast and you can make a payment in minutes. You can review all of the payment information for accuracy before sending the payment. It’s convenient because you can access the system from just about anywhere at any time. Lastly, provided you keep your login information private, the system is safe.",en,web
"This Breakfast Fruit Parfait was inspired by the one that had me babbling from pure joy at Another Broken Egg Cafe in Jackson, Miss.
Jeff could not get why I was having a religious experience over some yogurt, fruit and granola, but that parfait was swoon-worthy, from the artfully placed fruit on top to the “why didn’t I think of that?” strawberry yogurt in the middle.
It was prettier than it had to be. A tall glass full of inspiration.
Obviously, I needed to rip it off ASAP. And here we are!
I started by making my granola with things I already had in the pantry: oatmeal, coconut, brown sugar, sliced almonds, maple syrup and cinnamon. Combine those ingredients, add a few spoonfuls of vegetable oil, bake the mixture for about 15 minutes, and – bang! boom! voila! – granola.
(You can use packaged granola, but once you bake your first batch, you’ll never go back to paying $4 at the grocery. The insanity will make your butt twitch.)
As for the yogurt, any type will work – low-cal, low-fat, full-fat, Greek, fiber-filled, Jamie Lee Curtis-endorsed. Just be sure to choose two different flavors, preferably vanilla and your favorite fruit.
Why bother with two different yogurt flavors? Having the fruit yogurt in the middle gives the parfait an extra layer of flavor and prettiness without requiring any extra effort. On behalf of slackers everywhere, I’d like to say yesssssss.
Most breakfast parfaits are made with berries, so you could go with an all-berry parfait. I really liked the different colors and textures they used at Another Broken Egg, so I stuck with their fruit choices: banana, kiwi, strawberries and blueberries. I even sliced and arranged my fruit to recreate that nifty flower on top of my parfait.
But my imitation ended with the parfait glass.
I layered my granola, fruit and yogurt into a mason jar so that I could fasten a lid on top and hit the road.
Still swoon-worthy? Yesssssssssss.
And it was a nice reminder to make things a little better than they have to be.
From Rebecca Crump (Ezra Pound Cake)
Inspired by the Yogurt, Fruit & Granola at Another Broken Egg Cafe in Jackson, Miss.
Makes 4 parfaits
- 1 cup old-fashioned or quick-cooking oatmeal (for celiacs, look for certified pure oats)
- 1/2 cup sliced almonds
- 1/2 cup sweetened, shredded coconut
- 2 tablespoons dark brown sugar
- Pinch of salt
- Pinch of cinnamon (optional)
- 3 tablespoons vegetable oil
- 2 tablespoons maple syrup or honey
- 2 cups vanilla yogurt (any kind)
- 2 cups strawberry or other fruit-flavored yogurt (regular or gluten-free)
- 1 banana, sliced
- 2 kiwis, peeled and sliced
- 10 strawberries, sliced
- 1/2 cup blueberries
- For the Granola: Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. In a large bowl, mix the oatmeal, almonds, coconut, dark brown sugar, salt, and cinnamon (if using). In a small bowl, combine the oil and maple syrup. Add the liquid mixture to the oatmeal mixture, stir them together, and transfer to a baking sheet. Bake for about 15 minutes, stirring halfway for even color. Remove from the oven, and transfer to a large bowl to cool.
- To Assemble the Parfaits: Using four tall glasses or Mason jars, alternately layer the granola, yogurt and fruit three times. (Use fruit-flavored yogurt for your middle yogurt layer.)
Gluten-Free Tip: Use certified pure oats and a GF flavored yogurt.",en,web

"The Treasury Department rushed out a major revamp of its foreclosure-prevention program in 2010, limiting the plan's ability to help people who are unemployed or owe more than their homes are worth, a government watchdog says.
Treasury's Hardest Hit Fund, which distributes money to state housing agencies for a range of programs, has been plagued by delays and disagreements with mortgage companies that must participate for the program to succeed, according to a report released Thursday by the Special Inspector General for the financial bailouts.
""Treasury's failure to set meaningful goals for the program leaves the agency vulnerable to criticism that it's trying to avoid accountability,"" said Christy Romero, Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, in a statement.
The Hardest Hit Fund is part of the broader financial bailout known as the Troubled Asset Relief Program, a $700 billion bailout package approved at the peak of the 2008 financial crisis.
The fund was created to fix weaknesses in Treasury's earlier effort to prevent foreclosures. Critics had said the original program did not help unemployed people or people who owed more than their homes were worth.
Money from the Hardest Hit Fund is distributed to state housing agencies, which run a variety of aid programs for homeowners. The special inspector general's report says it has distributed only $217.4 million — about three percent of the money set aside for the fund.
Of the money that was distributed, nearly all went to assist people who were unemployed and late on their mortgages. Almost none went to people who are ""underwater"" because their homes lost value after they took out big loans.
Unless it is overhauled, the program is likely to have limited impact on those homeowners, the report says.
The program was hindered from the start by Treasury's failure to gain support from the government-controlled mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the report says. Many big, private mortgage companies initially refused to participate because they wanted guidance from Fannie and Freddie, it says. The companies, called mortgage servicers, collect people's monthly payments and foreclose when they fall behind.
""Without large servicers, the (state programs) could not reach a large portion of struggling homeowners,"" the report says.
In a letter responding to the report, Treasury's top official overseeing the bailout programs says the special inspector general's ""suggestions as to how the process might have been accelerated or improved are unworkable in practice.""
For example, Treasury says, special inspector general labeled as a ""delay"" the time it took for states to set up their programs by hiring housing counselors, creating online tools and hiring people to review applications.
The program ""is creating long-lasting foreclosure prevention capabilities,"" Treasury Assistant Secretary Timothy Massad says in the letter.
The letter notes that the program extends until 2017, so states have plenty of time to reach their targets for helping homeowners. It says Treasury worked hard to secure cooperation by Fannie, Freddie and the private mortgage companies, but does not have the authority to make them participate.

"Dishwasher reviews: FAQs
How much do I need to spend to get a good dishwasher?
Dishwashers costing less than £200 will be basic machines with no-frills. Some will do a good job of getting dishes clean and you’ll be able to fit as many items inside as with more expensive machines, but you’ll struggle find the kinds of feature that will make washing your dishes easier.
Dishwashing programs tend to run to set-times, rather than being sensor-driven. If the program works well, this won’t be a problem. But if it doesn’t, there are no sensors to add additional wash-time or to raise the water temperature to help get dishes really clean. Delay timers and digital displays showing the remaining wash-time are also rare on dishwashers for under £200.
The space inside a £200 dishwasher won’t be as flexible as that you’ll find on more expensive machines. You’ll be able to adjust the height of the upper dish rack to fit in larger items, but you won’t find quick-release clips to help do this quickly and easily. And many come from own-brands without a proven track-record for reliability. It’s rare at this end of the price-range to find machines good enough to be Best Buy dishwashers.
Dishwashers costing closer to £400 should have all of the features that cheaper models lack. Quick-release upper dish-racks, delay timers and childlocks are all common on dishwashers for around £400 and most will come with flood-prevention devices which stop the dishwasher flooding should the hose spring a leak. Space-saving trays for cutlery to lay flat in are more common at this price and £400 dishwashers should also be scoring top marks for energy and water use.
Many will come with sensor-control for at least some of their programs and digital displays are standard on dishwashers at this price. Lots of machines are good enough to be Best Buy dishwashers for around £400.
If you pay more than £500 for a dishwasher you should be looking for something a little special. They should be weighed down with of all the features you need to make dishwashing easy, they’ll be the best dishwashers for energy and water-use but look for a touch of innovation as well. There are dishwashers at this end of the price range which use heat-retaining minerals to help reduce energy during the drying phase and others that only use seven litres of water to wash a full-load of dishes.
Do different programs use different amounts of water and electricity?
We’ve tested dishwashers on their main program, which washes dishes at the hottest temperatures, and their eco or energy-save program, which uses less water and electricity but washes for longer and at lower temperatures.
Because Eco programs like this wash dishes at lower temperatures, they usually need a little bit longer to get the dishes clean.
The good news is there isn’t a huge amount of difference between washing results on the main program and the eco program with our Best Buys, but the eco program will use significantly less water and electricity than the main program.
Intensive programs are designed to clean extremely dirty pots, pans and dishes that would normally need soaking, rinsing and extra wash cycles to get them sparkling and clean.
Intensive results are generally impressive but come at a price – intensive programs use more energy and water than either the main or the eco programs.
How does a dishwasher compare to washing by hand?
Washing by hand can be a quick and easy way to clean your dishes. But it won’t always save water when compared with using a dishwasher.
The eco program on one of our Which? Best Buys uses just 12.1 litres of water to wash a full load of 97 items – that’s just a little bit more than a standard washing up bowl.
And by using the intensive program for your really dirty pots and pans you won’t have to soak them first, which again will save some water.
If you don’t leave the tap running while you wash, are happy to use one bowl of water for everything and don’t rinse or soak anything, you might save water by washing by hand. But it will be a very close run thing.
Is it better to use all-in-one tablets or separates?
Three-in-one tablets supposedly provide all the consumables a dishwasher needs – detergent, rinse aid (to prevent watermarks) and dishwasher salt (to soften hard water) – in one handy tablet. Many dishwashers now feature a special program for these.
Four-in-one and five-in-one products claim to have an additional function to keep glasses looking newer for longer (four-in-one), as well as a function to give a better shine to stainless steel (five-in-one).
Before using all-in-one tablets, check your dishwasher manual. If you have an older machine that doesn't have a three-in-one button and isn't designed to work with all-in-one products, you may invalidate your warranty.
With all-in-one products you'll usually still have to add dishwasher salt separately. See our to help you choose the best one for you.
Do you have any dishwashing tips?
- Place the largest items at the side and the back of the machine – they might prevent water from reaching the detergent dispenser if they're at the front.
- Pre-rinsing by hand is a waste of time and water. Wipe food residues away and/or use the rinse-and-hold program.
- For the best cleaning, make sure the dirtiest side of the dish faces towards the centre of the dishwasher.
How do I wash delicate glasses?
Cleaning delicate glassware in the dishwasher can be a problem. Most manufacturers suggest you avoid putting long-stemmed wine glasses in, as they may break.
The aluminium, lead and silver content of crystal glasses also tends to discolour or fade if you wash them repeatedly.
If you're feeling brave and want to risk glassware in the dishwasher, there are a few things to bear in mind:
- Wash delicate glassware separately and select the lowest temperature with the shortest duration possible.
- Spread glasses out in the upper basket to ensure they avoid contact with each other. Some wine specialist stores such as wineware.co.uk and manufacturers including Whirlpool sell crystal glass racks for this purpose.
- Use a mild that is ‘kind to dishes’ or labelled ‘glass protector’.
- Place a cup of white vinegar in the lowest part of the dishwasher and run for 10 minutes. Stop the cycle, add a little detergent and re-start
- To prevent damage, remove glasses from the machine as soon as the program has finished.
What's the best way to get rid of my old dishwasher?
You can get rid of an unwanted dishwasher through the retailer supplying your new model or via your local council. Check when you buy if a retailer will take away an old machine when delivering a replacement.
Your local authority has a responsibility to offer a collection service for the disposal of waste machines, but it's a bit of a postcode lottery. Some councils offer free collection; others charge up to £30.
If you can take the machine to your local civic amenity yourself, though, there should be no charge. For more information on recycling electrical products and the Weee Directive see our recycling guide.
One thing to remember is that it doesn't have to be sent to a landfill site. Large household appliances already make up 43% of the total electrical and electronic waste sent to landfill – and there are other options.

Are small worktop dishwashers any good?
Many people with small kitchens won't have room for a plumbed-in dishwasher, so a worktop or tabletop dishwasher might seem like a good idea. They take between four and six place settings (compared with eight to 10 for a slim model or 12 for a full-sized one).
However, most models we've tested didn't produce impressive cleaning results and were quite noisy.",en,web

"Tuesday, January 22 at 4:00 PM ET
For this week's football blog, I am again stealing a page from our weekly football podcasts and ripping off the weekly GameChanger article featuring our Live ScoreCaster feature (free for every NFL playoff game) to review some interesting notes from the two conference championship games. The weekend also saw our picks go 1-0-1 ATS with a win on Baltimore +9.5 and a push with San Francisco -4. This keeps our record in conference championship games and Super Bowls unblemished (8-0-1 ATS) and secures a third consecutive non-losing NFL playoffs since the site launched.
Super Bowl Content
Super Bowl content on the site will begin with the straight-up, against-the-spread and over/under picks available at 8 pm ET on Wednesday, January 23. This will not include a boxscore or any written analysis, but these picks will be free to all (though Play Analyzer access to view pick information at modified lines will only be available to subscribers). On Monday, January 28 at 8 pm ET, the additional props projections, boxscore and an in-depth analysis (plus any updates to the original pick that are necessary due to injury or other roster information) will become available to subscribers to the Playoff Picks and Super Bowl Props packages. Super Bowl picks on PredictionMachine.com are 3-0 ATS all-time, while my personal record in published Super Bowls is 8-0 ATS. (Hint: While that eight game stretch has seen me identify Super Bowl value in five underdogs and three favorites, unless something drastic happens in the next 28 hours, we will like the favorite to win and cover in New Orleans on February 3. That is certainly notable now as most of the action has come in on the underdog and we are just one of three of CBS Sports nine experts that are even picking the favorite to win).

San Francisco @ Atlanta
Game Changer: Like we have said many times before, fumble recovery is essentially a random event in the NFL. Two fumbles occurred within three minutes of each other in the NFC Championship game Sunday. Here is a look at how each swung the projected win percentages for the recovering team.
With 1:00 left in the 3rd quarter, the Falcons are leading the 49ers 24-21 when Matt Ryan bobbles a snap that is recovered by Aldon Smith of the 49ers. Prior to the fumble, Atlanta’s win percentage is 64.6%, with a projected score of 31-28. When the Falcons lose the ball, their win percentage drops to 48.1%, with a projected score of 28-27 49ers.
Seven plays after Matt Ryan’s fumble, with 13:24 left in the 4th quarter, Michael Crabtree tries to extend his body to get into the end zone only to have the ball stripped away by the Falcons. Prior to the fumble, the 49ers win percentage was 65.6%. After the turnover on the Falcons' one-yard line, San Francisco’s win percentage drops to 46.8% with a final projected score of 27-26 Atlanta. Luckily for the 49ers, their defense forced a three-and-out and on the next series Frank Gore rushed for the game winning score.
Additional Notes: While I would not necessarily recommend doing it for a regular season NBA game, I have thoroughly enjoyed turning on all notifications in the free Live ScoreCaster app, including the Projected Lead Chang notification. Of all of the games that we have projected in-game with Live ScoreCaster, this was the most entertaining. The projected lead fluctuated back-and-forth throughout the third and fourth quarter of the NFC Championship game. While what we saw on the field was certainly quite the rollercoaster ride for those of us on San Francisco -4, seeing the 49ers have a strong chance to win the game after just about every play was uplifting (despite even having a 17-0 lead in the second quarter, Atlanta was never more than 78.5% likely to win). Over the course of the game, there were 28 plays while San Francisco was losing in which we still projected the 49ers to win the game outright.
One of the more notable, unheralded plays of the game occurred with 12:00 to go in the fourth quarter when Ted Ginn returned a 48 yard Matt Bosher punt 20 yards to the Atlanta 38 yard line. Previous to that return, San Francisco was just 44% likely to win the game. With such great field position, the 49ers became the favorites (59% likely to win) and never looked back. Even though San Francisco did not score for five more plays, the 49ers spent the final 30 plays of the game as our projected winners.
As it relates to covering the spread (or in this case, pushing versus losing ATS), one of the more important plays of the game may have occurred when San Francisco had a 3rd-and-15 from its own five yard line with one minute left. Frank Gore picked up ten yards on the play and the 49ers let the clock run down to 13 seconds remaining before punting the ball away. Had Gore been stuffed, Andy Lee would have been punting the ball from deep out of his own end zone (like feet butting up against the back line of the end zone deep). An intentional safety would have certainly been in play in that situation. Taking the safety could have taken a couple of seconds off the clock, shifted the score to 28-26 and allowed Lee to get off a free kick rather than potentially have his punt blocked in the end zone. With little opportunity for Atlanta (and an obviously hurt Matt Ryan) to receive/return the free kick, travel into field goal range and kick a field goal in essentially ten seconds, Jim Harbaugh may have preferred that route to the dangers of punting out of the back of the end zone. Fortunately, Frank Gore picked up enough yards to keep Lee out of the end zone entirely and render that logic invalid (though I'm sure Harbaugh told Lee that if had any problems with the snap whatsoever to just grab the ball and run through the back of the end zone)... These are things that run through the minds of those who are just as concerned with margin of victory as who wins.
One other lasting thought from this game is the 49ers' reliance on the pistol offense. It's become sports talk fodder to discuss the relevance and shelf life of the formation - especially in the context of formations like the ""wildcat"" that essentially thrived in the NFL for one weekend in 2008. First of all, discussing the potential shelf life of such a formation to me is akin to questioning whether teams will continue running out of shotgun or in single back formations, because that's exactly what the pistol offense is - a hybrid of the traditional under-center single back formation (though other pro-style formations with lead blockers can be run from it as well) and shotgun in which the quarterback is closer to the center than in typical shotgun formation and the running back is essentially as deep behind the line of scrimmage as he usually is. I don't know if that answers the question of whether or not the pistol is ""here to stay,"" but it certainly is not a very radical concept.
That being said, Colin Kaepernick is not getting enough credit for what we have seen from the 49ers in the pistol formation this season. Yes, he is a physical specimen with the arm strength to make just about every throw on the field, the speed to outrun most defenders on the edges and the size to withstand hits. For all of that, we as football fans are appropriately in awe. However, Colin Kaepernick was already the greatest pistol quarterback of all-time when he entered the league. Playing under pistol innovator, Chris Ault (again, not that innovative, but Ault has honed and stuck with the formation since returning to his alma mater in 2004), Kaepernick was a four-year starting quarterback at Nevada. In college, he took roughly 3,500 snaps during live game action in the pistol formation and accounted for on 14,210 yards on 1,871 passes and runs from the pistol over 51 games. Not only is Kaepernick as close to the most perfect physical athlete as one could be to run the pistol formation, he is its most experienced and knowledgeable signal caller ever. He's probably teaching Jim Harbaugh and offensive coordinator Greg Roman just as much about the offense as they are teaching him. Put that behind the best offensive line in the league, with the most athletic playmaking set of tight ends and add in weapons like Frank Gore, Michael Crabtree and LaMichael James and it should not be surprising to see Kaepernick and the 49ers' offense succeeding. Sure, Baltimore, especially with an extra week to prepare, may find a way to contain the 49ers, but this pistol offense actually presents one way in which Kaepernick has more experience than his defensive counterparts like Ray Lewis.

Baltimore @ New England
Game Changer: The Patriots played a conservative game; some would suggest they played not to lose. Here is one example of conservative play calling that could have changed the outcome for New England.
With 6:25 left in the first quarter, the Patriots opt to kick a 31-yard field on 4th-and-2 instead of being aggressive and going for it. There isn’t a large sample size of the Patriots going for it on 4th-and-2 but, over the last three years, the Patriots have converted 42 of their 65 attempts (64.6%) on 3rd-and-2 (Shout out to Bill Barnwell for this awesome stat). By converting the field goal attempt the Patriots win percentage becomes 72%, with a projected final score of 27-18. Had the Patriots attempted to convert the 4th down and been successful; their win percentage jumps to 79% with a projected final score of 33-21. Converting the 4th down would have been worth an extra 7% in win likelihood and three additional points in projected margin.
Also, with 6:49 left in the 4th quarter, the Patriots are trailing the Ravens 28-13. After a quick 36-yard pass and catch from Tom Brady to Wes Welker, the Patriots have the ball 1st-and-10 from the Baltimore 24-yard line. Tom Brady’s next pass gets tipped at the line, but instead of harmlessly falling to the ground, it rockets 30 yards into the air, which gives Dannell Ellerbe enough time to make the interception. After the interception the Ravens win percentage jumps to 99.9% with a projected final score of 31-16 (under the total line of 51). If the pass is not picked, the Patriots have it 2nd-and-10, the Ravens are still projected to win 97.9% of the time, but the projected score becomes 31-21, a cover on the over of 51.
Additional Notes: While the NFC Championship is noteworthy (to me at least) for its back-and-forth nature and projected lead changes, the AFC Championship between Baltimore and New England is notable for the exact opposite reason. There was just one projected lead change the entire game. The play that ultimately shifted the projections in Baltimore's favor (for good) occurred with 3:30 left in the third quarter. The Ravens were up 14-13 at the time and had a 2nd-and-14 from their own 33 yard line. At the time, they were 47% likely to win the game (they were playing a superior opponent, only up one point, in their own territory and facing a second-and-long). On the next play, Torrey Smith caught a 23 yard pass from Joe Flacco to give Baltimore a first down and put them in New England territory. At that point, the Ravens were 57% likely to win. About four minutes of game time later, Baltimore scored a touchdown to go up 21-13 and become 80% favorites to win the game, which they ultimately did after tacking on another touchdown.
Having seen the Patriots five times in the last four years, Baltimore was as prepared as any team (with a realistic chance of winning) could be to face New England and its pace. While that certainly gave the Ravens an edge defensively that most teams lack, the Patriots ultimately suffered greatly from injury losses to play-making, matchup nightmare tight end Rob Gronkowski (his health issues also plagued their Super Bowl chances last season) and cornerback Aqib Talib (who exited late in the first quarter when the Patriots were blanking Baltimore 3-0). While I am definitely not disappointed in a Baltimore win (and cover as a 9.5 point underdog), the Ravens did not dominate this game the way that most NFL teams that win by more than two touchdowns should. But in a rare turn of events, Baltimore let New England beat itself and the Patriots obliged.

"Founded in 1941 by aviation pioneer Thor Solberg, Solberg Airport is a small general aviation airport located in central New Jersey. Since its founding, the airport has played an integral role in New Jersey aviation as well as a vital link in the United States transportation system. Over the past 65+ years, it has helped thousands of people realize their dream of flying an airplane as well as providing a home for hundreds of airplanes and airships.
Situated on 725 wide open acres in Readington Township, NJ, the airport provides a serene backdrop for everything from a family picnic to any one of the many events held at the airport annually. Readington township and the surrounding communities have been able to benefit immensely from the annual Easter bunny and Santa Claus fly-in events, as well as the New Jersey Festival of Ballooning, which is held every summer. In its 65 plus years of operation, the airport has provided much needed jobs and tax revenue.
In the spirit of its founder, the Solberg Airport is currently run by two generations of his heirs. His children: Thor Solberg Jr., Lorraine Solberg and Suzy Solberg Nagle maintain day to day operations with the help of their four children. It is a true family business and community airport. If Readington Township is successful in condemning the airport land, the annual events, the airships, and even the airplanes themselves will no longer be able to operate.
In 1985, Thor Solberg Sr. was inducted into the New Jersey hall of fame and it is the hope of the Solberg family and airport supporters that his legacy will live on at Solberg Airport.",en,unknown

"Tips to reach 100 by creating your own Blue Zone
If you’ve ever wondered what people who live to be 100 have in common, science may have some answers. When you read stories about groups of people living fit and healthy beyond a hundred years, you can’t help but wonder, what are they doing? Now, science is unlocking clues that may help us understand the mysteries behind longevity. New research is centered on areas called Blue Zones, geographical areas in the world where many residents consistently live to be 100 or more. Sardinia, Italy is one such area where many centenarians can be found. So is it just good luck that people to live to be 100? Here are some starting points to consider in your own journey to long life.
Is this Shangri-La? The chances of finding long living, healthy adults in the world’s Blue Zones are 20 times greater than in other places. They also have lower rates of cancer, heart disease and dementia. It turns out where people live the longest on earth, they share something in common. Their secret to a long life is no secret at all. Residents in Blue Zone communities have a consistent regimen of good eating, interests and activities, constant learning, daily exercise, and social interaction.
I want to live in a Blue Zone! Here are a few simple steps you and your family can take to improve the chances of living a long life. The key ingredient for maximizing your success is consistency. That means everyday you need to be active and eat a healthy diet—not just on weekdays. The only element you can’t change is your genetics. Since we can’t ask for do-over in this category, let’s move on to things we can control and help improve our chances of living to 100.
Follow these steps toward creating a Blue Zone in your house:
All centenarians in the Blue Zones of the world are active participants in the world around them. The phrase “use it or lose it” can be life changing and life saving, particularly when it comes to exercise. The key is to find an activity that you enjoy such as running, biking or swimming and you’ll be much more likely to incorporate it into a regular activity.
Maintain social networks
Avoid being isolated. Keep a circle of close, good friends. The Australia Longitudinal Study on Aging, a study that has followed nearly 1,500 people over 70 years old for 10 years, says friends may be more important than you think. The study found that social networks like strong friendships can prolong your life. If you have good friends who you share inner secrets with, and you chat with them often, this close-knit interaction impacts you in a healthy way.
Mom Was Right, Eat Your Veggies
Many communities identified within the Blue Zones have a mostly plant-based diet. They eat veggies every day, many times a day. In Japan, fish is the main meat consumed at home. Omega fatty acids are good for the brain and body, and fish and legumes have all the nutrients you need to put you on your path to become a centenarian. Eating the right foods can also help to combat the adverse affects of oxidation and damage of brain cells.
East Less, Eat Right
There is a concept in Okinawa that is the opposite of ‘supersizing’ the meal. They are known for a practice called, Hara hachi bu (???, which translates roughly to “80% belly”. Eat just a little bit less than whatever full is for you. You will get the nutrients you need while lowering your caloric intake. Moderation here may keep your metabolism in top shape.
Learn to relax
It’s also important to try to relax more often and allow the toxic effects of stress to dissipate. Blue Zone communities share an understanding of the importance for rest and relaxation. Centenarians have found effective ways to de-stress and keep their minds active. Start building a Blue Zone in your house today. If you live right, eat right, exercise, laugh often and continue the joys of learning, you’re on your way to reaping the rewards of a richly filled, long life.

"Banks To Start Adding Debit Card Fees; Bank of America and More
Starting soon, maybe as soon as tomorrow, if you’re like me and use your debit card to buy everything from gum to groceries to video games, you may have to pay a monthly fee for the convenience of not carrying cash everywhere.
Albeit not much, five dollars, that’s five more dollars that we never used to have to spend just to put our money in a bank. I first heard about Bank of America doing this yesterday, but now I’m learning that other banks like Chase and Wells Fargo may be doing it as well. Not that I’m surprised. A lot of national chain banks are starting to have fees for just about everything else you do.
Here’s what the New York Times said on this:
Bank of America joins banks including SunTrust and Regions in charging the fees. Other institutions, like Wells Fargo and Chase, are testing them, too. And over all, bank fees have crept up to record levels, a recent survey found.
The added fees have come even though the limit on the merchant fees wasn’t as low as banks initially had feared. (The Federal Reserve originally considered a cap of 12 cents, or half of what it finally set.)
Looks like I may be back to carrying cash on me once again. How about you? Tell us what you think in the comments below.

ACLS ineffective in SQL-Ledger and LedgerSMB
Apr 06 2007 06:48AM
Chris Travers (chris metatrontech com)
I have decided to finally send to this list a serious security flaw in
the design of SQL-Ledger (all versions). LedgerSMB (all versions) is
also affected but the problem (with a workaround) has been mentioned in
our documentation since the fork. Ordinarily I would not make a big
deal out of this (since we are already clear about why we suggest using
db accounts for security), but I feel that DWS is misrepresenting the
security of SQL-Ledger and I think people need to be aware of the risk.
The access control lists associated with users in SQL-Ledger and
LedgerSMB do nothing more than enable or disable menu items. They do
not, however, actually prevent access to the application in any
meaningful way. The reason is that none of the application's functions
actually check the access control lists before executing. For this
reason, anyone can access any other part of the application simply by
typing the required URL in the address bar (to get a valid url, try
right-clicking on the data-entry frame and select ""Show only this frame""
Again, my big issue isn't that this is broken in SQL-Ledger but that the
author seems content to let people not know that it is broken and that
there are ways to properly secure it. The access control feature is
As for a workaround, we have always suggested that this feature is
inadequate for security purposes and that roles need to be isolated into
separate database accounts (which the application does support).
However, this process is cumbersome. The LedgerSMB project intends to
automate this process properly in 1.3.0 (perhaps six months away).

"Insurance Company Declares Living Man Dead
George Johannesen is very much alive. Which is why it was so surprising when the Canadian man received a letter addressed “To the Estate of George Johannesen.” Even more surprising is that it came from his insurance company, who should really be on top of such things.
Now this wouldn’t have been so terrible if Manitoba Public Insurance was giving Johannesen’s estate a fat check for his passing away. But that’s not what happened. Instead the letter was to inform the estate that, since George was dead, his driver license and auto insurance had been cancelled in October.
This poses a problem for Johannesen because, being alive, he continues to drive his car.
“I don’t understand how this could have happened,” he told the Toronto Sun. “For me to be declared dead, someone would have to present a death certificate. For someone to get that, I guess I must have died sometime in October.”
Now the 59-year-old worries that he will stop getting his pension and other government benefits. The Manitoba Public Insurance Company says they are trying to resolve the issue. They also claim they weren’t the ones who determined Johannesen was dead, but cryptically can’t reveal the source of the confusion for confidentially reasons.

"MYRTLE BEACH, SC.-
Faces and Stories: A Portrait of Southern Writers will be on display at the Myrtle Beach Art Museum
September 5, 2009, through January 3, 2010.
Initially commissioned to photograph the founding members of the Fellowship of Southern Writers, internationally acclaimed photographer Curt Richter expanded the project over a seven-year period to photograph over 200 writers associated with the South. Sixty of these photographs appear in Faces and Stores: A Portrait of Southern Writers, an exhibition of black and white portraits paying tribute to the strong literary heritage of the American South.
Richters work has been highly acclaimed by visual art collectors as well as the authors themselves. According to author Robert Coles, Richter evokes the inevitable mystery of talent, if not genius. Ann Beattie, one of the Southern authors featured in Faces and Stories, comments, [Richter] waits for the expressive moment that has little or nothing to do with the face people usually present to the world. Coles and Beattie agree that the power of Richters Faces and Stories inspires the audience to see aspects of themselves in the photograph while acknowledging the subtle strength of each authors portrait.
Curt Richters photography has been exhibited internationally and appears in museum collections worldwide. He is winner of the John Kobal Portrait Award, a Guggenheim Fellowship and a Fulbright Grant. His images have been published in Conde Nast Traveler, Esquire, Fortune, House and Garden, Mirabella, The New York Times Magazine and Rolling Stone. Born in New York, Richter now live is Finland.
Art Museum Executive Director Pat Goodwin is delighted this exhibit will be at the Museum. For all of us who love the visual arts and the written word with some regional tenure this is the perfect exhibit. Curt Richters photographs are so engaging dramatic yet very personal and straightforward. They make you want to linger and to learn more about the subject and his or her works.",en,reference

"According to reports, Mr Jammeh recently told supporters he would “cut off the head” of any homosexual caught in the Gambia.
1. The Gambia is ruled by President Yahya Jammeh, an army officer who seized power in 1994.
In the past, he has also claimed he could cure anyone with the Aids virus in three days.
2. A British couple who have spent the past 12 years working as Christian missionaries in the the Gambia have been jailed after being charged with sedition. (British missionaries jailed in Gambia )

3. Scary Tales of Tiny Gambia Being the Headquarters of the Mafia World
By Bubacarr Ceesay
December 13, 2005
The Gambia is the international limelight again as the center of an international mafia ring.
In a masterpiece investigative report, The Wayne Madsen Report unraveled a network of weapons smugglers and mobsters operating in the heart of the Gambian Capital, working hand in hand with the Gambian leader, President Yahya Jammeh.
In reference to the Gambia, the report stated thus:
""There is also now interest in the activities of Richard T. Hines, the head of the powerful Republican lobbying firm RTH Consulting, Inc.
""Hines, a South Carolina native and a protege of the late GOP dirty trickmeister Lee Atwater, was one of the architects of the dirty tricks campaign by Bush against John McCain in the 2000 South Carolina primary.
""A confederate of Abramoff in the 1980s Reagan administration's covert support network for the Nicaraguan contras, Angolan UNITA guerrillas, and Afghan mujaheddin, Hines is active in various Confederacy resurgence organizations, many of which have clear racist agendas.
""However, that has not prevented Hines from becoming the lobbyist for Gambian dictator Yahya Jammeh, a military officer who overthrew Gambia's democratically-elected President Sir Dawda K. Jawara in a 1994 military coup supported by the United States Navy.
""Hines inherited the lobbying contract for Gambia from the eclectic Washington lobbyist Edward von Kloberg III, an individual who represented Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire, Liberia's Samuel K. Doe, Nicolae Ceausescu of Romania, Congolese leader Laurent Kabila, the exiled King Kigeli V of Rwanda, and Saddam Hussein.
""Last May, von Kloberg took a swan dive off of a castle in Rome, allegedly committing suicide after a spat with a gay partner.
""The connections between Hines and Gambia are important since the small narrow West African country is also a major base of operations for notorious Russian international arms smuggler Viktor Bout.
""The Gambia is the headquarters for one of many of Bout's front companies -- companies that are used to smuggle everything from weapons to diamonds and mercenaries to international relief supplies.
Bout, reportedly in a Bangkok jail since March 2008
""In fact, Bout was the character on whom fictional arms smuggler Yuri Orlov, played by Nicolas Cage in the movie Lord of War, was largely based.
""Bout's connections with the Christian Right do not end with Gambia.
""Bout was Liberian dictator Charles Taylor's primary arms and diamond smuggler.
""Bout and his associates were given Liberian diplomatic passports and, with Taylor's blessing and protection, they registered a number of their front companies in Monrovia, the Liberian capital.
""Taylor, who is now in exile in Nigeria, was a business partner with Christian Coalition founder Pat Robertson.
""Robertson's organization mentored both Ralph Reed and Richard Hines.
""According to British and Israeli intelligence sources, Taylor also enabled Al Qaeda to launder blood diamonds for cash through Liberia.
""Liberia and neighboring Sierra Leone were where Israeli mobsters engaged in business with Israeli gangsters who operated under the full protection of the Israeli Likud government.
""Before Likud began purging Mossad of experienced intelligence officers with ties to the Israeli Labor Party, the Israeli-Al Qaeda diamond financial connection in West Africa was being pointed out by those officers as suicidal for Israeli interests.
""However, Taylor and Bout had powerful interests in the United States: a combination of the Christian Right and pro-Likud organizations like the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), both of which ignored and continue to ignore Israeli organized crime connections to Al Qaeda and terrorism.
""Robertson and Taylor were business partners in a Cayman Islands front company called Freedom Gold, Ltd.
""In fact, Freedom Gold bas headquartered at Robertson's CBN offices in Virginia Beach, Virginia. Robertson's African interests also crossed paths with Bout's in another country -- the former Zaire.
""Robertson's African Development Company used the cover of Robertson's tax-exempt ""Operation Blessing"" to ferry conflict diamonds out of civil war-ravaged Zaire (now Congo).
""A UN Security Council report dated November 30, 2005, lists Bout's Gambia New Millennium Air Company as having its address at the residence of Hines' client Jammeh: State House, Banjul, Gambia.
""The UN report states, 'The Director of this firm is Baba Jobe, who is already listed on the Liberia Sanctions Committee's assets freeze list. According to a commercial aviation database, the firm acted as a cover for Victor Bout's operations. Its one aircraft, a Russian-made passenger jet, was acquired from Centrafrican Airlines.'
""It is noteworthy that Hines's client, President Jammeh, just took possession of the Russian-made VIP presidential passenger jet, an Ilyushin IL-62 (C5-GNM) [Gambia] (formerly CCCP-86511 [USSR], RA-86511 [Russia], 3D-RTI [Swaziland], TL-ACL [Central African Republic]).
""And also of interest is the owner of the presidential aircraft: it is none other than Gambia New Millennium Air, the Bout-owned company listed on the UN Security Council freeze list and which is headquartered at Jammeh's State House in Banjul, the Gambian capital.
""In fact, the plane had been previously registered to Bout front companies in Swaziland and the Central African Republic.
"" Bout, who flew arms and passengers from Dubai and other locations to Taliban-controlled Afghanistan prior to 9-11, is now providing air services in post-Taliban Afghanistan as well as U.S.-occupied Iraq.
""Bout's transactions with the Taliban were handled by Vial, Inc., a firm based in Delaware.
""One of Bout's closest associates is the Russian-Israeli Odessa-born crime boss Leonid Minin, an Israeli national who, according to the UN Security Council, travels on forged German passports as well as legal Israeli, Russian, Greek, and Bolivian passports under at least ten aliases.
""It is also noteworthy that many of Bout's operations are based in Eastern European countries that have been mentioned in association with the rendition and transporting of CIA prisoners.
""Bout's numerous Russian-built cargo and passenger planes have been seen at the same airports used by CIA flights.
""For example, Bright Aviation, a suspected Bout front, is based at Sofia Airport in Bulgaria.
""Bulgaria is believed to be one of the countries used by the CIA to house secret prisoners.
""Another Bout front, Moldtransavia SRL, is based in Chisinau, Moldova, another suspected stopover point for CIA flights.
""One Chisinau, Moldova-based Bout front company, Aerocom, which also does business as Air Mero, is contracted to fly for Kellogg, Brown & Root in Iraq and elsewhere.
""Aerocom has also been cited in UN and DEA reports for being involved in drug smuggling in Belize.
""Some law enforcement officials in the United States and Europe believe that the covert flights being operated by CIA contractors and Bout's companies in support of secret prisoner movement are also involved in smuggling drugs.
""After being subjected to news reports, Aerocom quickly changed its name last year.""
Highly dependable sources in Banjul also informed AllGambian about recent arms purchase by the Jammeh regime from an undisclosed country, amounting to 4.3 million dalasis.
This comes at the heels of a hard-hitting border impasse between the Gambia and Senegal.
The stand-off almost paralyzed the Gambian economy and caused untold hardship on the average Gambian. Observers wondered how the Gambia gov can afford to spend on presidential jets and military hardware at this junction when the economy is in shambles.",en,web
"The best of healthy living
My cousin Albert was a dedicated worker; in short, he is a workaholic type of man. His line of job is quite good and perfectly suited to his knowledge as a talented cook. And because he is working in a busy and fast paced environment, he became a regular customer of “social vices” every time he’s off from work. To ease or to relax his tired body from a day of grueling task, he indulges to smoking cigarette and drinking liquor until he gets drunk. His kind of lifestyle was repeated all year round. He is not concerned at all about the way he run his life, what he think is that, he is enjoying his life with his vices.
After so many years of addiction to vices, his body started to show signs of symptom like diseases. His body has had enough, and in June of this year, he succumbs to kidney malfunction and his respiratory tract was likewise affected in which a tube like device was inserted in his throat for him to breathe properly. My cousin was lucky enough to survive after months of hospital confinement. Thus, he has completely recovered and is now back in his usual self sans the vices that almost killed him in the process.
The message of the story is clear: vices can kill. When someone consumes too much cigarette and drink liquor to the max, expect no other place to go but hospital, or worse, instant death. Our health depends on what we do in our lives. As the Italian film may suggest, “Life is Beautiful.” The early you reject or discard vices the better. Or, better still, do not try to use vices and stay away from it for good. Having a healthy lifestyle is a moral responsibility for it set an example to others. So, if you’re into vices leave it now, change for the better and have a healthy living.

"First Successful Uterus Transplant
Find a Conversation
|Fri, 09-21-2012 - 12:48pm|
Doctors in Sweden have successfully transplanted a uterus from a mother to her daughter: http://abcnews.go.com/Health/Wellness/uterus-transplant-latest-fertility-feat/story?id=17261824#.UFyYU7JlSp4
Although this surgery has advantages in allowing a woman to carry her own child, there are disadvantages. From the article referenced above:
Disadvantages include surgery for the uterus donor and recipient, and a lifetime of anti-rejection drugs. It's also unclear whether the transplanted uterus will be receptive to embryos. But if it is, the procedure would mean any woman of any age could get pregnant – in theory, anyway.
""Today, the one woman who can't get pregnant is the woman with no functioning ovary and no uterus. But if this technique works, that woman could get pregnant with a transplanted uterus and egg donation,"" Goldfarb said.
Of course the surgery is raising a lot of ethical questions, which tends to happen whenever new breakthroughs are made in fertility. What do you think about this breakthrouh? Do you think it will become a realistic option for women in the future?",en,web
"What Is Cardiac Arrest?
What is cardiac arrest? People die from cardiac arrest every day all around the world, but most people don't actually know what happens during cardiac arrest. Cardiac arrest kills approximately 95 percent of its victims even when they receive help quickly. Most people believe that cardiac arrest strikes without warning, leaving victims helpless to prevent it. Sometimes cardiac arrest does strike out of the blue, without warning signs, but the majority of the time there are signs and symptoms that go ignored or misunderstood, causing people to miss the opportunity to save their own life.
A heart attack and cardiac arrest are two different things. A heart attack takes place when portions of the heart muscle are deprived of blood flow and oxygen, which causes damage to the heart muscle. Sudden cardiac arrest is actually a complete loss of heart function, which leads to loss of consciousness, breathing and pulse. Frequently, sudden cardiac arrest is caused by disturbances in the heart's delicate electrical system. That is the reason why victims of sudden cardiac arrest are frequently shocked with a defibrillator in order to get their hearts functioning once again.
There are two cardiac rhythm disturbances that can lead to cardiac arrest which respond favorably to electrical shocks from a defibrillator. They are ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation. Ventricular tachycardia is a rapid heart beat that originates in the heart's ventricles. Ventricular tachycardia originates in the ventricles and consists of a heart rate of more than 100 beats per minute with at least three irregular heart beats in a row. Ventricular tachycardia can have many causes, including an enlarged heart, heart attack, myocarditis, scar tissue or low potassium levels in the blood. Ventricular fibrillation is generally caused by an electrical disturbance, and it originates in the ventricles as well. Ventricular fibrillation causes the heart's ventricles to flutter, creating an inability for the heart to pump blood effectively. Both ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation respond to electrical shocks from a defibrillator and can often be converted back to a normal rhythm. Both of these electrical disturbances within the heart can lead to sudden cardiac arrest.
Have you ever wondered why you see automatic external defibrillators, or AEDs, on the walls anywhere that large numbers of people congregate? It's because early intervention with a defibrillator can save the life of victims of cardiac arrest by restoring a normal heart rhythm. Victims of cardiac arrest often have had signs and symptoms that something is awry, or they have a known heart condition. Individuals suffering from lightheadedness, sudden fatigue, shortness of breath or fainting should be seen by a medical professional immediately. Sometimes you will only get one warning that something is wrong; if you ignore that warning, you have missed an opportunity to potentially save your life. Middle-aged men in particular are known for ""cardiac denial,"" which is where signs and symptoms of a cardiac problem are ignored or dismissed, leading to a heart attack or sudden cardiac arrest. Medical advances have made many cardiac problems highly treatable using medication or surgical intervention. Patients suffering rhythm disturbances can have a cardiac pacemaker implanted which will automatically send an electrical impulse to the heart muscle in the event there is an arrhythmia, thereby avoiding cardiac arrest.
Cardiac arrest is always a loss of heart function, whereas a heart attack is a disruption of blood flow to portions of the heart muscle. Heart attacks are generally caused by a physical blockage of a coronary artery. Cardiac arrest is often brought on by a disruption of the heart's electrical system, causing it to cease functioning altogether.",en,reference
"For nearly a year GamePolitics has been tracking ATCA, the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA).
As we have reported, ACTA deals in large part with copyright issues and is being negotiated in secret by the U.S., Japan, Canada, the EU and other nations. Details of ACTA are largely a mystery to consumers despite the fact that dozens of corporate lobbyists have been clued in to parts of the treaty, including Stevan Mitchell, VP of IP Policy for game publishers trade group the Entertainment Software Association.
Sadly, consumer interests suffered a major blow last week as the Electronic Frontier Foundation and Public Knowledge dropped a federal lawsuit seeking to cast a little sunshine on the ACTA negotiations. The EFF explained that a recent decision by the Obama Administration to claim a national security exemption for the ACTA talks made the lawsuit unwinnable; federal judges have little leeway to overrule such claims. The move by the Obama White House extends a similar policy put in place by the Bush Administration.
Public Knowledge Deputy Legal Director Sherwin Siy commented on the decision:
Even though we have reluctantly dropped this lawsuit, we will continue to press the U.S. Trade Representative and the Obama Administration on the ACTA issues. The issues are too far-reaching and too important to allow this important agreement to be negotiated behind closed doors.
The worry, of course, is that the United States will emerge from ACTA with a done deal that favors Big IP in the fashion of the consumer-unfriendly DMCA. Hal Halpin, president of the Entertainment Consumers Association, expressed concerns about ACTA earlier this year:
Because ECA supports the balance that must exist between the rights of copyright owners and the right of copyrighted material consumers, we do not think it wise to include any portions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) in the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) currently being discussed...
We are concerned that any DMCA language in ACTA may cause enormous, unforeseen negative implications in US law...
GP: As GamePolitics mentioned above, video game publishers lobbying group the ESA is privy to at least a portion of the secret ACTA negotiations while its industry's customers - video game consumers - are barred from knowing anything at all.
That makes us wonder - will the Video Game Voters Network, which is owned and operated by the ESA, commence a letter-writing campaign on behalf of its gamer-members demanding that the White House pull the curtain back on ACTA?
Somehow we doubt it.
FULL DISCLOSURE DEPT: The Entertainment Consumers Association is the parent company of GamePolitics.

"HUGHESVILLE - Jet City Vega will perform at 10 p.m. Saturday at Big Dogz Sports Bar, 5010 Route 220.
The Harrisburg-based rock band formed two years ago - influenced by bands such as Led Zeppelin, Van Halen and KISS - and has been motivated to spread its music to audiences across the country.
The band has gone by two other names before settling on Jet City Vega. Originally, the band was called Silver Screen Prom Queen, but Obie O'Brien, who has worked with Bon Jovi and Alice Cooper and was helping the band with their EP, told them the name was too much of a tongue twister and suggested they change their name to Manian, despite the protest of the band's singer, Manian Van Hacker.
The band soon discovered there was a European techno DJ who already was going by the name Manian, and the band found themselves in need of yet another name change.
Van Hacker said the band's name started with his profound love for David Bowie and is a play off of the song ""Suffragette City.""
""I had Jet City and another band member came up with Vega and we thought about the three words for a day and we realized how cool that sounded ... Jets are fast-paced, city is just kind of a broad term and we play a lot of big cities and Vega is one of the brightest stars. We want to be the brightest, the loudest and have a big impact,"" Van Hacker said.
Jet City Vega is Van Hacker, vocals; Brandon Reece, guitar; Tim White, bass; and Keith Collins, drums. All members hail from Harrisburg, except for Collins, who is from Frackville.
Van Hacker described the bands' sound as ""full-on assault rock 'n' roll, but with a nice pretty little bow wrapped around it.""
He said they like to get down and dirty and groove, but they also like to make it sweet. All of the members have different backgrounds and musical tastes, which makes for an interesting mix.
They have toured the mid-Atlantic area and the west coast and performed in the South by Southwest SXSW Annual Music and Film Interactive Conference and Festival in Austin, Texas.
The band also played Rockapalooza in Michigan and Cleveland, has received regular radio airplay and has shared the stage with the likes of Bon Jovi, Three Doors Down, Shinedown, Fuel, Candlebox, Warrant and many others.
""The best think I like about performing live is the audience,"" Van Hacker said. ""If you're doing your thing and you're doing it right, the audience will respond. That can be just as great as having sex. We look for that there and that fix. None of us are drug addicts, so this is like our drug. We love a great audience who gets into it and has fun. It becomes a great marriage of enjoying life and music and that's what it's all about.""
Jet City Vega's self-titled EP came out late June and features three songs, which were recorded in Nashville and Philadelphia. Van Hacker said it is like their calling card and they have plans to record a full-length album after the new year.
Van Hacker said he loves being a part of a band and the comradery among himself and his bandmates.
""We are a bunch of goofballs,"" he said. ""Traveling is just full-on humor. We are more like brothers than co-workers in a sense. We fight like brothers and get along like brothers - like family.""
He also said another great thing about being in a band is the creativity and collaboration that goes into creating music and motivating each other before shows.
When he's not on the road, Van Hacker said he likes to spend as much time with his wife as possible. And maybe equally as much time on the couch watching historical and biographical music documentaries on Netflix.
He said the band is working on building a tour since the release of the EP and aims to bring their music to the masses.

"Today we learned that Chelsea Clinton, seen at right, will be the latest celebrity to walk down the aisle with a Jewish partner — her longtime boyfriend Marc Mezvinsky. And thus, the most powerful liberal political dynasty in the country has firmly allied itself with the Chosen People.
It’s unclear whether, like Ivanka Trump did earlier this year, the Methodist-raised Clinton will convert before tying the knot — and perhaps signing a ketubah. Chances are she won’t convert, but we do know that she was reportedly spotted with Mezvinsky attending Yom Kippur services at Manhattan’s Jewish Theological Seminary.
Like sex symbol Jon Hamm’s devotion to his Jewish partner Jennifer Westfeldt did, a non-Jewish celebrity choosing a Jewish partner causes flutterings of pride in some, and anxiety about intermarriage among others. But in this case, it’s also symbol to many of how far we’ve come. As Sylvia Barack Fishman wrote when discussing, on the pages of the Forward, Ivanka Trump’s marriage to real estate scion Jared Kushner:
Marrying a Jew — even becoming a Jew, as Ivanka has done — no longer means removing oneself from high society. On the contrary, becoming a Jew may mean joining one of contemporary American society’s most enticing cultural streams.
It’s true. Jewish political figures like Rahm Emanuel and David Axelrod surround President Obama — and even the Roosevelts have a Jewish great grandson, a rabbi no less. So the idea of a Clinton marrying into a Jewish family doesn’t seem so far-fetched. After all, her father raised himself up out of poverty to climb political ranks, but could never quite shake his image as an interloper — a slick, ambitious Southerner who didn’t fit in with the Capitol’s elite.
In that particular aspect, and the vitriolic savageness with which they have been attacked (although they are often their own worst enemies) the Clintons have a distinct familiarity to them — even, I daresay, a hint of Jewishness, given their insider-outsider status. And Mezvinsky’s parents, both former politicians who have seen their share of scandal, appear to have plenty in common with their future machatunim.
In other words, it looks like a good match. So let nine months of speculation over chupah selection, glass-breaking and officiants commence. And to Chelsea Clinton, mazel tov!",en,web
"1. The White Star Line was the company that built the Titanic, and was owned by J.P. Morgan, an American tycoon. It cost $7.5 million to build the Titanic. It was the most luxurious ocean liner of its time. The price of a first class ticket cost each passenger $4,700 which was a HUGE amount of money for the time. It would be about $57,000 today.
2. As the Titanic was leaving the port, the suction it caused actually snapped the ropes of a nearby docked ship, the S.S. New York. Tugboats had to race to the scene to prevent the New York from colliding with the Titanic. Some people felt this was a bad omen.
3. There were six iceberg warnings received by Titanic on the day of the collision. They were all ignored by the wireless operator. Unfortunately, that operator was preoccupied with transmitting passenger messages. The night the collision occurred was moonless and the water was still. Both of these facts made it very difficult to see into the dark night and black ocean. The iceberg that the Titanic struck was not very big. It did not even come up as high as the bridge of the ship.
4. The Titanic was traveling 22.5 knots. This was just .5 knot from her maximum speed capability. The ship was clearly traveling too fast for conditions. The collision occurred at 11:40 P.M. on Sunday, April 14, 1912.
5. The captain ordered the engines reversed which sealed the Titanic's fate. A ship as large as the Titanic turned more quickly the greater her forward motion. Had the Titanic proceeded ahead and turned, it is most likely that she would have avoided hitting the iceberg all together. The gash that the iceberg cut into the hull of the Titanic was between 220 to 245 feet long. The total length of the ship was approximately 882 feet. Recent evidence shows that an opening the size of a refrigerator is what allowed water to enter the ship. Also, the ""watertight"" compartments of the Titanic's hull were not actually watertight. They were open at the tops, which made the disaster worse. The ship could have stayed afloat if only four compartments flooded, but five actually flooded.
6. A total of 1,503 people died, including passengers and crew. Only 705 people survived. Only 1 child from first class died, while 49 children from steerage died. Many dogs were also aboard the Titanic. Two survived. Charles Joughin was the only person to survive the ice cold Atlantic water.
7. Law required a ship the size of the Titanic to have 962 lifeboat seats. The Titanic had 1,178 seats, but 2,208 lifeboat seats were needed to get everyone off the ship. Many of the lifeboats left the ship only half full. There were 472 lifeboat seats not used. Not many people went down with the ship. Most of the people went into the Atlantic Ocean with life jackets on. However, the water temperature was only 31 degrees, so most people froze to death in the water.
8. The Carpathian was the ship that responded to the Titanic's distress call, but she was 58 miles and 4 hours away.
9. Orders from the Captain were that, women and children were to board the lifeboats first. One man, Daniel Buckley, disguised himself as a woman to get aboard a lifeboat. The band played music up to the last few minutes before the ship went under. None of the band members survived.
10. The Titanic lies 12,600 feet at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. The two pieces of the Titanic lay 1,970 feet apart from one another on the ocean floor. The Titanic was rediscovered on July 14th, 1986, seventy-four years after it sank. Since the death of Millvina Dean, May 31, 2009, there are no longer any living survivors of the Titanic tragedy. Millvina Dean was just nine weeks old at the time of theTitanic's sinking.
On April 10, 1912 the R.M.S. Titanic set out from Southampton, England on her maiden voyage across the North Atlantic. The Titanic was the shining jewel of the White Star Line, and she was thought to be unsinkable.

"I want to write a story about my history with Coca-Cola–something for a health/wellness hippy magazine. How does someone get to the point where they consumer six to ten cokes a day without even thinking twice about it… for over two decades? I’ve tried on and off to “cut down” but it wasn’t until I decided to quit the habit entirely that I started having some success.
In the name of full disclosure: Somedays, I will have a Coke Zero. However, I’m quitting that too.
I now drink a lot of tea. My favorite is this one: Sweet Leaf Tea Lemon & Lime Unsweet. Available at Whole Foods, made in Austin.
This story has drama, comedy, romance, horror, and a triumph of the human spirit (orchestral score by John Williams). Hippy magazine editors, be ready for me.
A new month and a new short story. I wrote this one with a deep respect for Oxford American magazine and a fondness for small Texas towns. I might submit it to OA for publication, if they don’t mind that a few of you read it “via email” first. Thank you to all my subscribers for your patronage. Not a member? For only $10, you too can join the fun. Here’s a preview of this month’s story:
“Escaping Venus Texas” by David Hopkins
Eileen always thought the rats would eat the cockroaches—or that the presence of cockroaches would indicate an absence of rats. Imagine her displeasure when both proliferated and partnered together. During the year she lived with Chad, the cockroaches appeared on the walls, the floor and the ceiling. Eileen used Glamour with Reese Witherspoon on the cover. The Happy Issue. She rolled the magazine into a baton. An optimistic headline faced outward: “301 things to put you in a good mood fast.” 1… 2… 3… she crushed three cockroaches that evening. But it was the appearance of the rat that made her decide to leave Chad.
The rat was in the kitchen. The rat did not scurry when it saw Eileen. It was not afraid of Eileen. This bothered her.
“Go!” She waved her arms above her head. “Get out of here!”
The rat turned toward Eileen and sniffed the air. The gesture said, “Make me.” Read more →
Since going over the cliff as a full-time freelance writer, I haven’t had as much time to devote to comics. If Quick still existed, I would definitely continue WE’VE NEVER MET (read the saga on my published works page, scroll down). However, beyond that, I’ve needed to focus my work on words without pictures. That doesn’t mean I’m not still thinking longingly about comics. I just have to be a little more patient and strategic about the comic book projects I take on. Here’s one: Brent Schoonover and I put together a story called PETITION TO THE GODS.
Brent included a sneak peek on his beautifully re-designed website. Take a look: http://brentschoonover.com/work/petition-to-the-gods/ It’s about as dark a story as you’re ever going to read. You might not imagine it coming from me since I can’t stomach most horror films. Who knew I had it in me?
If you’re a publisher and you’re reading this, and you’re not a wimp, you should publish PETITION TO THE GODS. Hey there. Wink. http://brentschoonover.com/work/petition-to-the-gods/
This story takes place in Venus, Texas. The September short story (coming soon) also takes place in Venus. It might be my favorite small town.

“Lolito” by David Hopkins
Lolito, bane of my existence, pain in my ass. My sin, my suffering. Lo-lee-toe: the tip of the spine shudders taking a trip of three vertebrae downward to tap, at three. Lo. Lee. Toe.
He was Toe, plain Toe, at the live art show, standing five feet ten in combat boots. He was Toto in his oversized Kevin-Smith jean shorts. He was Lee at school. He was Lorenzo on the dotted line. But at my booth, at every damn comic book convention, he was always Lolito.
As Vladimir Nabokov once wrote, “You can always count on a murderer for a fancy prose style.”
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, exhibit number one is what all geeks and nerds, the misinformed, simple and noble, envied: I had my own booth to sell my comics. I had a base of operations.
He invaded that base on a continual basis. Read more →

“The Lucky Buck Poetry Club” by David Hopkins
Don was not disappointed; he was devastated. The roof of their bar, the Lucky Buck, caved in by the weight of last night’s snow. Don sat in his pickup truck, staring at the wreckage. The snow on the roof, which melted and re-froze into a heavier block of ice, exploited a weakness in the tired structure, broke through and everything gave way. The hole was massive. More snow drifted in.
Don kept his truck running, and stepped outside. The cold left him breathless. He gasped and zipped his coat to his chin. Don took a step towards the bar and then slipped on a patch of the icy sidewalk. The salt did little to melt anything. Don regained his balance and made it to the door. It was locked. There was a note posted inside the small window: BAR CLOSED. CAN YOU GUESS WHY? No doubt written by Sally who arrived earlier that morning. Don rested his head against the entrance. He could hear the creaking of the Pabst Blue Ribbon sign above him. Read more →
D Magazine has another issue available. (Amazing how that happens every month…) This one includes my story The Good Fortune of Bad Kids Go to Hell:
How two Dallas boys moved to Los Angeles and made a movie the hard way. If not for the story itself, you must check it out because of the amazing photo by Elizabeth Lavin. I love it.
Next to the Angelika in Mockingbird Station, a secret side door leads to a nightclub used for special events. A red carpet unrolled at its doorstep in March after the new horror comedy Bad Kids Go to Hell had a private screening. Inside, the room pulsed with music, but no one danced—save for one guy. He was all over the place. A few girls in tight dresses swayed to the beat, which was all their attire would allow. The DJ performed his task in an animated fashion to disguise the simplicity of his job. Everyone else shifted through the dark room, moving from one conversation cluster to another on a seven-minute rotation. Speaking over the noise, they talked politely about the movie they had just seen. “I think it’s going to be a huge hit. I really do.” “I just loved it.”
At the entrance, filmmakers Matthew Spradlin and Barry Wernick stood on the red carpet, framed by a Bad Kids backdrop. It was their movie and their night. Both had their arms around a star from the film while the cameras flashed. (One actor had been in Degrassi and White Oleander; the other was a pretty girl who had played bit parts in a smattering of lesser-known films.) Spradlin and Wernick each wore a mischievous smile—as if they had planned everything to go precisely this way.

“If You Could Be” by David Hopkins
Angela and I dated five years ago. I can’t remember who stopped calling. Probably me. Fantasy Football and my post-college career demanded more time than I would ever admit. Commuting left me useless at the end of the day, and the responsibility of a career created this counter balancing force of sloth. I had enough energy to watch Sportscenter and drift through the Internet on my laptop. That was it. Discarded pizza boxes, DVDs, fast food wrappers, and unopened junk mail spiraled across my living room, originating from my couch like the Fibonacci sequence. Yeah, I flaked on dates.
In time, I acclimated to my job. I cleaned my apartment. I learned to cook meals for one. I sold my futon and bought real furniture. Life became a manageable process, not as daunting as people had always warned. If Angela and I had started dating in the summer, it would have been different. Read more →
The May issue of D Magazine is now available online. It includes my story about CitySquare’s LAW Center (click here, read, and enjoy).
Charles Johnson has a knack for finding students in need. During his 15 years as a security worker at North Dallas High School, he has taken in 39 teenagers who had nowhere else to go. He allows them to stay at his Oak Cliff home, where he lives with his mother. He’s a man of simple means who believes in helping others. One morning, he found one of his most recent tenants.
Ariel came to the United States from Honduras. He joined his sister and her 2-year-old daughter. His sister was deported after stealing food to feed them. Scared and alone, Ariel started looking for help. When Johnson saw him, he could tell he was hungry and in trouble. Ariel barely spoke English, but he tried his best to explain the situation. He had come here to escape a drug gang that had killed two family members. The gang shot up their house and was looking for him. Ariel was going to be sent back, which meant certain death.
Johnson doesn’t make much money. What little he earns goes to cover the cost of caring for his students. He didn’t know how he could afford an attorney. Johnson first went to a large law firm. They were sympathetic but couldn’t immediately take the case. To keep Ariel in the country, a family court first needed to award Johnson conservatorship, which required written permission from the parents in Honduras. But Johnson couldn’t find them, and the order needed to be issued before Ariel turned 18, only days away.

Ever so often, someone is brave enough to ask for my opinion on something they’ve written. I’m a curmudgeony (yes, that a word) Creative Writing teacher — and not the cute kind of curmudgeon either. My mind is trained to not like what you’ve written. Not out of spite, but just because there is so much crap out there. Something magnificent, by definition, must be rare. If someone hands me a script, I will always try to read it. Usually, I don’t finish. That, in itself, should be taken as a sign.

"Question: How is bipolar disorder different from unipolar depression or 'regular' depression?
Answer: Both bipolar disorder and major depression are typically associated with depressive episodes. So both illnesses are accompanied by depressions. The difference is that in bipolar disorder people also have periods of elevation -- or severe irritability. We call these manic or hypomanic episodes.",en,reference
"Jersey's new Durrell gorilla Badongo 'settling in well'
A new silverback gorilla has arrived safely in Jersey from France.
Badongo arrived at Durrell wildlife park on Tuesday evening from La Vallee des Singes, just south of Poitiers in France, where he was born.
He will be in quarantine for six months but visitors to the park will be able to see him in the indoor gorilla exhibit.
Durrell says all being well Badongo will be mixed with the female gorillas in about two weeks.
A member of staff at Durrell said: ""He is settling in really well, is calm and content and we are in the midst of the first stage of his introduction.""
He replaces Ya Kwanza, who had been at Durrell for 18 years and left the island last week because he had not bred for eight years.
Ya Kwanza was sent to join a bachelor group of gorillas at La Vallee des Singes.
The Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust has been famous for its gorillas since 1986 when Jambo stood guard over a young boy who had fallen into his enclosure.",en,web

European police warned Monday that the integrity of football was at stake, as they revealed they had smashed a criminal network fixing hundreds of matches, including in the Champions League and World Cup qualifiers.
Europol said a five-country probe had identified 380 suspicious matches targeted by a Singapore-based betting cartel, whose illegal activities stretched to players, referees and officials across the world at all levels of the game.
""It is clear to us that this is the biggest investigation ever into suspected match fixing,"" Europol chief Rob Wainwright told a news conference in The Hague, adding that the fall-out hit at the heart of the world game's reputation.
Wainwright said he would be writing to the head of European football's governing body UEFA, Michel Platini, but said all of football needed to ""heed the warning"" and be on their guard.
The revelations come after Interpol last month warned that global football corruption was helping to fuel the criminal underworld's domination of prostitution, drug-trafficking and gun-running and in the wake of several high-profile scandals.
They include the so-called ""calcioscommesse"" or illegal football betting affair in Italy, which overshadowed the country's preparations for last year's European championships and saw several top footballer's arrested.
In the latest claims, Europol said that at least 425 referees, players and other officials were suspected of involvement, with matches rigged so that major sums of money could be won through betting.
Most of the allegedly fixed matches were played in the Turkish, German and Swiss championships, but other matches around the world are also concerned.
Two of Europe's Champions League matches and some World Cup qualifiers are also suspected, Europol said.
No details were given about which top-flight matches were involved because some investigations were still on-going, although it was revealed that one of the Champions League matches had been played in England.
Criminals made over eight million euros ($11 million)in profits from betting on fixed matches.
The probe was carried out by Europol and five European countries: Germany, Hungary, Slovenia, Finland, Austria.
German chief investigator Friedhelm Althans said that showed ""the true horrifying nature of the problem"" and the implications were stark, including financial losses for legal betting firms, clubs, players and the trust of the supporting public.
""Operating from Singapore by heads of this organisation, bribes of up to 100,000 euros per match were paid in cash, which was taken all over the world by money couriers,"" he added.
FIFA's own ""corruption-buster"", former Interpol executive Ralph Mutschke, also said last month that no league in the world was safe from corruption, amid calls for common legislation to tackle the scourge of bribery in sport.
The international nature of match-fixing was highlighted by the case involving Singapore businessman Wilson Raj Perumal, who was suspected of rigging games in several countries and was jailed in Finland in 2011.",en,web

"I am going on a two week trip in May (starting May 14th) to visit friends in Europe and stopping on the way back to visit my little brother (wrapping up his first year in medical school in St. Louis) to go spend Memorial Day in Chicago. I'm really excited to take a solid two weeks off of work, but I'm not sure how to pack lightly for such a long trip, as I usually just do weekend trips.
The details: I will be in each location no longer than 3-4 days and I'll be staying with friends, so I will have access to a washer/dryer. I'm going to England and Norway where it's very likely to be cold/rainy and of course Chicago is always unpredictable in May, so layers will be important. I'll be in Norway for Norwegian Constitution Day, so I'll need to wear a long(ish) dress/skirt since my friends will be wearing suits or national costumes.
I'd love to take just a backpack (I have a very large one) as there will be a full day in London where I'll be carrying my luggage with me and I don't want it to limit my sightseeing. I dress very modestly (don't wear skirts/shorts above the knee, don't show shoulder, back, cleavage, etc.), but I will be seeing an ex-boyfriend in Chicago, so it's very important to me I look my best :) I'm 5'8"", a size 10 dress & shoe, with dark hair and fair complexion.
Tee - These $5 t-shirts from Forever 21 are my new favorite. The loose ""boyfriend"" cut is trendy but also comfortable to wear on a long flight.
Jeans - Your favorite straight leg pair in a dark wash. Avoid ""stretch"" fabrics that will start to sag as you travel.
Jacket - In dark linen with little ruffles. Linen is a great fabric for a range of temperatures and looks classy even when wrinkled.
Flats - In gray suede.
Dress - A little red dress in versatile jersey. Casual enough to wear with flats sightseeing during the day or with pumps to get dressed up at night.
Pumps - In blue.
Bring a couple versatile layering pieces, an umbrella and a puffy jacket that packs up in case of cold weather. Anything else you need, you can buy along the way. Including the outfit for Norwegian Constitution Day - see if you can improvise with some borrowed some pieces from friends instead of buying and dragging around things you wont wear again.
Have a great trip!",en,unknown

The Prep Forest step requires a decision on the location for OCS Global Settings – you can choose to store these in the System container in the root domain (default and recommended) or the Configuration partition which is replicated Forest-wide.
Author: Andrew Sniderman
Publication date: April 2008
Product version: Office Communications Server 2007 R2
Refer to the OCS AD guide for addition detail on Active Directory Global Settings and Objects.http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb803604.aspx
Factors to consider for storing OCS Global Settings:
TipIf LCS/OCS is running into issues because of poor root connectivity – this typically shows up in poor MMC performance and errors in LCS/OCS server event logs – you can remove LCS/OCS from the forest and then rerun Prep Forest choosing the configuration partition. To remove LCS, first deactivate and remove all LCS and OCS servers, remove Prep Domain configuration (use the DomainUnPrep Action with LCSCmd.exe) and remove Prep Forest configuration (use the ForestUnPrep Action with LCSCmd.exe).

"With Breaking Bad, viewers should know by now that nothing stays good for long. As I mentioned last week, the gut punch may not be in how things may eventually end up, but the way they get there. In prior seasons we’ve been teased, often week to week, with cryptic scenes or images without context whose significance, once revealed, is almost nothing like what we could have imagined. The pink, one-eyed bear in the pool and the body bags in the driveway from Season Two are great examples, but it’s those twists and turns and layers that make the show so engaging and addictive. The tease that kicked off this season with Walt celebrating his 52nd birthday alone, in another state, with an alias has not yet been solved, though we’ve gotten pieces of how he got there (Mike’s documents, for example), and a glimpse at a few hints (the cough). What we do know for sure is that the ride from Point A (the mid-season finale) to Point B (that diner scene) is going to be wild. Hit the jump for why you may need to stock up on anxiety meds for 2013.
“Gliding Over All” may not have been as literally explosive as some of the other Breaking Bad finales, but it has set up a great and terrifying game between Hank and Walt (where for once Walt will not have the advantage) to propel the series into its final run of episodes. Was it predicted that Hank would find out about Walt at some point? Sure — but Hank finding out by sitting on the crapper after Walt was already out of the game, finding a note from Gale to Walt where he used the same language and phrase as one Hank had pointed out to Walt from Gale’s notes long ago … that was novel. Did anyone else feel extraordinarily apprehensive in the scene leading up to that reveal? Knowing that happiness and contentment never last long on the show, every member of that outdoor party seemed a suspect in something big that was about to happen (or a potential victim). And Marie was wearing yellow!! What doth that portend but terrible things??
I wasn’t sure I believed Walt when he said he was out, but Walt was never more trustworthy than in this episode. He entered into a genuine partnership with Lydia, he spoke evenly and with grave intention to the thugs he paid to off Mike’s nine guys, and he even paid Jesse. When he told Skyler he was out, after everything everyone has been through in this arc, it seemed unfathomable. But its truth was essential in making Hank’s hunt of Walt all the trickier.
Back to the other biggest moment of the night, poor Jesse continued to get manipulated by Walt’s whims. He wants him in, he wants him out, he wants to give him the money, he doesn’t want to give him the money … Todd has proven to be an extremely worthy and competent replacement for Jesse, but Todd will never have the bond with Walt like Jesse. The tense moment where the two reminisced about the Bounder and the memories of that old RV were strangely touching, and to see the range of Jesse’s feelings from fear to wariness to apprehension to, ultimately, relief was emotional to watch. It was also sad to see him beat himself up again over not trusting Walt when Walt did come through for him. Oh Jesse, if you only knew. Thank God you don’t. Yet.
Then there was that little doctor’s visit thrown in among the chaos. Many didn’t believe that Walt was in fact in remission, and it’s difficult to know which way the tide has turned. But it seems like the cancer may be back now, and it’s just another of the elements of Walt’s past returning to haunt him. The paper towel dispenser he punched represented the cancer, then Gale rose from the dead to stab Walt in the back — who (or what) is next? (Even a fly made an appearance! We know how much Walt hates flies …) Walt’s watch ticking away the time suggested the cyclical nature of events. Is karma already coming for him?
For the Walt apologists, I want to point out a recent LA Times interview with series creator Vince Gilligan where he says that he believes in a hell, and he believes Walt is headed straight there. As for redemption, he agrees it’s a tricky thing. But that almost (almost) doesn’t matter — in the end, it may be more about the people around Walt and their futures than his (which seems set). Is the family he wanted to protect going to be ok? Or torn apart like none of them could ever imagine?
Though I feel too keyed up to really process that it will be a year until we get more, I do feel that “Gliding Over All” did give a sense of completion for this arc. Part One of this final season had some great, iconic series moments, it wasn’t the most engaging Breaking Bad has ever been. Instead, it’s laid a thick foundation and set up a great final series completion next summer. Next summer!! What are we supposed to do until then? Keep calm and purple on …
– One of my favorite things about the series is how the homes on the show really look and feel like homes. They never have that extraordinarily bright effect of stage lights (like anyone’s home is ever that bright and clear). There are lamps, there is natural light, there are shades drawn. It’s very natural, and I love it.
– When Todd’s uncle said he couldn’t get the job done like Walt wanted, I said to the TV “Don’t tell Walt what he can’t do!” I think Walt and John Locke would have gotten along.
– Great music tonight — Crystal Blue Persuasion for one.
– Also some fantastic montages, from the Godfather-esque killing of the nine to the meth making and cash counting to the passage of time between Walt saying he’s out and that backyard party.
– Did not expect Walt to pack the ricin for his visit with Lydia … (who has great outfits, by the way. Are her neutral tones supposed to suggest neutrality?)
– Speaking of colors, the blue was strong tonight with the pool and its reflections, Walt and Skyler’s clothes and of course the storage units.
– Marie Purple Count: 8+ – rug, pillows, purple kid pants, chair covers, picture, kitchen counter stuff, chair, zip-up jacket.
– Who knew the Czech Republic was so into meth?
– “10 trees is better than chasing monsters.” — Hank LOOKING AT THE MONSTER!
– Thanks Skyler, I have GOT to remember to spray my money stacks for silverfish.
– See you in 2013…",en,unknown
"If Superman had explored these issues instead of bashing unions and promoting charters, moviegoers might have walked away understanding a great deal about why the families it profiled and so many similar families across America face a bleak educational future.
The movie certainly showed scenes of poverty, but its implications and the structural inequalities underlying that poverty were largely ignored. Devastating urban poverty was just there -- as if that were somehow the natural order of things but if we could only ‘fix’ schools it would disappear.
While you’re reading it, keep this chart in mind (from Alex Knapp at Outside the Beltway):
I’ve complained before about our schools’ obsession with behavior management at the expense of thought and inquiry. But I can see why the people in the blue slice above might be more interested in teaching the kids in the yellow slice to behave than in teaching them to question things.

"Think You Need to Hire an Associate?
A NEW WAY TO MOVE YOUR PRACTICE FORWARD
Think You Need to Hire an Associate?
You may be able to absorb the patient volume yourself, make patients happier, and take home more money.
Special Section Sponsored By OD Lean
Your patient load is increasing. Maybe a partner is leaving your practice, maybe you're buying an existing practice that you want to run solo, or maybe you're just in a very fast-growing area. You could hire an associate for $80,000, but is there a way to absorb the volume and increase your take-home revenue?
When Stephen M. Pullen, OD, of Family Eyecare in Jacksonville, Fla. bought into a practice 8 years ago, the two existing partners began reducing their hours, eventually reaching the combined equivalent hours of one full-time employee. Facing their reduced hours, Dr. Pullen asked ODLean, “How can I keep the volume of a two-doctor practice with just one doctor?”
This is familiar ground for folks at ODLean, who helped Dr. Pullen become his own associate by absorbing the volume, increasing patient satisfaction and capture rates, and boosting take-home revenue. And the solution might surprise you: Create a patient-centered model.
A Faster, Better Experience
ODLean advisors first gathered data about the practice and made detailed, timed, videotaped observations of patient encounters, then they reported their analysis to Dr. Pullen. Together, they streamlined the practice by implementing a patient-centered model.
“Patients no longer wait when they come in, and we eliminated redundant pre-testing. They move through the office much more smoothly and efficiently,” explains Dr. Pullen.
ODLean also looked at the workload summary of all employees and found that Dr. Pullen was working at 110% capacity, which would lead to burnout. The rest of the staff was working at 50% to 80% capacity.
“We set a goal to distribute the workload more evenly and get everybody, including me, to 85% capacity. And that's what we've actually achieved,” Dr. Pullen says. “Now I spend my time with patients doing the things only a doctor can do—not things that staff can do. And everyone on my staff has loved it. They feel more empowered, like they have a vested interest in the patient experience.”
When Less Is More
Now Dr. Pullen is seeing all of the patients in his practice, and he, his staff—and most importantly, his patients—are happier.
“When we had two doctors, we saw about 25 patients per day, and now I see about 30 patients. I spend less time with each patient overall, but because I've delegated to my staff, I spend less time collecting data, so I can give patients more face time,” he says.
Dr. Pullen's patients offer feedback that mirrors other ODLean practices. “Patients say they're receiving excellent care and that [our practice] obviously values their time,” he says. “They say I'm very thorough, they have plenty of time with me, and they have a good experience. It's rewarding to read that.”
When More Is More
Patients are seeing Dr. Pullen for slightly less time but they're feeling extremely satisfied. But sometimes, more is more. Here are the numbers:
• Gross revenue: Year over year (YOY) is averaging 5% higher than corresponding practices
• Comp exams/doctor/day: up 19% vs flat to significantly down in corresponding practices
• Net revenue per doctor: increased 35% vs a typical YOY change of 2.5%
• Revenue per patient: +20% vs +4% for similar practices
• Combined CL & spectacle capture rate: +13% vs +6% in similar practices
ODLean showed Dr. Pullen that when the overall visit is shorter, patients have time to shop. That income and the absorbed patient volume go directly toward net revenues, which are already boosted by a decreased payroll.
“When colleagues say, ‘You must be cranking people through like cattle,’ I explain to them that it's actually the exact opposite,” Dr. Pullen says. “In a patient-centered practice, I see more patients, but the experience has more value because we eliminate wasted steps. It's about delivering the best patient experience, and I consider the higher numbers a side benefit.”

RACING: Cole's tribute to Generous
10:00am Wednesday 16th January 2013 in Sport
Paul Cole led the tributes to his Epsom Derby winner Generous, who has died at the age of 25.
The chestnut colt with the flaxen mane provided Cole’s Whatcombe stables, near Wantage, with an unforgettable summer in 1991.
With Alan Munro in the saddle, Generous won the Ever Ready Derby at Epsom by five lengths at 9-1, before taking the Irish Derby by three lengths and the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes by seven lengths.
Cole said he felt privileged to have been associated with Generous.
“It’s the end of an era and a sad day for everyone in the Generous clan,” he said.
“He was Generous by name, and generous by nature.
“He was a horse who always gave his all and, if anything, tried a bit too hard.
“He was a very good stayer with sprinter’s speed and from a very fast family.
“Trainers hope they can get hold of a very special horse and I’m very lucky to have had Generous.”
Owned by Prince Fahad Salman, the son of Caerleon was unable to go out in a blaze of glory when he finished unplaced behind Suave Dancer in the Prix de l’Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp.
But he retired to stud as a champion three-year-old with a record of six wins from 11 starts, that yielded £1,119,943 in prize-money, and helped make Cole champion trainer in 1991.
Generous was also a top juvenile, springing a 50-1 surprise in the Dewhurst Stakes at Newmarket in October 1990 under Richard Quinn before finishing fourth in the 2000 Guineas on his seasonal return.
Munro said: “I’m very saddened by the news. He was a very good horse.”
He stood at Alfred Buller’s Scarvagh House Stud in Northern Ireland in his later life, producing German Group 1 winner Catella, but his career as a stallion failed to match his raceourse exploits.
Buller said: “He was unbelievably intelligent for a horse, kind and truly regal.
“He will be sadly missed and, to all involved with him, it has been a privilege to have cared for him and looked after him during his last period of life.

"Apple's Black Friday Sales Begin Around the World
Apple's Black Friday sales have begun around the world in their New Zealand store and Australia stores. The sales show modest discounts similar to previous years.
The only Macs that are on sale include the iMac and the MacBook. When translated to U.S. dollars, the discounts appear to be about $100 for mid-to-high end MacBooks and iMacs and about $50 for the entry level models. These discounts are consistent with last year's Black Friday sale and also consistent with whispers we've heard. If it holds true for U.S. pricing, it also dashes unfounded analyst predictions that Apple would offer 15% discounts.
Apple is also providing discounts on the iPod nano, iPod classic and iPod touch as well as discounts on a number of accessories.
We previously detailed sales at online retailers on Macs, and will post an update with more Black Friday deals tonight.
Update: Final Black Friday sales have been posted with deals from retailers up to $300 off the MacBook Pro.",en,web
"HISD Superintendent Terry Grier Sings The Banana Song
|Photos by Margaret Downing|
Not since the days of former superintendent Billy Reagan has the Houston media had a chance to sit down in a media roundtable with the superintendent of the Houston ISD, but Tuesday morning Superintendent Terry Grier rejuvenated the discarded tradition and invited the Houston Press and others in for a talk and a typical school breakfast.
And he capped off his first monthly session with a demonstration of the best way to peel a banana (pinch it at the top and the yellow skin just rolls right off.)
Grier took the opportunity to pitch the recent expansion of the school district's free breakfast program, promising that by packing breakfast into more kids, great results will follow -- and more than just the increased federal subsidy money the district will be getting. Kids will study better, learn more, and behave better for their teachers if they have something other than growling tigers in their stomachs to get them through the day. In fact, Grier somehow worked it around that the district will be saving $2 million with its additional orders through the Aramark food service because buying in greater bulk means more discounts on the pricing.
Of course the district has touted its breakfast program before, but when Houston Press' Sarah Fenske did an on-site visit at Jefferson Davis High School in 2004, she found many of the breakfasts weren't actually eaten. And that the teacher checkoff lists, showing how much had been eaten, bore little reality to the inspected coolers returned to the cafeteria.
As representatives of Aramark looked on, Grier says all that's changed now. The district and Aramark have made the meals much more nutritional (HISD is apparently the anti-Philadelphia, which got caught handing out Krispy Kreme donuts to the kids when it instituted a breakfast program, according to Grier) and yet somehow more enticing to the kids, he says, which is really a wow and maybe the district can make some money off that selling its secret to other districts, and parents. They even had kids taste-test prospective items.
In the interests of front line duty, Hair Balls/Eating...Our Words (in dual persona form) ate the breakfast. The turkey ham (HISD has moved away from serving pork because of cultural/religious reasons for some kids, and won't the right-wing radio stations love that?) and cheese sandwich tasted enjoyably greasy, the biscuit on the fried chicken sandwich was a little dry but the chicken was great. The muffin (bran? wheat? not sure) was sweet and moist. In sum: Not bad at all.
For a lot of kids, the only two meals they get each day are at school, Grier says, so the free breakfast and lunch program makes a huge difference in kids' lives. There had been reports that serving breakfast was just too much trouble, but they checked with schools and found that not to be the case. Free breakfasts may cut into some instructional time, but give teachers a chance to teach responsibility when they get kids to not make a mess while eating and to clean up after themselves.
""It was not the calamity of errors that people opposing the program said it was."" Grier says.
Looking at a month's breakfast calendar, we saw a range of items with a lot of sausage, egg and cheese biscuits and yogurt. Also, surprisingly enough given all the emphasis on nutrition: Pop-Tarts. Now it's a ""whole grain Pop-Tart,"" but still? To be fair, Julie Spreckelmeyer, an Aramark liaison with HISD's food service, pointed out the Pop-Tarts, saying they are on their way out.The superintendent also talked at length about teacher evaluation standards and firing bad teachers, but we'll save that for another post.",en,web

"May 3, 2012 The head of the European Central Bank said today that economic growth has to be central to the plan to get Europe out of its debt crisis
Apr 5, 2012 There are some economic headwinds blowing strong right now. And one of them is coming from Spain where a disappointing bond auction yesterday sent government borrowing costs to a 5 month high and renewed fears about the European Debt Crisis.
Feb 16, 2012 As the U.S. economy improves measurably, Europe slips into crisis mode.
Dec 22, 2011 What looks like a major success now may end up being more of a modest win in the future against the mounting debt crisis in the eurozone.
Dec 22, 2011 The European Central Bank yesterday printed $640 billion worth of euros, almost the same amount of money as the TARP program used by the U.S. government during the financial crisis in 2008.
Dec 22, 2011 As Spain gears up for new leadership, the European Union wants airlines to reduce emissions or pay for permits allowing them to pollute. During the holidays, consumers generate as much as 25 percent more waste from packaging, unused holiday cards and wrapping paper, and other seasonal items. In some Atlanta neighborhoods, houses are selling for under 10,000 -- less than the price of many used cars.
Dec 21, 2011 The news that more banks than expected are putting a hand out for help from the European Central Bank had markets on a roller coaster today.

"Second day of racing & two first races
On Tuesday there was again a wind warning up to 25 knots plus a nasty swell from the previous days. Also the more sheltered inner race course does not work too well in southerly winds. Hence another postponement was given to start the second day as well.
Finally, before 11am the fleet was sent out and the first race started in nearly perfect conditions. A surprisingly strong counter current gave the helmsmen some headache while trying to hold their positions on the start line.
The modern class was under way shortly after 1pm. At the first rounding the Swedish team of “Sting”, skippered by Thomas Lundqvist, was in the lead. Sting was closely followed by the French boat “Junior” and the Swiss “Temptation”.
The reigning world champion, Sweden’s “Sophie II”, skippered by Hugo Stenbeck, managed to overtake the leading trio and took home the first race of the World Cup.
In the classics, Finnish yacht “TOY” started in the middle of the starting line and tacked inshore immediately. The replacement helmsman, Jali Mäkilä, with the experienced crew of TOY found better winds on the right side of the course and built a convincing lead by the first rounding. The TOYboys had no difficulties in holding and even extending their lead, while another Finnish entry, “Fridolin” helmed by Henrik Lundberg took second with a huge margin to the next boat. Canadian entries “Gallant” (reigning world champions) and “Saskia” battled it out for 3rd and 4th with Saskia skippered by Don Martin being stronger at the end. The Finnish champions on “Sara af Hangö” took fifth place.
In Tuesday’s second race the wind picked up a little while some scary looking thunder fronts surrounded the race course. With some luck the race could be sailed in reasonable conditions. A wind shift during the first lap made the second beat more of a speed contest with boats all lining up for the second top mark rounding. This took away all major tactical opportunities for the chasing boats and early leaders could just protect their positions by making no mistakes in their boat handling.
In the modern fleet French “Junior” lead through the race until the finish line. Second was British yacht “Valhalla” while “Sophie II” took third place.
In the Classics a black flag was put up on the second start attempt and two Finnish boats, “May Be IV” and “Bambi” were flagged out of the race. First race winner “TOY” was also too early on the line and had to make an extra loop when the gun went. They could only recover to a modest 18th place from their failed start.
2009 world champions “Gallant” showed great form again and lead pretty much from start to finish. The Finnish runner-up from 2009 World Cup, “Fridolin”, took another second and snatched the overall lead in classics after two races. Third was “Sara af Hangö” and fourth another Finnish entry “Ali-Baba II”.
Leaders after 2 races:
- Junior, FRA
- Sophie, SWE
- May Be XIV, SWE
- Sting, SWE
- Valhalla, GBR
- Fridolin, FIN
- Gallant, CAN

"I sew. Lots. Almost everyday. Only 10 percent of what I make ends up in my etsy shop. The rest goes on me, my kids and some very choice friends and family. If I had a dog, I'd probably sew ridiculous outfits for it too. Man, it would be one lucky dog.
And here it is folks... me in a moomoo with 60 lbs of of maternity weight gain. No worries, this is my third pregnancy and every single one I gained the same 60 lbs. I'm schedule to be induced on Monday. Any bets on how big this baby's going to be? I fed her a lot of of ice cream and hot cocoa these past nice months ;)
I intend to live in this moomoo for the next two weeks. It's super comfy, and the shoulders come completely unsnapped for convenient nursing.
I fell in love with this fabric at Joann's. Usually I'm a bit of a fabric snob, but I totally give this non-designer print a huge thumbs up. Check out those adorable little bees!
While sewing a mother/daughter top and dress set for a friend, Ashlyn asked me if I could make her a dress too. With Valentine's Day around the corner, I figured I'd make it red and pink with a ruffle heart embellishment. Cheesy, I know.... these pregnancy hormones make me do crazy things.
Oh, and here is the mother daughter set:
And here's a pic of Denny and Ashlyn... I thought it was so cute that Ashlyn slung her arm around Denny while he was reading to her. He rolled his eyes, but let her keep her arm there. Such a good big brother :)

Luckily it got stuck in an add on armor plate and I was able to reach down and get it and start firing it.,en,web
"Recipe by Lotte Duncan
- 225g basmati rice
- 1 medium onion, finely
- 1 small leek, finely
- 2 tsps ground coriander
- 2 tsps ground cumin
- 2 tsps ground turmeric
- ½ tsp chilli powder
- 275g smoked salmon, cut into strips
- 4 tsps double cream
- 2 heaped tbsps fresh parsley
- zest and juice of 1 lemon
- 4 hard-boiled eggs, quartered (see Lotte’s tips)
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper
- Lemon wedges and fresh parsley, to garnish
How to make Smoked Salmon Kedgeree
I just love the flavour cooked smoked salmon brings to a dish. In fact if I’m completely honest I only really like smoked salmon when it’s hot, I prefer the texture. And what’s wonderful about this recipe is the fact that you don’t have to faff around cooking the fish first – toss it all in together, give it a stir and enjoy!
Cook the basmati rice according to the packet instructions. Rinse the cooked rice with boiling water and cool.
Melt thein a large, non-stick frying pan or wok and add the onion and leek. Cook gently for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally and then add all the dry spices and cook gently for 1-2 minutes.
Add the rice and stir for 1-2 minutes so the rice takes up the colour and flavour of the spices.
Toss the salmon into the pan and stir in the cream. Next add the parsley and lemon zest and juice. Season with a little salt and pepper and spoon into a serving dish.
Scatter over the cooked egg and garnish with the lemon wedges andparsley.

"You can easily get, and maintain, the MP to nearly main heal a party with a little effort.
Yeah, I think not, considering how in most of the kinds of parties I seem I get, I struggle to heal for even on RDM or WHM because the frontline absolutely sucks at mitigating their own damage.
I've solo healed dozens of merit pts on brd. It's really not that hard, as long as you got a cor for evoker's. With 2-3/tic evoker's, 3/tic ballad, vermy, and sanction, for 7-8/tic refresh it's really not too hard to keep mp up. And of course brd uses less mp than rdm/whm, since they don't have to haste. And that's without /sch's -10% mp cost, sublimation, and aspir. If you can't keep mp up with all that, then either your dds suck too much to be worth partying with, or urdoinitrong.
Just .dat swap it out, it's not like you'll ever get banned for it.
I'm pretty sure even if you do this (which is quite obviously cheating), you still get the attack delay added on.
If not, then it's even more of a cheat than I've realized.
It does nothing more than blinking the cast would do. The only advantage would be that other people can't spell lock you when (dis)engaging, or standing up, which you otherwise have no control over. Edited, May 17th 2010 8:46pm by ThePsychoticOne",en,web

"Q.DEAR BILLY GRAHAM: What good does it do to believe in God? I’ve tried to believe and go to church and everything, but so far it hasn’t made any difference in my life. If anything, things are worse. — J.W.
By BILLY GRAHAM
Tribune Media Services
A. DEAR J.W.: The most important thing I can tell you is that God loves you and wants to come into your life so you can know him and have a personal relationship with him.
From what you say, this hasn’t been your experience so far, but it can be, as you turn to Christ in repentance and faith, and invite him to come into your life. You see, only one thing separates us from God, and that’s our sin. But God still loves us in spite of our sins and has provided the way for us to be forgiven and cleansed of sin. That way is Jesus Christ, who became the final and complete sacrifice for our sins by dying for us on the cross.
Ask Jesus to come into your life today — and he will. Then ask him to guide you to a church where you can grow spiritually. Your life will never be the same.

"Whole green toys, diapers, clothing, bedding, bath, school supplies, and more.
In 2003, Deron Beal started the Freecycle Network, working with a dream and a loose network of willing friends in the Tucson, Arizona area. Beal saw a lot of perfectly good stuff being thrown away, so he and his associates started offering the unwanted goods to local nonprofit groups for free. After expending a lot of shoe leather, they took the concept online with an email network to match free goods with willing recipients.
Soon Freecycle was national, then international. It has grown to more than 85 countries, involving (at last count) 4,619 groups and almost six million members. The group says it keeps 500 tons of material a day out of landfills, annually equivalent to a stack of garbage trucks five times the height of Mount Everest.
Taking part is simple enough. Enter your state in the finder on the Web site home page, and local groups pop up. You do have to join the local group, but it’s free. And of course you can post your own free stuff, providing a short description and an approximate location.

"Now, I don't know if anyone else has thought of this already, but I have a new gusset option for my britches pattern. I'm super excited. While I love my original gusset, it's roominess and the fact that you can knit from the legs up, I'm smitten with this new gusset. It is very very easy knit and still allows for a nice wide leg, though it only works for the top-down version (I'll figure it out bottom-up some day, the concept is in my head, I just haven't done it yet). I'm putting the finishing touches on the directions and will release it tomorrow to everyone who is on the britches yahoo group.
Also, I am revamping the whole pattern. Better pictures, more options, clarified wording on some directions that were ambiguous before. I'm adding a ""no options, just the basics"" beginner pattern that I'm hoping will be a great how-to-knit-longies for a new knitter. Since Adorabubble Britches has been out almost a year now (boy, does time fly), I've gotten lots of feedback, many great questions from beginners and suggestions that will be incorporated into this pattern. Since it is just the basics, I will be offering the beginner pattern for just $4. It will be seperate from the whole Adorabubble Britches pattern, but will come with a coupon for a discount on the big Adorabubble Britches pattern. So, if you like the beginner pattern and want all the options later, you won't have to fork over a ton :-)
I'm also hard at work on the sideways britches pattern, though this one is a little further away from completion than the others. And yes, a soaker pattern is in the future. Lots of fun stuff to come!",en,web
"When I was little I watched over and over — really, I truly, truly loved it — a Masterpiece Theater about three sisters who every night would go to a magical ball, only after the castle is completely asleep. To get to the ball, a porthole opened in their room that led to an enchanted, snow-covered wood and a river, which they crossed on rowboats guided by the three male princes. Every morning, their mother would wake them up and groan over how difficult it was to get the girls out of bed, and every week a maid would grimace over how they had worn out their best dancing slippers. Something was afoot, but they could not name it.
I could look up the plot — but it isn’t the truth that matters to me now, it’s the story in my head. Next: the parents suspected the daughters of something terrible, something grave, and so locked them in their room; but of course, the girls could still reach the porthole, which was within it. Held to questioning, one of the sisters told of the magical ball. To prove it, she brought back a branch of silvery pine and held it out to her father saying Look, look, it’s real — the trees, the lake, the dancing, and the princes who take us. Here is a metonymy for you, a length of wood.
But maybe what happened was that walking, she was snagged in the tree, her dress hitched, and they found, entangled in her silks the next day, a branch.
In any case I had not thought of the story for so long. In the end, only the best sister — pure, for some reason that the others are not — marries a magical prince. Perhaps the others are tattle-tales, who give it away. Perhaps they choose the life of reality over the one of fiction.
When I thought of the story today for the first time in years I thought, of course: here is a lesson to parents about raising teenage girls; or here is a lesson to teenage girls about sleeping around, about letting boys into your bedrooms: You will be caught, snagged. You will grasp for him and find only a branch, as evidence. Here is a eulogy for the high schoolers heading out to parties in Potomac, who crash their SUVs on River Road and kill themselves and all their riders — this is the fairy tale for them, who live forever in silent rowboats on dark water, captained by strangers who promise in the distance a glimmering ball.
I think also it is a parable for dreams, which you can never prove with props or worn-out shoes; and of course as well a parable for romance, which comes to us at night, and wears off in the strange light of the morning; or maybe a parable for love — for the sister who found it — for it comes to us at first through a fiction as if of our own making — it’s our thoughts of him, at first, that woo us. And it’s when you’ve got to prove it, you’ve got to find the branch or not find the branch, you may find that you have nothing at all as evidence; or you might find that you are caught there, and can never row back, and that your sisters — beautiful as they had seemed to you, then — are now forever collapsed into their own world and that your father, glaring down at you, holds none of his angry power; the world of the dream has become potent, the daytime world of slippers and lace is stupid, stupid as a fairy tale, stupid as a place you leave. The real is now the dream you thought you had invented, and you see it in all of its crisp textures.
Anyway, now I only pity the maid. Repairer of shoes, commiserator with those whose happiness can be found only in double worlds.",en,books

Granville Street, part of the city’s Entertainment District, is a stretch of bars and clubs where you can drink the night away! But Vancouver nightlife is not all about the booze; there are theaters that stand proof of the city’s value for the arts.
As a global city, Vancouver has plenty of high rises, but this does not mean that there is no longer space for some serenity. Actually, Vancouver is home to the world’s vastest urban park! Stanley Park welcomes travelers to a wide range of activities with nature. Rent a bike to go around this park, or you can give your legs some exercise and hike the park’s trails. This park cradles rainforests and give a good view of the seascape.
Another peaceful spot amidst the busy Vancouver city is the Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Garden. Let the lush green grass and Chinese structures soothe your restless spirit.
A Challenge to Get Active
Surrounding Vancouver and the rest of Canada are beautiful mountain ranges. Come winter, these mountains draw extreme sports enthusiasts because of the challenging slopes. Skiers love Canada as soon as snow sets in. When the ice melts during summer, the mountains are still a big draw for tourists who want to bike and climb.
Vancouver is a city that suits all interests. Whether you’re the type who cannot live without the urban air, or you are the nature-loving tourist, you’ll find Vancouver most amusing. Explore this global city now! Fly to Vancouver Canada for free!",en,web

"The word “queer” is interesting to me. I don’t think there’s a single person who isn’t aware that the word used to have a negative connotation, that it was an insult.
More recently, though, it’s been “reclaimed.” It’s come to be an umbrella term, covering those who don’t feel like they fit into the “standard categories.”
That being said, I don’t really care for it. I guess I’m caught up in the past, that I can’t get over what the word used to mean.
So, for that reason, I don’t tend to use it. I really would fit into the “genderqueer” category, but I can’t help but dislike it. I guess the concept of calling my gender “weird” bothers me. After all, I don’t think it’s weird. It’s just part of me, part of who I am. To be honest, I’m not completely bothered that I don’t have a word to describe my gender.
So, queer. Use it if you like, I’m not going to tell you that I don’t think you should. In fact, I commend you if you can. I think it shows strength, to be able to say that while the word used to be a slur, that now you can use it for good.",en,books

"THEY are rhymes rudely strung with intent less|
Of sound than of words,
In lands where bright blossoms are scentless,
And songless bright birds;
Where, with fire and fierce drought on her tresses,
Insatiable Summer oppresses
Sere woodlands and sad wildernesses,
And faint flocks and herds.
Where in dreariest days, when all dews end,
And all winds are warm,
Wild Winter’s large flood-gates are loosen’d,
And floods, freed by storm,
From broken up fountain heads, dash on
Dry deserts with long pent up passion—
Here rhyme was first framed without fashion,
Song shaped without form.
Whence gather’d?—The locust’s glad chirrup
May furnish a stave;
The ring of a rowel and stirrup,
The wash of a wave.
The chaunt of the marsh frog in rushes,
That chimes through the pauses and hushes
Of nightfall, the torrent that gushes,
The tempests that rave.
In the deep’ning of dawn, when it dapples
The dusk of the sky,
With streaks like the redd’ning of apples,
The ripening of rye.
To eastward, when cluster by cluster,
Dim stars and dull planets that muster,
Wax wan in a world of white lustre
That spreads far and high.
In the gathering of night gloom o’erhead, in
The still silent change,
All fire-flushed when forest trees redden
On slopes of the range.
When the gnarl’d, knotted trunks Eucalyptian
Seem carved, like weird columns Egyptian,
With curious device—quaint inscription,
And hieroglyph strange.
In the Spring, when the wattle gold trembles
’Twixt shadow and shine,
When each dew-laden air draught resembles
A long draught of wine;
When the sky-line’s blue burnish’d resistance
Makes deeper the dreamiest distance,
Some song in all hearts hath existence,—
Such songs have been mine.
They came in all guises, some vivid
To clasp and to keep;
Some sudden and swift as the livid
Blue thunder-flame’s leap.
This swept through the first breath of clover
With memories renew’d to the rover—
That flash’d while the black horse turn’d over
Before the long sleep.
To you (having cunning to colour
A page with your pen,
That through dull days, and nights even duller,
Long years ago ten,
Fair pictures in fever afforded)—
I send these rude staves, roughly worded
By one in whose brain stands recorded
As clear now as then,
“The great rush of grey ‘Northern water’,
The green ridge of bank,
The ‘sorrel’ with curved sweep of quarter
Curl’d close to clean flank,
The Royalist saddlefast squarely,
And where the bright uplands stretch fairly,
Behind, beyond pistol-shot barely,
The Roundheaded rank.
“A long launch, with clinging of muscles,
And clenching of teeth!
The loose doublet ripples and rustles!
The swirl shoots beneath!”
Enough. In return for your garland—
In lieu of the flowers from your far land—
Take wild growth of dreamland or starland,
Take weeds for your wreath.
Yet rhyme had not fail’d me for reason,
Nor reason for rhyme,
Sweet Song! had I sought you in season,
And found you in time.
You beckon in your bright beauty yonder,
And I, waxing fainter, yet fonder,
Now weary too soon when I wander—
Now fall when I climb.
It matters but little in the long run,
The weak have some right—
Some share in the race that the strong run,
The fight the strong fight.
If words that are worthless go westward,
Yet the worst word shall be as the best word,
In the day when all riot sweeps restward,
In darkness or light.",en,books
"UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER
March 25, 2008
The Scripps Research Institute and Scripps Health are working to set up what they hope will be the nation's first medical school entirely geared to training physicians for dual careers in research and patient care.
The coordinators, who plan to accept their inaugural group of students in 2013, would make the Scripps School of Medicine the county's first new medical school in 40 years.
They want to receive final accreditation for their school by 2018. Nationally, only one new medical school – at Florida State University – has been fully accredited in the past 20 years, said Dr. Dan Hunt, secretary of the Liaison Committee on Medical Education in Washington, D.C.
That committee's approval is required before medical school graduates can take the licensing exam required by state medical boards.
The Scripps institute must raise $150 million in startup money for the medical school, which would be housed in its campus on the Torrey Pines mesa. The program would enroll up to 50 students each year in a five-year curriculum that offers routine medical school courses, such as anatomy and biology, with subsequent rotations at Scripps Health's hospitals and doctors' offices.
But these students would also receive training in lab work, clinical trials and research topics such as molecular genetics. The goal is to have them bring laboratory discoveries to the patients' bedside.
“There's no other curriculum and design such as this one,” said Dr. Eric Topol, who holds positions with the Scripps institute and Scripps Health.
Although many of the 130 medical schools in the United States offer similar physician-scientist training, they include only a few students at a time, Topol said. Those programs can take as long as nine years, he said.
At the Scripps institute, “students will have a stipulated interest in becoming physician scientists, not only for the care of patients but to conduct research to change the future of medicine,” Topol said.
Chris Van Gorder, president and chief executive officer of Scripps Health, said, “There's no medical school in the world that's dedicated to translational science and developing future scientists.”
Scripps Health's network of five hospitals and several thousand affiliated physicians provide about one-third of the patient care in San Diego County.
The medical school endeavor is a natural extension of training programs and graduate medical education that have been offered for many years through Scripps Health, Van Gorder said.
“I don't think it's going to be that big of a gamble,” he said.
Van Gorder emphasized that the school “will not pull money away from any patient care programs” at Scripps Health. The Scripps institute “is aware of that and expects our contribution to be compensated,” he said.
The institute has not raised any of the money needed for the new school. With an annual operating budget of $400 million, it is the world's largest independent, nonprofit biomedical institute. It already runs an accredited graduate science program with about 200 students.
“It made a lot of sense to expand our program to the medical school arena and see if we could start one,” said Douglas Bingham, the institute's executive vice president and chief operating officer.
Topol, who came to Scripps in January 2007 after working with the Cleveland Clinic and Case Western Reserve University, conceived of the medical school idea in November during a conversation with Bingham.
Topol said the institute has hired Cary Thomas to help establish the program. Thomas was formerly vice dean for finance and operations for the medical school at the University of Southern California.
Several weeks ago, Scripps institute officials paid the liaison committee a $25,000 fee to file its accreditation application. The committee, which requires all medical school applicants to meet 133 standards in five lengthy phases, will visit the facility early next month for the first phase.
It's unusual for a county to have more than one medical school, if it has any. The only one in San Diego County is the 40-year-old UC San Diego School of Medicine.
Dr. David Brenner, its dean, said he supports efforts to expand programs in biomedical research and medical education.
But instead of starting a medical school, he said, the Scripps institute and Scripps Health should consider collaborating with UCSD to “minimize the costly duplication of infrastructure and programs necessary . . . at a time when we are facing cuts in medical education funding at the state and federal levels.”
What Scripps is attempting, Brenner said, is “really hard work.”
Not only do faculty members have to be hired, but new courses must be designed. Conflict-of-interest policies, diversity programs, student loan procedures and reimbursement formulas “all must be established from scratch,” Hunt said.
At first, it may be difficult for Scripps to recruit students because the liaison committee would not give its decision on final accreditation until students from the first class are ready to graduate.
Nationwide, many physicians groups and health policy analysts have decried a shortage of physicians. They see the problem worsening as baby boomers reach the age when they will need more medical care.
There's also a perceived shortage of physicians willing to take care of the uninsured or enter the fields of internal medicine and primary care, which are usually less lucrative than plastic surgery or dermatology.
Additionally, many physicians are retiring or practicing less because of concerns about declining reimbursement from health plans and government payers.
California is expected to be short about 17,000 physicians by 2015.
Several years ago, the Association of American Medical Colleges called on medical schools to expand enrollment by 30 percent to meet the increasing demand for doctors.
In response, some medical schools have raised the number of students they will accept, Hunt said. There were 42,315 applicants nationally for the 2007 school year, but only 17,759 were accepted, he said. That is 8 percent more than in 2002, but it's still far short of what is needed.
This year, the UCSD School of Medicine increased its incoming class size for the first time in decades – from 122 students to 134.
Nine institutions across the country, including the Scripps institute, are seeking accreditation for their medical schools.
“If (Scripps) stays focused on training physicians for a research niche, that might be pretty unique,” Hunt said. “My guess is that as they move toward becoming real, they'll broaden their mission.”",en,web
"Non-Invasive Techniques for Diagnosing Seed Viability
Non-invasive approaches are being developed to enable diagnosis of seed viability without the need for germination testing.
Conventional methods in analytical chemistry and molecular biology are invaluable to study chemical traits of seeds, but they are usually destructive. Recent advances in the development of non-invasive techniques now enable us to study metabolic changes in organisms, although often not with the same level of detail as invasive techniques. In our research into seed traits, we aim to find an appropriate compromise between the use of invasive and non-invasive techniques. The use of non-invasive techniques to diagnose seed viability would allow seed collections to be screened for viability, obviating the need for germination tests, which are seed- and time-consuming and often require specialist knowledge for breaking dormancy. Therefore, a non-destructive test would protect valuable seed collections, and may also serve as an early warning of impeding viability loss to enable intervention such as regeneration or re-collection of seeds.
We tested the use of infrared thermography to detect the temperature changes that occur during imbibition and germination. After constructing a library of “thermal fingerprints” viable and dead Pisum sativum seeds can be distinguished in less than two hours. When a dry seed takes up water, the sugar within the seed dissolves, and this process cools the seed down. Viable seeds maintain cool temperatures because they break down storage reserves into sugar. Aged and dead seeds fail to break down their reserves, or can only break them down after a phase of repair, delaying the thermal profile. So far, such processes were studied with destructive methods whereas the new infrared-based method is a breakthrough in the non-invasive diagnosis of seed quality. Using infrared thermography, viable and dead seeds can be distinguished within three hours of water uptake, a time period short enough to re-dry the seeds and store them again. Importantly, the opportunity to select live and dead seeds prior to germination is a useful tool to improve studies into the fundamental principles of ageing and cell death, which are similar in plants, animals and humans.
We have also used Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) to determine melting properties of seed oil, producing another type of thermal fingerprint based on enthalpy. Compositional variation in oil between species contributes to thermal properties varying by c. 50 °C with implication for storage stability (see ‘Thermal fingerprint and seed storage’ project).
Headspace gas chromatography – mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) is another non-invasive technique that is currently being developed to relate the volatile fingerprint of seeds to the mechanisms of viability loss during seed ageing. Seed volatiles have been studied during artificial ageing of several orthodox seed species, and during desiccation of one recalcitrant seed species. Future work will include more species, and also a comparison with different storage conditions to determine the effect of temperature and relative humidity on the mechanisms of seed ageing.
Finally, together with collaborators at the German Federal Gene Bank, the IPK Gatersleben, we have started assessing the use of high-throughput Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) to non-invasively measure seed water and oil content, both of which are essential determinants of seed longevity in storage.

I carried the anole outside and released him against the siding of my outbuilding, thinking I could get a good, clear photo against the white background. Unfortunately the anole darted under the building before I could get a picture. However, I did get of shot of him earlier when he was pinned against the screen.

"Save Money, Save the Ocean, Save Ourselves
Good Times Weekly
WRITTEN BY WALLACE J. NICHOLS
THURSDAY, 21 AUGUST 2008
As oil prices break records daily and the $75 fill-up becomes standard fare at the corner station, Dow Chemical, purveyor of everything plastic, has been forced to raise prices 20 percent for the second month in a row.
The connections between oil and plastic are numerous. In the past 50 years, these two products have come to dominate our lives. But, over-consumption of both is destroying the ocean. Burning of fossil fuels is changing the climate and warming the ocean. Excess carbon dioxide is making the sea more acidic, destabilizing coral reefs and upsetting the ocean food web. Big oil spills, seepage from ships and residue runoff from roads make a toxic mess of all things aquatic.
Plastic, by the way, is made from oil. It lasts a very long time. And it’s everywhere. It’s in the North Pacific Ocean, for instance, where a continent-sized patch best described as “plastic soup” fills up albatrosses, sea turtles and even plankton that feed unwittingly on the stuff.
The oil ties to the ocean run deeper still. So high are fuel prices, that diesel subsidies are necessary to prop up the fuel-dependent fishing sector, which in turn uses those subsidies to strip the seas of millions upon millions of pounds of fish and wildlife annually. Monofilament lines and ghost nets—made of rugged, non-biodegradable plastic (read: oil)—break free, wander the ocean untended, and reap countless fish, dolphins, turtles, birds and whales along the way.
Oil and plastic and the ocean just don’t mix.
The current Administration’s “solution” to the crisis is to drill for more oil along our coasts and in wildlife refuges. The profits, of course, will fall to the oil companies and plastic manufacturers who seek to expand their sales. Exxon-Mobil and Dow both set new records for profits and sales even as news reports and scientific journals lay out in shocking detail how the ocean is warming, sea level is rising and the Pacific plastic garbage patch is expanding.
What this means to the rest of us is that traveling anywhere, eating at a seafood restaurant and buying just about anything plastic are about to get ridiculously expensive. So, here are a few ways you can pinch some pennies and protect the ocean at the same time:
• First, buy your food local and seasonal. This summer, dig into your farmers’ market and ask for local produce and seafood. Buying local and seasonal require less energy for transport and refrigeration.
• Wash, reuse and refill plastic containers: not just water bottles and shopping bags, but Zip-Loc bags, disposable forks and plastic plates. Better yet, avoid plastic completely. Can you make it through a day without throwing any plastic in the trash? It’s harder than you think (aDayWithoutPlastic.org).
• Instead of a road trip, join the International Coastal Cleanup and spend a day under the blue sky with friends in a global effort to clean local waterways and shores. (coastalcleanup.org).
• Share a ride, walk, bike, or hop a train or bus. If you’re looking to replace your car, go for one that doubles, or even triples, your previous miles-per-gallon. A 2003 Ford Expedition gets 14 mpg. A roomy, next-generation Toyota Prius is said to get nearly 100 mpg.
• Be heard: Tell your elected officials that there are safer, cheaper, smarter solutions to the energy crisis than hasty drilling for more oil along our coasts. And let the politicians who are leading the way to a greener future know that you like their style.
Americans aren’t strangers to this way of thinking. My grandmother called it frugality. To her it was a virtue. Maybe it is old-fashioned or just trendy eco-consciousness, but one thing is certain: the incentives to conserve our ocean and to protect our pocketbooks have never been greater—and, who knows, may come at just the right time to do some good for the ocean.
It’s time for each of us to join the revolution in ocean and energy conservation. Let’s get petroleum and plastic out of the ocean and put the profits back in our own pockets.
Save money. Save the ocean. Maybe even save ourselves.

"Brash Entertainment announced today that key Hollywood talent from the upcoming animated movie, Space Chimps, will be featured in their videogame of the same name. Cheryl Hines (Curb Your Enthusiasm, RV) and Patrick Warburton (Bee Movie, Seinfeld) reprise their roles from the movie, Luna and Titan respectively, for the videogame. Based on the highly anticipated film produced by Vanguard Animation and presented by Starz Animation, the videogame is slated for release on July 15, 2008, just days before the film's July 18, 2008 debut.
In the Space Chimps game, players follow the adventures of pioneering primates on a mission into outer space. Cheryl Hines as Luna, is a by the books, go-getting chimp, who graduated top of her astronaut training class. As the interactive plot of the game unfolds, Luna's level head becomes an asset, and players take control of the character to explore alien territories and complete quests that explore lands and characters beyond the plot of the movie. Patrick Warburton as Titan, is the commanding officer of their space craft, and uses his deep stern voice to keep his crew in line. However, his quick temper and tendency to go bananas makes leading a squad difficult at times for this commanding chimp.
""I think it is really fun to have a videogame that goes along with the movie,"" explained Cheryl Hines, who voices Luna in Space Chimps the game and the film. ""It gives fans a chance to be part of the movie by playing as their favorite characters, while exploring new adventures.""
Space Chimps the game will be available for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 2 computer entertainment system, and the Wii and Nintendo DS videogame systems from Nintendo. The game is rated 'E' by the ESRA and will be available at retailers nationwide July 15, 2008.

"The Logan Square Farmers Market, whose future looked murky earlier this month, will go on after all, Alderman Rey Colon (35th) announced late this afternoon.
This still left open the question of whether or not the alderman would give his needed blessing for street closings and waiver requests for the market to go on.
Late this afternoon, however, Colon said he gave his OK after the formation of a new “advisory panel made up of several different stakeholders from the market.” He said he submit the needed aldermanic request for the permits and fee waivers.
""I am happy about this resolution,” Colon said Friday afternoon. “It alleviates my concerns and allows some of the stakeholders of the farmers market to have a greater voice. ... I’m very excited at the outcome.”
The market “has been operating for seven years and it has reached a point where it can continue to grow and thrive,” he said. “The market isn’t just a Logan Square asset.

"NEW YORK – Gone are mystique and aura, the two temptresses of the Bronx, who blessed old Yankee Stadium with kismet and joy and brilliant baseball. In their stead are apathy and malaise, a couple of hags from Yonkers. They embody the new Yankee Stadium, a sarcophagus if ever there was one: no matter how gorgeous and ornate the outside, it remains filled with lifelessness. No wonder Game 2 of the ALCS featured thousands of empty seats, like Game 1 before it, and like the do-or-die Game 5 of the ALDS, too. New Yorkers understand a fraud when they see it. They pay for expensive seats, drink overpriced beers, buy exorbitant merchandise and fund a $200 million joke, a team that for the second straight game couldn’t score a measly run off the Detroit Tigers’ Nos. 3 and 4 starting pitchers. These Yankees earned every last boo. It wasn’t just the ushers instructed to fill in empty seats so the crowd looked better on TV. The players can tell, too. “This is a very easy place to play now,” Tigers outfielder Quintin Berry said. “Coming from Oakland, the fans there were so rowdy. It was easier to come here.” Oakland Coliseum, where tarps cover the upper deck, more electric than Yankee Stadium. Every other playoff stadium filled to capacity, and Yankee Stadium with entire sections empty, thousands of unsold tickets, even ones as cheap as $15 through resellers.
I don’t know whats more embarrassing – the Yankees play on the field or the fans behavior off of it. Literally the only time Yankees fans are making any noise is boo their own team. Spend all their time hating Arod and bashing Swisher and complaining how they deserve better. Create more problems for their own team than they do for the opposition when the Yanks are at home. Hey you fucking dickheads you’re only making it worse. You and the media are half the problem with this franchise right now.
And Yankees fans will try to spin this however they want. On Friday evening’s game 5 against Baltimore the stadium was legitimately like 60% empty. Of course Yankees fans blamed “having jobs” and “traffic” as the reason for that. Like Nationals Park wasn’t rocking at 1pm for their game. Like people out in Cincinnati weren’t foaming at the mouth during their day games hoping their team could hold off the Giants. Everyone “has jobs.” Every city has “traffic.” How come Yankee fans are the only ones that let that stop them from supporting their team?
Now of course the rhetoric is that the Stadium is too expensive. The fans are so savvy they know this team isn’t a legitimate contender so why should they spend their hard earned money on expensive tickets. Give me a fucking break. Like you have to earn the Yankees fans approval in order for them to show up at the stadium because they’re so special. Take a fucking hike you jerk offs. You couldn’t even get excited for an elimination game in the Division Series. This team had one of the best records in baseball. If you can’t rally for them then you don’t deserve to root for this team. Forget about trying to get more of these fairweather assholes in the door, I wouldn’t even want them in the building. Lock them out. They do nothing but make things easier for the opposition.
So, Yankees fans – spin it however you want. You have jobs. New York City is crowded. The players are overpaid and don’t deserve your support. You can even play the “Yankees fans expectations” card. You’ve been here so often that you’re not even fazed by drama in the divisional rounds. You are so used to Game 7 heroics that Games 1 and 2 are just like midseason contests. Put your big bad arrogant Yankees spin on your pathetic fan base. Bottom line is guys like Quintin fucking Berry likes to come into your building now. You’re the spoiled corporate assholes who fill up half a stadium and spend the whole game hating your own players. The real Yankee Stadium died back in 2008 and with it died Yankees intimidation.",en,web
"Working with film, photography, illustration and sculpture, Mariana Caló & Francisco Queimadela have since March 2010 been developing an ongoing project entitled “Gradations of Time over a Plane”. Made up of non-sequential chapters, sitting independently from each other, but connecting in the context of the exhibition, these works explore different notions of time in relation to man and the land. Forming relationships with and then filming in various locations within remote regions in the north of Portugal, the Netherlands and in the city of Berlin, the artists seek to capture what they see as the temporal essence of different landscapes- certain visual and sensitive elements specific to each location. This field work is accompanied by extensive research into various popular, scientific and artistic perspectives on the relation between Man and the passing of time, de-constructing the documentation through the use of text, sound and elements of drawing and painting. The resulting works take the form of immersive installations that although constitute personal perspectives, seek to involve the viewer in the ongoing work, as free interpreters of the visual experience.
During their residency, Caló & Queimadela are continuing to research and develop the project, exploring the characteristics of locations in the UK, that might contribute to the project going forward.
In London, the artists have been developing two new chapters for “Gradations of Time over a Plane”. The first chapter, “Drifts and Derivations”, will premier at Gasworks during a temporary installation from 27 April 2012 until 29 April 2012. The second chapter will be shown at the Rowing Project Space from 22 June 2012 onwards. See the Rowing Project Space website for further details.
Please see the events section for a chance to see their work first hand.
Hailing originally from Viana do Castelo and Coimbra respectively, Mariana Caló & Francisco Queimadela live and work in Berlin. Their residency is supported by The Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation.
Mariana Caló and Francisco Queimadela have been exhibiting as a collective since 2008. Previous solo exhibitions include The Springs of the Flood (Chapter of Gradations of Time), Matador Projekt Raum, Berlin (2011), Gradations of Time over a Plane II & III, General Public, Berlin & Casa das Artes da Fundação Bissaya Barreto, Coimbra respectively (2011). Previous group exhibitions include Autofocus at General Public, Berlin (2011).",en,unknown

"Chinese domestic production of civil helicopters is set to grow, but not as quickly as the country’s authorities predict, according to a local market analyst. Matthieu Devoisselle, co-founder of Avia-Tek, a Shanghai-based aerospace consultancy firm specializing in emerging countries, regards government forecasts as unrealistic. But Chinese manufacturer Avicopter does have reason to be optimistic, he adds.
Aérospatiale Super Frelon
The Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) certified the country’s “new” home-grown heavy-lift helicopter on January 9. Built at state-owned Avic, the AC313 tips the scales at 27,600 pounds, can carry up to 27 people and has a maximum ferry range of 485 nm and a service ceiling near 28,000 feet. The AC313 appears to be an outgrowth of the 14,000-pound Chinese Zhi-8. That medium helicopter is based on the 1970s-vintage Aérospatiale SA321 Super Frelon.
Yesterday, the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) certified the country’s “new” homegrown heavy-lift helicopter, the AC313. It tips the scales at 27,600 pounds, can carry up to 27 people and has a maximum ferry range of 560 miles and service ceiling of nearly 28,000 feet. The helicopter was built by state-owned Avic, the same company that recently made Chinese-market Sikorsky S-76 airframes under contract.
China is expected to modify its low-altitude airspace restrictions over the
next few years, a move that could trigger demand for more than 1,000 new civil helicopters there over the next two decades. Part of its strategy for meeting that demand appears to be leveraging current and future relations with established Western helicopter manufacturers to build its own helicopter industry.
Last week China flew a new home-grown heavy-lift helicopter for the first time. The AC313 tips the scales at 27,600 pounds, can carry up to 27 people, has a maximum ferry range of 560 miles and was built at state-owned AVIC, the same company making Sikorsky S-76C++ airframes. The AC313 appears to be an outgrowth of the 14,000-pound Chinese Zhi-8. That medium helicopter is based on the 1970s-vintage Aérospatiale SA321 Super Frelon.
Safran’s helicopter subsidiary Turbomeca could be back in the contest to provide the powerplant for the Z15 helicopter following China’s recent decision to re-evaluate the engine. Late last year, executives with Eurocopter’s EC 175 program indicated that discussions are under way for the possible launch of a new engine for the Chinese version of the medium twin.
The People’s Republic of China (PRC) is generally seen as the next big market for the helicopter industry–OEMs, operators, training schools and maintenance operations alike. But can we expect the skies over China to be black with whirling blades any time soon?",en,reference
"By OGJ editors
HOUSTON, Dec. 29 -- France's Total SA discovered oil in shallow water near its producing Ofon oil field in southeastern OML 102 off southeastern Nigeria.
The Etisong-1 well went to TD 2,207 m in 70 m of water and tested more than 6,000 b/d of 40° gravity oil from turbiditic reservoirs.
The well is the first step in an exploration and appraisal program designed to demonstrate the feasibility of a new development pole on OML 102 that would combine production from the Etisong main discovery and as yet undrilled surrounding structures.
Total E&P Nigeria operates OML 102 with 40% interest, and Nigerian National Petroleum Corp. has 60%.
Total E&P Nigeria, already a large oil producer in Nigeria, plans to start production from Akpo deepwater oil field on OML 130 in early 2009. The company is undertaking development studies for Egina oil field on the same block.",en,web
"It is something every coach dreams about, but few achieve. It can mean the difference between winning a hockey game, a playoff series or even the Stanley Cup. It's the perfect line, and it usually consists of players with contrasting, yet complementary, talents. Chemistry and diversity are often more important than pure skill.
""You can't just put three skilled guys together and always expect it to work out,"" explains San Jose Sharks hockey analyst Drew Remenda. ""Often the real good lines have a combination of factors – toughness, power, speed, vision, skill – and it's the combination that works.""
Set lines were the standard 25 years ago, but they're a rarity in the modern game. The advent of video, the revolving door for coaches and the immediacy of winning have all led to frequent line juggling. A coach in the 1970s might have broken up his first line after five or six unproductive games, but today that same decision might be reached after five or six shifts.
""The game is so results oriented today,"" explains Nashville Predators Assistant General Manager Ray Shero, the son of Philadelphia Flyers coaching legend Fred Shero. ""Coaches are always concerned about players growing stale together, and if they're in a bit of a slump it may be more mental than anything else. So, switching the lines may get the players thinking a little more and trying to do different things on the ice.""
""In the mid-1970s, my father had three set lines (in Philadelphia),"" Shero said. ""He went with Reggie Leach-Bobby Clarke and Bill Barber; Ross Lonsberry-Rick MacLeish and Gary Dornhoefer; and Dave Schultz-Orest Kindrachuk and Don Saleski. My father's idea of switching things around to get the players more mentally into the game was putting the right winger on left wing and the left winger on right wing, or moving a defenseman up at forward. Nowadays, you're switching lines around all the time trying to find that right combination. With the access to video and satellite dishes, teams can really counter. (They can) get their desired defensive pairings or matches up front against your line, so you break up a line to try to counter that as well. You're always looking for that edge to win.""
The Vancouver Canucks have shown an edge to win in recent times and they have the depth chart to back up their ambition.
Vancouver is among the NHL's top teams in the excitement quotient and no combination is more deadly on a consistent basis than the line of Markus Naslund, Brendan Morrison and Todd Bertuzzi. The trio represent the premier line in hockey and gives proof to the concept that great lines come in all shapes and sizes.
Markus is entering the prime of his career and attributes much of his success to his linemates.
""This line has been together for a few years and they really click,"" explains Vancouver assistant coach Jack McIlhargey. ""They know each other very well, they blend together and they compliment each other. Todd Bertuzzi (6-foot-3, 235 pounds) is a real power forward, but he is a power forward with great skill. Todd has great hands in close and for a big man he's got great ability around the net. Brendan Morrison (5-11, 190 pounds) has great speed and is a playmaker. Markus Naslund (5-11, 195 pounds) loves to score. He is a natural goal scorer with a great shot and great release. He just loves to score.""
Scoring is something Naslund has done over 40 times in each of the last three seasons and he is on target for a banner year in 2003-04. The 30-year old winger is entering the prime of his career and attributes much of his success to his linemates.
""It's been a treat,"" says the Canucks' captain. ""Brendan is a very underrated centerman. He has great speed. I think that Todd is the premier power forward in the League. He opens up a lot (of ice) for his linemates. It's a great combination for myself.""
Like all great combinations, the Canucks' dynamic trio have the critical common denominator – speed.
""Speed makes things happen,"" says former NHL player and coach Terry Crisp, now the color commentator on Nashville Predators telecasts. ""When you consider great lines, at least one of the players has speed. They need good speed to open it up to make it happen.""
""Nobody knows what creates that chemistry, but you know when it's there."" -- Jerry Toppazzini
Great scoring trios are more than simply an assemblage of talented players. Sending out the most feared shooters and adept playmaker does not guarantee success. Every team has experienced frustration when they've combined three forwards with complimentary skills on paper, but were unable to make a smooth transition on the ice. The formula for developing a dynamic line is not a simple one. Some believe that it has yet to be discovered.
""There’s no sense sitting down and trying to analyze it,"" says Crisp. ""You can't analyze it and you can't videotape it. Why? Because it’s a God-given talent right off the bat. Certain guys are given the talent and they can utilize it together.""
So what factors enable three players like Naslund, Morrison and Bertuzzi to mesh their skills and dominate from the opening faceoff?
""If I could answer that question I'd go out scouting players and starting putting them together,"" says Jerry Toppazzini, a hard-driving winger with the Boston Bruins in the 1950s. ""I don't understand why I played better with Fleming Mackell and Don McKenny than I did with other players on my team. I don't know what made Jean Beliveau, Bernie Geoffrion and Bert Olmstead click. I have no idea. Nobody knows what creates that chemistry, but you know when it's there.""
And in Vancouver, it's there.",en,books
"Authorities cleared the scene without incident after an hour and half, recommending that the Stanislaus County District Attorney's Office file charges against the man for brandishing a firearm, rather than arresting him on the spot.
At about 2:30 p.m. Wednesday, two bail bondsmen were attempting to arrest the man living at the hotel, at 7115 McCracken Road, because he had outstanding misdemeanor warrants from outside the county, Stanislaus County Sheriff's spokesman Royjindar Singh said. The bondsmen broke a window to the man's hotel room and attempted to enter when the man greeted them with a handgun, he said.
The bail bondsmen then retreated and called 9-1-1, Singh said.
Police scanner traffic to the deputies indicated the man was a former weapons instructor with the military. Singh said dispatchers received that information from the bondsmen.
Deputies with the sheriff’s department and Patterson Police Services walked around the hotel and used their cars as shields as they positioned themselves around the building. California Highway Patrol officers also were on hand to assist if matters became more tense.
Deputies attempted to get the man to come out of the room, but he would not, Singh said.
Because the warrants did not call for extradition and the man had no previous felony warrants, he was not arrested, and police cleared the scene at about 4 p.m., Singh said. The DA's office will handle the matter from this point forward, he said.

"Sir Gregory Ander
Sir Gregory Ander was born and bred in Queensland, within view of Hartleigh Castle. Born to middling nobles of Alderclass, Gregory was the last of six boys. His elder brothers followed in their father’s footsteps as advocates at Queen Maelys’s Court, but Gregory always sought something a bit more exciting than pushing paper and defending the ruffians in the streets of Hartleigh City.
When he was sixteen, Gregory’s father arranged for him to be accepted into one of the knighting orders, the Order of the Oak, upon the death of Gregory’s closest brother, Bram. The Order of the Oak was not the initial choice of the family, for the Order of the Rose–being the Queen’s personal guard–have a great deal more prestige. Regardless, once initiated, Gregory had little say unless the Queen changed her mind or promoted him elsewhere.
Gregory, being both crafty and handsome, quickly rose through the ranks, and was granted full knightship on the even of his twentieth birthday. He was conspicuously late to his knighting, however, having been spotted with a noblewoman some time before. What a messenger knight was doing in the company of such a woman was certainly up for speculation.
It was two weeks later that the very same noblewoman was discovered dead in her apartment. While Sir Ander was no where near the woman’s abode at the time, and therefore could not have been involved directly–so the advocates from his family argued at court–he was acquitted of all charges. The advocates on behalf of the woman’s family, Fortesque & Nob, filed an official complaint after the trial, but it was quickly thrown out by the High Counselor herself, having noted that a decision was made and the law would be upheld.
As a messenger knight, Sir Ander is frequently dispatched up and down the Continent, and sometimes across the sea and into the Isles, as well. While his fellow knights are extremely loyal to him, and have only the most glowing comments to make on his behalf, some will tell you different. If you visit some of the seedier establishments in the Territories, for instance, not a few Innkeepers will tell you about the fresh-faced Oaksguard with a penchant for roughing up their girls.
Sir Ander is a man of contradictions. He is young, but jaded; clever, but arrogant; passionate, but cruel–he loves the attentions of women, but cannot stand their company.
When Sir Ander walked into the Territories towns to collect Alderclass girls on an errand from the Queen, he used her writ as absolute law, reportedly threatening violence should the towns not cooperate and hand over their young women. And it is rumored that what violence was seen was due to his command, though it has officially been blamed on an interruption by the Order of the Asp.
Profile: Sir Gregory Ander

- Eye Color: Dark brown

- Hobbies: A collector of “ancient” weaponry, as well as books on the subject. Is known to have a particularly dedicated interest in the use of torture in war times.

“I think he’s pretty close,” says Boudreau when queried as to Morrisonn’s status. “We’ll see [Friday] or the next day. [It will be a] game-time decision type thing.”
Boudreau also believes that Fedorov is almost healthy enough to play again.
“He said he was feeling better,” says Boudreau. “We kept him off the ice today; he’ll probably be on the ice [Friday]. When we were in Carolina they skated pretty hard. That’s why he’s getting an extra day’s rest [Thursday].”

NYLANDER TO HAWKS?
Rumors abound that the Blackhawks are closing in on a deal with the Capitals to acquire ex-Bruin forward Michael Nylander, 36, who also played here for a couple of seasons. With so many young players in the Blackhawks lineup, Nylander's veteran presence would help. Nylander missed half of last season because of injury, but has been healthy from the start this season, collecting two goals and 9 points . . .
Those rumors don't go away... Even Ted Leonsis lately said in his blog that goaltending is an issue and Bulin is a proven veteran... I don't think Caps will go after Huet after what has happened in the summer...
Update from Capitals Insider:
Michael Nylander, who has only one assist in his past seven games, will be a healthy scratch tonight. Jose Theodore will start in goal and likely face Scott Clemmensen. Sergei Fedorov is also out, as is Shaone Morrisonn.
Corey Masisak reports that Fedorov and Morrison are skating for the first time...

"(WASHINGTON)– Congressman Allen West (R-FL) met with representatives from the Internal Revenue Service this week to discuss solutions to the growing number of taxpayer identity fraud cases in South Florida. Federal Trade Commission reports show tax-related identity fraud continues to plague the United States, most notably South Florida, where more than half of the 20,000 Florida identity fraud cases to the IRS have been detected.
“It has become too easy and far too common for criminals to obtain the taxpayer identification numbers of people and file fraudulently in their name,” West said. “Today’s meeting with the IRS allowed me to hear directly from the agency as to what investigators are doing to prevent this crime. I challenge the IRS to determine a more efficient system for tracking who these criminals are and how they are obtaining taxpayer identification numbers.”
IRS leaders discussed with Congressman West several new systems implemented this year to identify and track fraud, including a “detection code” assigned to suspicious filings.
“I can assure you, we are getting better everyday,” Jodi Patterson, Director of Return Integrity with the IRS, told Congressman West. ”This is a top priority for the IRS.”
Patterson also assured Congressman West the IRS is improving its system for how operators handle taxpayers who believe their identity has been stolen.
“We have spent a great deal of time training our operators on how to interact and best help expedite the reporting process, ” Patterson said.
West asked the IRS to report back to him at the end of April on improvements the IRS has made over last year, including a report of indicators and warnings the IRS has discovered through its investigation. West also encouraged the IRS to work with local law enforcement to better track down criminals on a local level.
“Our local law enforcement is well aware of this problem and they want to be involved,” West said. ”I am confident the IRS is listening to our concerns and will continue tracking down these criminals until this problem is solved.”

According to WENN.com, Simon was among the mourners at the Lordship Community Church, where he performed Soto's favorite song ""The Sounds of Silence."" Simon knows the Soto family through his sister-in-law, according to the New York Daily News. Soto is being called a hero for attempting to shield her students from the gunfire before she was killed.",en,web

"This is another favourite treat during Chinese New Year. The texture of these mini puffs are supposed to be crispy and crunchy from what I could remember. However not having made them before, I tried out this recipe from one of my Chinese cookbooks, and they turned out to be soft crunchy and not very crispy. Although I don’t mind them that much as they are still quite delicious, I would prefer to find a recipe that will produce the light crispiness too. Maybe I need to reduce the amount of eggs, and increase the lard/oil proportion for the pastry… Anyway here’s the recipe for those of you who like this kind of texture.
Makes approx. 70 puffs (5cm-size)
300g (2 cups) plain flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
70g (4 tablespoons) caster sugar
80g (4 tablespoons) lard, or canola oil if preferred
2 eggs, lightly beaten
Filling (enough for about 90 puffs):
140g (1 cup) Ground Peanut Filling
12g (1 tablespoon) plain flour
40g (2 tablespoons) smooth peanut butter, or Chinese sesame paste
Put the plain flour on a piece of kitchen paper and microwave on HIGH for 1 minute. Remove and transfer the flour to a new sheet of kitchen paper. Return to microwave and cook on HIGH for another minute. Sift the flour and add all other ingredients. Mix together to form a slightly sticky filling.
1. Put flour, salt and sugar into a mixing bowl. Add lard or oil and rub into the flour mixture until it resembles breadcrumbs.
2. Add beaten eggs and knead lightly into a smooth dough. Wrap the dough in cling film and set aside for about 30 minutes; put into the refrigerator in hot weather.
3. Divide dough into 4 portions; work on one portion at a time and keep the other portions well wrapped to prevent drying out. Roll dough out to about 3mm thick. Use a 5cm round cutter, cut out rounds of pastry. (Alternatively, use the mouth of a glass, about 7cm diameter, to cut out rounds to make slightly larger puffs.)
4. Place 1/2 teaspoon of filling into the centre of each pastry round (use 1 teaspoon filling for the larger 7cm pastry rounds). Fold the pastry over to half-moon shape to enclose the filling and seal by crimping the edges into rope shape. (Or use the turnover mould to make the puffs.) Arrange the pastry on a lined baking sheet. Repeat with remaining dough pieces and filling.
I put an egg in there as a cpmparison to the size of the puffs; the 3 lower left puffs are 7cm in size with the 7cm turnover mould shown, the rest are 5cm puffs.
5. Deep-fry the pastry puffs until golden brown.
Taste: Crunchy puffs with delicious peanut filling
Consume: Best within 1-2 weeks
Storage: Store in airtight containers

"Environmental policy, renewable energy, and demand response
The gradual recognition of the impact that emissions from electric generating plants have had on climate has driven unprecedented changes in environmental policy and regulation, as well as the rapid development of renewable energy generation and demand response and energy efficiency programs. These technological changes are widely viewed as the most environmentally benign technologies available to satisfy existing and new demand for electricity. Responding to these changes—and the uncertainty about the nature and scope of future regulations—requires a thorough understanding of complex interactions across markets, the development of appropriate business and compliance strategies, and the accurate assessment of the costs and benefits of the deployment of these new energy supply technologies.
Bates White’s experts bring decades of professional experience, constant monitoring of trends, and continued involvement in the latest developments to take on the issues faced by clients. We combine deep economic and technical expertise with the necessary analytical rigor to provide clients with the ability to see the “big picture.” The selected engagements described below highlight the depth and breadth of our work, as well as our ability to apply state-of-the-art methodologies and analysis tools to the challenges of “greening” the energy sector.
Government and industry concerns and conflicts over the environmental impacts of energy resource development have resulted in new environmental regulations and increased litigation. These concerns are exacerbated by greater uncertainty about the nature and scope of future regulation. These trends, which show no signs of abating, complicate the task of developing appropriate business and compliance strategies. Bates White’s experts understand and are able to explain the morass that is today’s global environmental policy so that our clients can make rational and supportable economic and operational decisions. The services we provide include:
- Expert consulting and testifying services
- Policy design
- Cost-benefit analysis
- Emissions trading
- Water rights and supply analysis
- Environmental compliance strategies
- Permitting and EIS support
- Catastrophic risk analysis
- Economic impact studies
For more information about the approaches, methodologies, and models used by Bates White in the analysis of environmental policy, download our environmental policy brochure.
Renewable electricity is the fastest growing segment of the electric generation market, and as such, it provides significant investment opportunities. Generation investors, utilities, lenders, insurers, and energy regulators all seek to maximize their gain from these opportunities. Bates White helps assess the risks that attend this booming industry, including market and operational risks related to future power prices, changes in weather, transmission access and pricing, and prices of capital equipment and feed stocks; the technological risks inherent in generation technologies that continue to evolve and mature; engineering risks associated with the impacts of variable-output technologies (like wind power) on transmission system stability; and the regulatory risks associated with changes in state and federal incentive policies, cost recovery methods, and cost allocation.
Bates White’s experts have the practical knowledge and analytical tools to:
- Forecast the hourly production of solar thermal and photovoltaic generation using engineering models
- Forecast transmission system congestion and locational marginal prices that help establish the viability of renewable generation
- Simulate large, integrated transmission markets to estimate asset performance and value
- Evaluate the effects and costs of integrating variable-output renewable technologies on transmission system stability and reliability
- Prepare and deliver expert testimony and regulatory support on transmission cost allocation, rate of return, and pricing policies
The following engagements illustrate the breadth of our experience in the assessment of renewable energy generation:
- Conducted detailed valuation analysis of Allegheny Hydro plants for New York State Electric & Gas Corporation (NYSEG) in support of settlement negotiations with plant owners. The analysis considered the value to NYSEG of assuming ownership under expected default by owners under existing PPA.
- Developed a GIS-based project siting methodology for utility-scale solar PV plants that considers the location of transmission/subtransmission infrastructure along with other known siting constraints, including county land-use plans, utility and conservation easements, environmentally-sensitive areas and critical habitats, state and national parks, and military bases. Parcel ownership level data helped the developer expedite project land acquisition.
- Advised the developer of a 500-MW wind project in northern Baja California, México on the technical, commercial, and regulatory aspects of interconnection and new transmission infrastructure for export to California. Facilitated certification as an in-state resource by the California Energy Commission and performed comparative analysis of environmental and other siting regulations in the United States and México.
- For a leading PV manufacturer, estimated and compared the levelized cost of electricity produced by thin-film solar photovoltaic (PV) and solar thermal parabolic trough generating facilities. To this end, our experts developed bottom-up component and system-level cost estimates for solar PV and CSP facilities and forecasted the cost escalation for supply constrained and specialized materials and components used in these plants. Hourly production simulations of the plants were performed using a customized application of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s Solar Advisory Model, a detailed engineering model of solar generation technologies.
For more information about the approach, data, and models used by Bates White in the analysis of renewable energy, download our brochure on renewable energy services.
The following engagements illustrate the breadth of our experience in the area of demand response and energy efficiency:
- Performed a market assessment of energy efficiency technologies and combined heat and power for industries in the California/Baja California cross-border region for the CEC. Designed an innovative market research framework using field surveys (and other resources) and GIS techniques to collect and deliver market data that enabled US technology and project development companies to better target potential customers. To improve survey response rates, our experts arranged survey collaborations with key industrial chambers of the three major cities and the Baja California State Government.
- Bates White econometricians modeled a utility’s inverted block rate structure and estimated electricity demand elasticities for various levels of customer income and electric end-use appliance holdings. Elasticity estimates such as these are essential for estimating the impact of dynamic pricing programs or conducting cost-benefit analyses of price-based energy efficiency programs. However, most publicly available elasticity estimates are from an era in which appliances, demand response technologies, and electricity prices differed greatly from those we see today. The results of the analysis were introduced in testimony by an affiliated expert studying the impact of proposed changes in the utility’s rate structure on low-income customers.
- On behalf of the AIM Foundation, our experts evaluated the benefit-cost assessment methodologies for energy efficiency (EE) programs in Massachusetts. Bates White evaluated existing assessment methods and program implementation, as well as proposals to substantially expand EE programs funded through mandatory electricity surcharges. In addition, implications for cost effectiveness of the EE programs and economic impacts on Massachusetts business were assessed.
- Our experts possess more than 30 years of experience in the estimation of demand response and of customer choice regarding participation in demand response programs. One of our experts was instrumental in the design and implementation of many of the early two-part, real-time pricing programs in the United States. She led the analysis of the demand response for many of these programs, as well as the analysis of Pool Price Contracts in the early days of the UK competitive power market. The results of these analyses were used to integrate demand response into utility commitment and dispatch algorithms, to evaluate program impact, and to develop menus of products designed to transition to competition. More recent work has included assessing the need to update prior demand response analyses to account for changed technology, market structures, prices, and institutional imperatives; review of the status of advanced metering infrastructure in California, New York, and Ontario for the Australian regulatory body; and advice to the Electric Power Research Institute on the incorporation of demand response in risk management programs.
- Testified before the New York Public Service Commission on the inadequacy of energy efficiency and demand-response programs as fully equivalent alternatives to a proposed 190-mile HVDC New York Regional Interconnect, Inc. (NYRI) transmission line. The testimony was introduced in proceedings for the application for a Certificate of Environmental Compatibility and Public Need for the proposed line.",en,reference

"Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer to Address Democratic National Convention Tonight
CHARLOTTE, NC – Tonight at approximately 8:00 P.M. ET, House Democratic Whip Steny H. Hoyer (MD) will address the Democratic National Convention. The following is a transcript of his speech, as prepared for delivery:
“I’m proud to be here tonight to support President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden for a second term.
“President Obama has spent the last four years seeking the solutions we need to meet our challenges. He has spent his first term focused on building a strong economy and growing the middle class. Thanks to his leadership, America’s auto workers are back on the job, and manufacturers are hiring at levels not seen since the 1990s. But we need to do more.
“That’s why President Obama wants to revitalize the manufacturing sector that made our nation great. House Democrats share that vision, which is why we have a plan called “Make It In America” to invest in out-educating, out-innovating, and out-building our competitors overseas. A strong America depends on a successful and growing middle class, and this election is a moment of truth for middle-class families.
“The choice we have to make this fall is a critical one – but I don’t believe it’s a difficult one.
“Last week, Mr. Romney said he wished President Obama had succeeded when he took office.
“If so, he was alone in his party.
“Let’s review the history.
“Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the Senate, said that Republicans’ number one priority was the defeat of President Obama. Not the defeat of terrorism, not the creation of jobs, not the reduction of our deficit and debt, not ensuring access to health care, not educating our children. But to simply defeat our President.
“As the Rev. Jesse Jackson describes it, they want to drown the captain, and they’re prepared to sink the ship to do so.
“For four years, Republicans in Congress have pursued a strategy of confrontation, refusal to compromise, and obstruction.
“That’s why not a single House Republican voted for the law that brought our economy back from the brink. That’s why President Obama’s jobs plan was not even put to a vote in the House. Instead of trying to fix the problem, the Republicans unfortunately played politics.
“But despite historic levels of obstruction, President Obama was able to bring the economy back from the verge of a second Great Depression. In January 2009, when the President took office, our economy lost more than 800,000 jobs. This July, the economy added 172,000 jobs, the 29th consecutive month of private sector job gains. We know that’s not enough, but it’s a turnaround of nearly one million jobs from when President Obama took office. We’re better off.
“These past four years, while President Obama was fighting for the middle class, Mitt Romney, Paul Ryan, and their Tea Party allies cared more about tearing down the President than building up America. They’re hoping that we will forget that.
“They’re also hoping that we will forget their role in piling up a mountain of debt being left to our children and grandchildren.
“My friend Paul Ryan talks about fiscal responsibility, but voted to put two wars on a credit card. He voted to spend trillions of dollars on tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires. He voted for a prescription drug benefit with no plan to pay for it. He abandoned the bipartisan principle that we must pay for what we buy. And he voted against the balanced deficit reduction plan produced by a bipartisan commission – a fact he didn’t tell you in his speech last week.
“He also didn’t tell you that Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan want to end the Medicare guarantee and turn it into a voucher, which would leave seniors with the increased costs.
“He also didn’t tell you that President Obama has strengthened Medicare by taking away big subsidies to insurance companies and by tackling waste, fraud and abuse. That President Obama has saved seniors more than $4 billion on prescription drugs by closing the ‘donut hole,’ and that President Obama added years to the life of Medicare.
“Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan promise hard truths. But they don’t deliver hard answers or real solutions.
“President Obama and Democrats are working tirelessly to move our country forward over the near unanimous opposition of Republican leaders, and Republican Members of Congress.
“The decision we have to make this November is simple: do we keep moving forward, or do we join the ‘Romney-Ryan retreat’ and go back to the same failed policies of the past.
“Barack Obama and Joe Biden have been working hard to help middle-class families ‘make it’ in America.
“Let’s send them back to the White House with a Democratic House and Senate ready to get to work. Ready to make tough choices. Ready to meet our challenges head-on.
“We must not flag or fail. We must keep moving forward, restoring faith in the American dream. Let’s re-elect President Obama and Vice President Biden!”",en,media

"Here in New England we have had an insane amount of snow this winter. INSANE. You may have seen some of my Wordless Wednesday posts showcasing over 3 feet of snow. I lost track of how many snowstorms we had between Christmas and the end of January, but it was out of control and a state record. I don't like the cold and I don't like the snow. But what I like least of all is being trapped inside the house with 4 rambunctious boys all winter long.
Yes we went out and played in the snow a lot, when my little guy was napping. But he is still too young for me to bring him out there, so we only went out in short increments. They will run around for a bit inside and play with their toys, but this gets boring quickly or eventually leads to fighting and someone hurting someone else. I even started letting the twins play Wii with their big brother, figuring it was some activity and better than just sitting on their bums all day. Bu these are not enough, we need more options.
Some of the snow has started to melt, thankfully. But we still have a good foot on the ground and unfortunately, it has turned into a solid sheet of ice. So no more playing on that. I am out of ideas. I've thought about bringing them to an indoor play space, there are plenty around here, but those cost money and I have 4 kids.
So I need your help. If you live in an area with cold, snow filled winters, what do you to keep the kids busy and active till it thaws outside? Do you have fun indoor activities that they like to do? Are there days when your throw them in the car and take them to the mall just to get them out of the house? How do you survive the winter?",en,web

"Poland has been lost for seventh time but at least both of my Aryan and Arab fiances are together in the heart of Europe, Brussels. While they shall be happy together in some other place. In my beloved Dobrzyca palace that was in time of both French and American revolutions a center of the Freemasonry.
Before the wars and the Holocaust, my family possessed more that 100 palaces and other properties. With the land area that is two times bigger that modern state of Israel. All this goods has been unlawfully nationalized by Jozef Stalin in 1945-53 and never returned to the heir of the family and Jewish nation.
However, this Dobrzyca palace - is very special for me, my family and the nation. It has been builded by Prince Jozef Tadeusz Radziwill (aka. General Agustyn Gorzenski), as the fruit of the French Revolution and has became his beloved place on the earth. “This litte corner on the earth is nicer that all other places” - General Gorzenski has put, as the motto behind the main entrancement. And in this I also did not changed even by single yota.
In 1988 on the edge of collapse - Soviet Poland - like in many of other palaces, has opened there a museum dedicated to my family. Gathering many historical artifacts and rare paintings. To this day, in capitalism, it is not Prince Radziwill and his fiances that lives there but some unknown person - the State Treasure.
The vistors can buy a ticket and watch how we was living in the past, while rightful owner of not only Holy Land is literally dying like a dog under the fence. Like french dog, to be precise. Do not be then surprised my Israeli if i will simply sell my land to your enemies. You has already proved that you are useless for the Lord and the proof that you want to provide, will be your final one.
In this context moving Ms. Sienkiewicz from Copenhagen to Belgium was maybe steep in right direction. But what we are observing there is just a nonsense. She must be provided an abortion, if you want to buy more time. It is stricly two weeks time-frame that cannot be extended. You has set up this clock - by raping her.
This hard and painful story can still have a happy end: “They has lived a long and happy lives in the House of the Lord - Dobrzyca palace”. However, it is a happy end that can be also achieved, in the longer perspective, without you and your fallen state, too. While the right solution - abortion - is at one’s fingerprints.
However, better don’t do it like you did with France. If any of this ladies will be execute, in response I will exclude you on paper from any further talks on participation in the Holocaust heritage. As my Final Act can be delivered to many different channels - giving a military, political, economical and even criminal plagues. That can be scaled flexibly…

"Awards include 79 We the People projects in U.S. history and culture
WASHINGTON (May 31, 2007)–The National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) today announced that 118 successful applicants will receive a total of $17.5 million in grants and offers of matching funds for projects designed to advance humanities research and prepare scholarly editions, provide high quality public programming on television and in libraries, support projects in U.S. history and culture offered by state humanities councils, preserve and stabilize significant humanities collections, and support long-term plans for strengthening humanities programming at cultural institutions.
Seventy-nine of the successful grants announced today are designated as We the People projects, a special recognition by the NEH for model projects that advance the study, teaching, and understanding of American history and culture.
“Put simply, the humanities teach us what it means to be human—and today’s NEH grant recipients are illuminating the human condition through rigorous scholarly research, vital efforts to preserve our cultural heritage, and innovative public programs that engage our minds and deepen our understanding of human history,” said NEH Chairman Bruce Cole. “With these grants, NEH continues its support of wide-ranging and substantial projects that explore the great ideas and great events of both our own culture and other cultures throughout the world.”
In this award cycle, scholars and institutions in 39 states and the District of Columbia received support from the NEH. A complete state-by-state listing of grants and offers is available in three Adobe PDF files, located in the box above. [Some of the projects cited in this release and included in the linked files have received an offer of an award; in such cases, the exact dollar amount and duration may be subject to change.] The 118 new NEH grants and matching offers come from six of the Endowment’s major program areas—challenge grants; education programs; federal/state partnership; preservation and access; public programs; and research programs—with examples of each:
- NEH Challenge Grants are offered only when NEH funds will make a significant improvement in humanities programs, help institutions carry out long-term plans for strengthening their basic resources and activities in the humanities, and enhance financial stability through increased nonfederal support. First-time recipients of NEH Challenge Grants, which must raise non-federal funds on a 3-to-1 matching basis, include the Fayetteville Public Library Foundation in Arkansas, Historic Cherry Hill in Albany, N.Y., and the National Yiddish Book Center in Amherst, Mass.
- Education Programs, as part of the agency’s new Digital Humanities Initiative, made the first two awards for Digital Humanities Workshops for School Teachers, which are designed to offer K-12 teachers intensive professional development workshops where they can deepen their knowledge, understanding, and skill in using digital resources in their humanities classrooms. Columbia University in New York will conduct workshops in New York, Florida, and Texas that draw upon the digital resources of “Asia for Educators” to explore topics in early modern China; the Gilder Lehrman Institute of American History, also in New York, will conduct a workshop for 30 school teachers focused on digital resources on the American revolution and the Civil War.
- Federal/State Partnership awards include 20 We the People projects, each sponsored by a state humanities council to explore significant events and themes in American history and culture. For example, Colorado Humanities in Denver will hold Chautauqua presentations in Greely and Grand Junction and solicit grant proposals to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the New Deal; the Georgia Humanities Council in Atlanta will conduct reading and discussion programs in Georgia communities and develop resource and training materials to accompany a touring exhibition, “Key Ingredients: America by Food”; the Indiana Humanities Council in Indianapolis will conduct a series of conversations on topics in American history and culture to strengthen civic engagement in Indiana and will create Web-based packets of resources for teachers that correspond to four of the state’s high school history standards; and the New Hampshire Humanities Council in Concord will provide a statewide speakers bureau program and provide grants for community projects on topics in American history and culture.
- Preservation and Access stabilization grants assist cultural institutions in their efforts to preserve significant humanities collections by supporting improved housing and storage, environmental conditions, security, lighting, and fire protection. For example, the Museum of New Mexico in Santa Fe will relocate and rehouse its historical collections that document four centuries of regional history from Spanish Colonial times to the present; the University of Florida’s Museum of Natural History will reorganize and rehouse archaeological collections from Pineland, the largest site of the now extinct Calusa Indians; and the Spertus College of Judaica in Chicago will rehouse and relocate material culture, library, and archival collections related to the history and culture of Jewish communities throughout the world.
- Public programs awards promote lifelong learning in the humanities for broad public audiences and support projects that go beyond the presentation of factual information to encourage thought and conversation about humanities ideas and questions. This new round of awards includes 23 awards of $1,000 each to libraries throughout the nation to support a traveling exhibition, Lewis and Clark and the Indian Country. Additional awards will support the planning, scripting, and production of documentary films on humanities topics for television. For example, NEH awarded television production grants to the Educational Broadcasting Corporation in New York for production of a two-part documentary film series about art and culture in Paris between 1905 and 1930, the Western New York Public Broadcasting Association in Buffalo for a two-hour television documentary on the War of 1812, and Twin Cities Public Television in St. Paul, Minn., for a 90-minute television documentary on the life and career of Dolley Madison.
- Research awards include NEH grants and offers for collaborative research projects and scholarly editions. Collaborative research encompasses a variety of activities, including research conferences, translation of humanities documents and textual materials into English, and field archaeology. New awards include ones to Timothy Wengert of the Lutheran Theological Seminary at Philadelphia, who will prepare an English edition of the correspondence of Heinrich Muhlenberg, the patriarch of American Lutheranism, and John Walsh of Indiana University in Bloomington, who will develop new digital tools for searching and manipulating Isaac Newton’s 2,000 pages of writings on alchemy. NEH will support scholarly editions projects by Paul Israel of Rutgers University in New Brunswick, N.J., on the Papers of Thomas Alva Edison, Diana Buchwald of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena on the Collected Papers of Albert Einstein, and John C. Stagg of the University of Virginia in Charlottesville for the Papers of James Madison.

"The Lucille Lortel Awards, for achievement Off Broadway, were announced today. Leading the pack with multiple nominations are Observe the Sons of Ulster Marching Towards the Somme, Frank McGuiness’ World War I drama, produced by Lincoln Center Theatre; Avenue Q, the satirical musical featuring a mixed cast of humans and puppets, produced by Vineyard Theatre; and the Signature Theatre revival of Lanford Wilson’s Fifth of July. In the design categories, multiple nominations were earned by Observe the Sons of Ulster… and Avenue Q, as well as Moliere’s Don Juan, currently revived by Theatre for a New Audience at the Lucille Lortel Theatre.
In the lighting design category, five LDs were cited. Christopher Akerlind was doubly nominated, for both the scenery and lighting of Don Juan. Howell Binkley was nominated for his work on the flop musical Radiant Baby, about the life of downtown artist Keith Haring; Radiant Baby was also nominated for outstanding musical. The always-busy Donald Holder was singled out for Observe the Sons of Ulster Marching Towards the Somme. James F. Ingalls was nominated for his work on My Life With Albertine, a musical based on an excerpt from Proust’s Remembrance of Things Past; the show was almost universally panned but the design was highly praised. James Vermeulen earned a nod for his colorful sunsets and sunrises on Fifth of July, although one might argue that he did far more creative work on Our Lady of 121st Street, which earned four nominations in other categories.

"Mexican America - Introduction
""Mexican America"" is a sampling of objects from the collections of the National Museum of American History. The stories behind these objects reflect the history of the Mexican presence in the United States. They illustrate a fundamentally American story about the centuries-old encounter between distinct (yet sometimes overlapping) communities that have coexisted but also clashed over land, culture, and livelihood.
Who, where, and what is Mexico? Over time, the definitions and boundaries of Mexico have changed. The Aztec Empire and the area where Náhautl was spoken—today the region surrounding modern Mexico City—was known as Mexico. For 300 years, the Spanish colonizers renamed it New Spain.
When Mexico was reborn in 1821 as a sovereign nation, its borders stretched from California to Guatemala. It was a huge and ancient land of ethnically, linguistically, and economically diverse regions that struggled for national unity. Texas, (then part of the Mexican state of Coahuila y Tejas) was a frontier region far from the dense cities and fertile valleys of central Mexico, a place where immigrants were recruited from the United States. The immigrants in turn declared the Mexican territory an independent republic in 1836 (later a U.S. state), making the state the first cauldron of Mexican American culture. By 1853, the government of Mexico, the weaker neighbor of an expansionist United States, had lost what are today the states of California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, and parts of Colorado and Wyoming. In spite of the imposition of a new border, the historical and living presence of Spaniards, Mexicans, indigenous peoples, and their mixed descendants remained a defining force in the creation of the American West.
“La América Mexicana” es una muestra conformada por objetos provenientes de las distintas colecciones del Museo Nacional de Historia Americana. Estos objetos reflejan la historia de la presencia mexicana en los Estados Unidos e ilustran una crónica fundamentalmente americana acerca del encuentro centenario entre comunidades diferentes que han coexistido, pero que también se han enfrentado, en la pugna por la tierra, la cultura y el sustento.
¿Quién, dónde y qué es México? Con el transcurso del tiempo, las definiciones y los límites de México han ido cambiando. Se conocía como México al Imperio Azteca y toda el área donde se hablaba náhuatl —actualmente la región circundante a la ciudad de México. Durante 300 años los colonizadores españoles se refirieron a ella como Nueva España. Cuando en 1821 México resurgió como una nación soberana, sus fronteras se extendían desde California a Guatemala. En ese entonces era un antiguo e inmenso territorio conformado por regiones étnica, lingüística y económicamente diversas que luchaban por adquirir unidad nacional. Texas (en ese entonces parte de los estados mexicanos de Coahuila y Tejas) era una región fronteriza lejos de las densas urbes y de los fértiles valles de México central, donde se reclutaban inmigrantes de los Estados Unidos. En el año 1836 este territorio mexicano se declaró como república independiente (y más tarde, estado de EE.UU.), convirtiéndose en el primer calderón de la cultura mexicoamericana. Hacia 1853, el gobierno de México, el vecino débil de un Estados Unidos en expansión, había perdido el territorio de los actuales estados de California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, Nuevo México, Texas y partes de Colorado y Wyoming. A pesar de la imposición de un nuevo límite fronterizo, la presencia histórica y ocupacional de los españoles, mexicanos y pueblos indígenas, junto a sus descendientes mestizos, constituiría a lo largo del tiempo una influencia determinante para el desarrollo del Oeste Americano.
""Mexican America - Introduction"" showing 1 items.
- This print depicts American forces attacking the fortress palace of Chapultepec on Sept. 13th, 1847. General Winfield Scott, in the lower left on a white horse, led the southern division of the U.S. Army that successfully captured Mexico City during the Mexican American War. The outcome of American victory was the loss of Mexico's northern territories, from California to New Mexico, by the terms set in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. It should be noted that the two countries ratified different versions of the same peace treaty, with the United States ultimately eliminating provisions for honoring the land titles of its newly absorbed Mexican citizens. Despite notable opposition to the war from Americans like Abraham Lincoln, John Quincy Adams, and Henry David Thoreau, the Mexican-American War proved hugely popular. The United States' victory boosted American patriotism and the country's belief in Manifest Destiny.
- This large chromolithograph was first distributed in 1848 by Nathaniel Currier of Currier and Ives, who served as the ""sole agent."" The lithographers, Sarony & Major of New York (1846-1857) copied it from a painting by ""Walker."" Unfortunately, the current location of original painting is unknown, however, when the print was made the original painting was owned by a Captain B. S. Roberts of the Mounted Rifles. The original artist has previously been attributed to William Aiken Walker as well as to Henry A. Walke. William Aiken Walker (ca 1838-1921) of Charleston did indeed do work for Currier and Ives, though not until the 1880's and he would have only have been only 10 years old when this print was copyrighted. Henry Walke (1808/9-1896) was a naval combat artist during the Mexican American War who also worked with Sarony & Major and is best known for his Naval Portfolio.
- Most likely the original painting was done by James Walker (1819-1889) who created the ""Battle of Chapultepec"" 1857-1862 for the U.S. Capitol. This image differs from the painting commissioned for the U. S. Capitol by depicting the troops in regimented battle lines with General Scott in a more prominent position in the foreground. James Walker was living in Mexico City at the outbreak of the Mexican War and joined the American forces as an interpreter. He was attached to General Worth's staff and was present at the battles of Contreras, Churubusco, and Chapultepec. The original painting's owner, Captain Roberts was assigned General Winfield Scott to assist Walker with recreating the details of the battle of Chapultepec. When the painting was complete, Roberts purchased the painting. By 1848, James Walker had returned to New York and had a studio in New York City in the same neighborhood as the print's distributor Nathaniel Currier as well as the lithographer's Napoleon Sarony and Henry B. Major.
- This popular lithograph was one of several published to visually document the war while engaging the imagination of the public. Created prior to photography, these prints were meant to inform the public, while generally eliminating the portrayal of the more gory details. Historians have been able to use at least some prints of the Mexican War for study and to corroborate with the traditional literary forms of documentation. As an eyewitness, Walker could claim accuracy of detail within the narrative in his painting. The battle is presented in the grand, historic, heroic style with the brutality of war not portrayed. The print depiction is quite large for a chromo of the period. In creating the chromolithographic interpretation of the painting, Sarony & Major used at least four large stones to produce the print ""in colours,"" making the most of their use of color. They also defined each figure with precision by outlining each in black. This print was considered by expert/collector Harry T. Peters as one of the finest ever produced by Sarony & Major.

"BUYINS.NET: Market Maker Surveillance Report. SNV, INTC, KEY, F, ACTC, AMBS, Highest Net Sell Volume and Negative Price Friction For Tuesday, January 8th 2013
(M2 PressWIRE Via Acquire Media NewsEdge) BUYINS.NET / www.buyins.net, announced today its proprietary Market Maker Friction Factor Report for Tuesday. Since October 2008 market makers are now required to be on the bid as much as they are on the offer and for like amounts of stock. This Fair Market Making Requirement is designed to prevent market makers from manipulating stock prices. On Tuesday there were 3949 companies with ""abnormal"" market making, 2552 companies with positive Friction Factors and 2778 companies with negative Friction Factors. Here is a list of the top companies with the highest net sell volume on Tuesday and lowest negative price Friction (bearish). This means that there was more selling than buying in the stocks and their stock prices dropped faster with less Friction. Synovus Financial Corp (NYSE:SNV), INTEL CORPORATION (NASDAQ:INTC), KeyCorp (NYSE:KEY), Ford Motor Co (NYSE:F), Advanced Cell Technology Inc (OTCBB:ACTC), Amarantus BioSciences Inc (OTC:AMBS). To access Friction Factor, Naked Short Data and SqueezeTrigger Prices on all stocks please visit http://www.buyins.net .
Market Maker Friction Factor is shown in the chart below:
Symbol Change Percent Buy Volume Buy %% Sell Volume Sell %% Net Volume Friction
SNV $-0.110 -4.06% 5,047,040 28.12% 8,194,182 45.65% -3,147,142 -286,104
INTC $-0.160 -0.74% 21,440,928 44.32% 25,378,059 52.45% -3,937,131 -246,071
KEY $-0.010 -0.10% 9,165,542 25.80% 17,243,469 48.54% -8,077,927 -8,077,927
F $-0.080 -0.60% 14,325,533 30.98% 16,683,310 36.08% -2,357,777 -294,722
ACTC $-0.010 -8.79% 20,434,418 44.34% 25,647,263 55.66% -5,212,845 -5,212,845
AMBS $-0.010 -6.99% 7,136,737 42.61% 9,611,937 57.39% -2,475,200 -2,475,200
Analysis of the Friction Factor chart above shows that each of the six stocks mentioned above have low price friction combined with more selling than buying (negative Net Volume) in their stocks. The Friction Factor displays how many more shares of buying than selling are required to move a stock higher by one cent or how many more shares of selling than buying moves a stock lower by 1 cent.
For example, the chart above shows SNV down $-0.11000 with a Friction Factor of -286,104 and a Net Volume of -3,147,142. That means that it takes 286,104 more shares of selling than buying to drop SNV by one penny. On Monday the Market Makers allowed the stock to move down on heavier selling than buying (low negative friction).

Jul 1, 2006 12:00 AM
Following the recent release of QuarkXPress 7, graphic arts managers and other technology decisionmakers are asking two primary questions:
Quark has revamped its previously troubled color management system with some success. There are four fundamental changes:
Command central for QuarkXPress 7’s color management is
the Color Manager, located in Preferences. Whether it is good to
always have color management on can (and will be) argued both ways.
For savvy production color users, it’s probably a good thing,
as ultimately it forces us to make color decisions that we should
be making anyway. For those with limited color experience, the
quality and consequences of the QuarkXPress 7 default settings will
determine the output results. Learn how to config-ure the source
and output settings (Edit menu) and apply them through the Color
Manager (Preferences) and/or the Job Jackets Manager (more on this
The source/output setting separation is a welcome change. Users can control specifically which color profiles and rendering intents will be used for viewing and converting the color in your images. For many this will involve using the same profiles and intents used elsewhere, such as in Adobe Photoshop. You also have access to the same color system-stored profiles as those accessed in Photoshop, as well as the Quark-specific profiles stored in Quark’s application folder. If you pay attention, you should be able to keep your color consistent as you move your images through QuarkXPress.
For those of you anxiously wondering about using your previous color settings that you know how to print, breathe easy. You can select QuarkXPress Emulate Legacy for your source and Output settings, and ColorSync or ICM for your color management module (CMM), if you want to just pass the old values through. The most obvious opening for color divergence is if you convert colors through QuarkXPress using a CMM different than one you use elsewhere.
The third major color management change is Quark’s
adoption of LogoSync CMM. The CMM is the engine that actually
handles the conversion of the color values from one color profile
space to another color profile space. Using LogoSync is an overall
improvement, but it has built-in limitations, as well. Switching
from OS-based ColorSync or ICM to LogoSync (for the default CMM) is
a good move for two reasons. First, using LogoSync provides more
cross-platform compatibility not available when ColorSync was used
on the Mac. Second, ICM is used in Windows. The limitations of both
ColorSync and ICM are widely acknowledged, so other CMMs have been
adopted widely. LogoSync (developed with GretagMacbeth) is an
acknowledged high quality CMM. The inherent limitation of using
LogoSync is that it currently is not widely used. In print
production the most widely used CMM is the Adobe (ACE) CMM. There
are those who argue LogoSync is a better CMM than Adobe (ACE) CMM.
Even if this is true, it is largely irrelevant to the discussion of
consistency. And there is little Quark can do about this, as it
does not have access to the Adobe (ACE) CMM. So until either Adobe
releases its Adobe (ACE) CMM for third-party use or another CMM
(such as LogoSync) becomes the commonly used standard, this
inconsistency in color conversion will exist. How visible the
differences in the conversion results will be will depend upon the
images, color profiles and rendering intents used.
Bypass color conversion problems by performing the conversions in another application (such as Adobe Photoshop) and assigning the same color profiles for Source and Output in QuarkXPress that you have in Photoshop.
The other major change—a good oneis the ability to soft proof nondestructively using color profiles and rendering intents. Quark’s soft proofing is similar to InDesign’s soft proofing with a View menu Output Control. Also like InDesign, QuarkXPress now lets users view and change image-specific color profile and rendering intent via Window > Profile information.
So what’s the bottom line? Here are my conclusions:
One caveat: This .psd import capability doesn’t seem to work well with layers modified by Photoshop CS2 Layer Styles. When I imported a CS2 .psd image containing layer styles, I consistently received an error message indicating that layer effects were not supported. But when this occurred, the .psd image still was imported and access and editing still was provided to those layers and channel components that were supported. (Perhaps the PSD Import feature was developed and tested with CS1 images.)
Picture effects provide for a variety of picture editing tools, including curves, sharpening, blurring and many more. Once applied, these effects adjustments can be stored and reused. I remain a staunch supporter of making these corrections directly in an image editing application such as Photoshop. Nonetheless, this could be a time-saving production tool when working with client files whose images all need the same amount of lightening or sharpening. You could apply the effect once, record that adjustment and then apply it to as many other images as are required.
You even can share picture effects files. InDesign does not offer a similaralry powerful image-editing tool. Picture Effects currently does not work with Photoshop images, a frustrating mismatch with the .psd import function.
Keyboard shortcuts are a mixed bag. QuarkXPress historically has provided the more logical and elegant keyboard shortcut sets and sequences. Its use of the “M” series as well as its control of type size, tracking, kerning and leading still is the best around. But InDesign now offers a custom dialog (Edit > Keyboard Shortcuts) that allows you to assign your own keyboard shortcuts, reassign others, create sets of shortcuts and even use QuarkXPress and PageMaker shortcuts. Quark still has the fundamentally superior set of shortcuts, but it is resting on its laurels. InDesign offers an increasing number of shortcuts common to multiple CS applications, so it’s a tie in this category.
Measurements palette vs. control palette
The enhanced measurements palette is the most immediately obvious interface change in QuarkXPress 7. It has a new context-sensitive pop-up subpalette that offers many of the control features previously found only in other dialogs and palettes.
This is Quark’s answer to InDesign’s multifaceted control palettes.The new measurement palette is well designed and easier to decipher than InDesign’s implementation of a context-sensitive palette. If you just don’t like any of this context-sensitive sophistication, click on the Quark logo icon on the far left of the pop-up palette, and you will see your familiar old measurement palette.
Master pages, style sheets, text import and
No important changes have been made to master pages or style sheets in version 7. InDesign remains master of those realms.
In addition, InDesign offers multiple baseline grids (through text frame baselines) and boasts a complete and sophisticated Word document import feature for controlling the import, autoformatting and appending of style sheets from Word and .rtf documents, which QuarkXPress still lacks.
Output styles vs. print presets
Quark has one-upped Adobe in the print styles category, where Quark’s print style was roughly equivalent to InDesign’s Print Presets. QuarkXPress’ new output style (Edit > Output Styles) is like print styles on steroids—it includes resolution-specific transparency flattening, metadata and JDF info, as well as standard print dialog settings.
Output styles have three initial default setups for PDF, Print and EPS (whose settings now include the ability to embed font files in EPS files). Output styles can be shared and are integrated into the powerful job jackets function, as well.
QuarkXPress 7 has stuck with JAWS as its PDF Export function. While Quark has done extensive testing with the new and improved version of JAWS, I remain unconvinced of the consistent usability of JAWS-generated PDFs in prepress. (Besides, it is slower than molasses flowing in January.) I still recommend printing PostScript from QuarkXPress to Distiller-watched folders for generating prepress-bound PDFs. Again Adobe has an inherent advantage, because it owns PDF and Distiller. Quark does provide an easy and Preference-selectable avenue to PostScript and Distiller.
One of Quark’s most comprehensive and sophisticated new production tools is the implementation of job jackets, including the Job Jackets Manager (Utilities > Job Jackets Manager). Job jackets are complete descriptions of all—and I mean ALL—the characteristics of a job. Jobs can be defined at three levels:
Once defined, job jackets can be used in multiple ways. A job
jacket can be used to create a new job using all the predefined
characteristics of that job jacket (File > New > Project From
Ticket). Job jackets also can be used to evaluate an existing job
(File > Job Jacket > Evaluate Layout). This job evaluation
amounts to a sophisticated preflighting tool that allows you to
look for a wide range of intimate project and component
characteristics, such as image resolution, file format, image color
space and attached color profiles. QuarkXPress documents also can
be output using job jackets or tickets. Instead of selecting File
> Print, you can choose to define and control your output via
the job jacket by selecting File > Output Job, selecting a
specific set of output specifications defined in a ticket template,
including previously created output styles. InDesign doesn’t
offer this powerful production tool.
Now for a reality check: The good news is that the job jacket function is robust, full-featured and highly integrated into QuarkXPress 7; the bad news is that the job jacket function has a complex and somewhat quirky (non-QuarkXPress-like) interface that is difficult to learn. I see this function initially being configured by print shop techies who will then train larger clients to use them.
The bottom line
If you are a QuarkXPress user, I think you will be delighted with version 7 and I recommend upgrading. Keep a copy of 6.5 available, too. I also recommend installing QuarkXPress 7 first on a test system partition or drive identical to your working system, as a precaution, to ensure the installation process does not cause any unexpected system problems. The bottom line: QuarkXPress 7 is a welcome update with some very powerful new tools and features.
Talk to the hand
Whenever I am working in QuarkXPress, I love that I don’t have to remember which of the two keyboard shortcuts I am supposed to use (depending upon whether I am working with an active text tool or not) for accessing the hand tool.
If I were king of Adobe, that is the first thing I would fix: One keyboard shortcut for accessing the hand tool! Then, while I was at it, I would change the names of the two selection tools to “object” and “content” tools.
So long to PostScript?
By Julie Shaffer
The Adobe PDF Print Engine is a new printing platform (a.k.a. RIP) that directly renders PDF files. Many print/prepress workflow solutions on the market today are based on Adobe CPSI RIP technology, which is built on PostScript. Even solutions that use PDF as an internal working file format, such as Kodak Prinergy, Agfa Apogee and Heidelberg PrintReady, still convert those PDF files to PostScript prior to actual imaging.
But PostScript 3 was introduced in 1997. It can’t natively render some newer effects, like transparency, which have become design mainstays. Transparency has to be flattened prior to introducing it to PostScript and, depending on how and where this flattening is done, the results can look terrible. Adobe’s PDF Print Engine eliminates all such problems because it renders those PDF files natively.
The technology also incorporates JDF information for job control, so it will fit nicely into the “end-to-end” workflow solutions.
Adobe still will support PostScript—it won’t suddenly vanish. But the next evolution is here.

From NPF press releases
BANDITS DOWN RACERS
Chicago Bandits’ pitcher Eileen Canney (1-2) came out in the circle today with unfinished business. The last time she faced off with the Racers, she started and had a great game, giving up just one run and three hits in six innings.
The Bandits would go on to lose the game in extra innings after Canney was pulled.
Today, was a different story with the Bandits (14-8) coming out on top 8-0. Canney would surrender just four hits in seven innings of work. The Racers (12-10) would not put more than two runners on the bases for the game—both hits coming in the sixth inning off two singles from Jessica Vallis and Crystl Bustos.
Bustos’ hit struck Canney straight in the knee, but the tenacious pitcher would tough it out to finish the game.
The Bandits bats were out and cracking again today as they recorded 12 hits and handed Racers’ pitcher Lisa Norris (8-1) her first loss of the season.
Bandits’ centerfielder Emily Friedman was especially active today, going 3 for 4 at the plate with a home run in the second and a single and RBI double. Angela Findlay was right behind her, adding two more RBI to her record, as well as a double and solo home run.
After Friedman’s homer in the second, the Bandits continued to dominate offensively, plating three runners with an error and Friedman’s double to left field.
The Bandits ended with a bang in the sixth inning, racking up five consecutive hits, three singles and two doubles to hammer the nail into the coffin for the Racers and end the game with a final score of 8-0.
Today’s win secures the series for Bandits at 3-1, a far different cry from the other two series against Akron, which the Bandits lost 2-1 and 3-1 respectively. It also puts the Bandits in first place in the league at a 14-8 record.
The Bandits will be heading to Nashville for a five game series against the Tennessee Diamonds beginning on Wednesday, July 14.
PRIDE SHUTS DOWN DIAMONDS 7-0
NASHVILLE, Tenn. (July 11, 2010) _ A three-run blast by Melissa Roth in the fifth inning was the big hit of the day at the USSSA Pride beat the Tennessee Diamonds 7-0
The Diamonds ended a two-game winning streak with the loss Sunday afternoon, but still managed to win the series 3-2, the first time they have won a series this season. Despite the heat 206 fans were on hand at Draper Diamond on the campus of Lipscomb University.
The Pride scored two runs in the fourth, three runs in the fifth and two in the sixth.
In the fourth the Pride capitalized on an infield single by Megan Willis coupled with a throwing error to first base by pitcher Becca Heteniak. Tonya Callahan, who had singled with one out, and Amber Flores, who walked, both scored on the play.
Roth’s home run accounted for all three runs in the fifth. Lauren Lappin walked to start off the inning and Caitlin Lowe was hit by a pitch to set the stage for the homer.
In the sixth a single through the right side by Caitlin Lowe drove in two runs for the Pride. Flores led off the inning with a double to left. Willis reached on an infield hit to the shortstop. Charlotte Morgan entered the game as a pinch-hitter and walked. Flores and Willis scored on the single by Lowe.
Right-hander Sarah Pauley, 6-2, threw a complete game for the Pride. She gave up five hits, walked three and struck out six.
Heteniak, 0-2, pitched four innings for the Diamonds. She allowed three hits and four runs, two earned. She walked three and struck out two.
Right-hander Kristen Erb relieved Heteniak in the fifth. In 1.1 innings she scatted four hits and gave up three runs. She walked one and struck out run. Right-hander Samantha Sheeley closed out the game. She gave up one hit in 1.2 innings.
The Diamonds will take a couple of days off and resume play at home Wednesday night at 4 when the Chicago Bandits, led by Jenny Finch, visit Draper Diamond for a doubleheader.",en,reference

"Although I try to keep it a secret, I LOVE fried food. Going gluten free has helped to squelch this addiction, because a lot of fried food has wheat flour or other forms of gluten in it. That’s why I like dishes like this. They become juuust close enough to being fried that I can’t get enough of them, but they are also pretty guilt free. Butternut squash is pretty good for you and as you can see from the recipe list, there aren’t too many other ingredients! The spices add a nice twist with the sweet-ish squash; the end flavor is a perfect mix of sweet and savory!
Spicy Butternut Squash ‘Meat’balls
2 cups cooked butternut squash
2 tbsp cooking oil (your preference)
1/2 tsp coriander powder
1/4 tsp turmeric powder
1/4 tsp lemon juice
2 tsp cumin seeds
1/2 tsp sea salt
1/4 cup millet flour
Mash together the cooked butternut squash in a medium mixing bowl until it’s smooth. In a separate small mixing bowl, whip up the eggs for about a minute, then add into the mashed butternut squash. Add the lemon juice, coriander and turmeric powder, cumin seeds, and sea salt. The millet flour should be added slowly to achieve the texture you want. I added it one tablespoon at a time and ended up using approximately 1/4 cup total. At this amount, the flavor wasn’t overpowering – you could barely taste it. Also, I think it you add too much more than that, the texture would be too dry.
Add the oil to the pan and drop the batter in. I used a tablespoon measure to scoop out the batter (they were heaping though, so more in quantity than a tablespoon). Any size would do though. I think next time I will spread them out a little thinner and wider to make ‘burgers’!

"Aquaman: Geoff Johns, Ivan Reis, Joe Prado, Jonathan Glapion, Andy Lanning, Rod Reis, Nick J. Napolitano
The story continues as Manta hunts for the relics, and Aquaman does everything he can to stay hot on his trail. Last issue, Manta had escaped Aquaman and appeared before Mera and Dr. Shin…hinting that Shin’s possibly been the one aiding and working with Manta.
This issue starts off 6 years ago, before all the Others had their relics. Aquaman leads them into a tomb on an island where the Dead King of Atlantis, the man who built the city originally, had laid all the weapons he had forged, the relics. They each take them - and it seems like they’re taking them because Manta wants them. We still don’t know what brought the Others together as a group in the first place. But I have a feeling we’ll find out.
The Operative tells Arthur and the others that Manta’s heading for the island where the tomb lies, and Arthur says he’ll go alone in order to protect the Others, because the reason Manta went after them all is because Arthur killed his father. So, apparently, this is personal for everyone. Apparently Manta did something to each of them. Sounds like him, and I dig that each of them is bound together by this common enemy.
Hang on, just wait a minute, everyone. Am I still the only one who thinks Vostok looks like Ocean Master? Vostok even takes off his super helmet, and his black hair and beard make it even MORE obvious to me! I did a little research on the name, and it just turns out that he’s named after an actual Russian spaceflight program, which is fitting. Alright, back to your scheduled program.
Manta takes Shin to the island to find ANOTHER relic, a seventh relic. One that’s apparently more powerful than Arthur’s trident. Now, hang on. Arthur’s trident is being used to compare the power of the relics? Surely it’s not the most powerful…it doesn’t do anything. It doesn’t shoot blasts or anything - that we’ve seen so far - and it definitely doesn’t TELEPORT you around the world. Surely the globe, or the bracelets, or even the seeing-the-future trinket is considered more powerful than just a trident.
Perhaps there’s more to this thing that we haven’t seen yet.
This whole issue is filled with beautiful art. Good lord, I can never get enough from this team. Ivan’s pencils are excellent, and detailed as always. Look at that last splash page, the backgrounds. The set. Same with the beginning. It looks so Tomb Raider, and I’m digging it a lot. More than that, Rod’s coloring work is phenomenal. Why he’s not nominated or receiving every single coloring award ever offered is a true mystery to me.
I could list off several examples of why his work is masterful in this issue alone, but I won’t. The work speaks for itself, and is gorgeous. I go through this title twice, once to read the story, and another time just to stare at the artwork.
Aquaman #11, the verdict: Not only is every single issue just a treasure to behold, with the fantastic art team pulling out all stops to bring us such dazzling visuals, but the story is developing into something really incredible. I feel like the villain is ahead, and is powerful. The heroes are lagging behind, and don’t possess the power to win. It’s exciting. It’s engaging. It makes me excited for the next issue. Everyone is all inter-related in terms of history, and it makes for a rich set of characters. We barely know anything about certain of these “Others,” but we’re still able to go along with it and root for them because of the experience they share that comes off of the page so well. If you’re not reading Aquaman, well, there’s just no hope for you.

Many of us (I being one of them) consider that LF may be one of the last frontiers

VHF. In Microwave, most experiments may have to do with using either old Navy or

Bizzel – see Short Paper #1
Graff/Leff – “Revisionist Historiography” (2005)
- As Graff/Leff provide their meta-history of revisionist historiography, they fall into the same trap as their predecessors in comments like “…Charles Sears Baldwin established the standard pattern for twentieth-century studies of the history of rhetoric” and “[Carole Blair’s] essay ‘Contested Histories of Rhetoric: The Politics of Preservation, Progress, and Change’ represents the last major entry in the wave of revisionism…” because they never explain how they’re coming to these conclusions.
- Oddly, when discussing the new scholarship that has emerged in com/rhet since the first wave, the authors do acknowledge that they do not “have space in this chapter to review all of the different perspectives featured in the early stages of the discussion but can identify some of the basic tenets as well as characteristic assumptions and motives animating the broader revisionist projects within the field of composition-rhetoric.” Again, no real discussion here about how these “basic tenets” were generalized. To what degree, then, do historians need to be explicit about who/what they’re including/excluding and their reasons for doing so? As an outsider (someone just now learning about this discourse community), it seems that the risk in not being explicit is unchecked canonization of certain authors – more on this below.
- In outlining a chronology of first and second wave revisionists, are Graff and Leff contributing to the traditional view of history as a linear enterprise and in turn, canonizing certain historiographers and theorists (names that I now recognize as important)? We have more taxonomies (“critical historiography”). Interesting to have read this after Octlog and after last week’s readings. How would I have framed those authors if I had read Graff/Leff’s account of them first?
- What’s also suspect is Graff/Leff’s four-page interrogation of Carole Blair. Seems like she being used for a set up, though it’s difficult to tell without knowing more about revisionist approaches. I also wonder if she is attacked because of some disciplinary distortion – as the authors admit, her speech background “contrasts sharply” with comp/rhet’s.
- Argument for why we should look at pedagogy moves a bit quickly for me, though I like their suggestion to study the pedagogy of rhetoric since teaching is my most viable and rewarding reason to study histories of rhetoric (as opposed to other ways of viewing it, which so far seem more interested in its philosophical, textual, and therefore abstract consequences).
Carol Mattingly’s “Telling Evidence: Rethinking What Counts in Rhetoric” (2002)
- Agrees with Bizzell that more needs to be done to “explore the broad range of texts that can contribute a vibrant understanding and appreciation of women’s role in rhetoric.”
- Outlines early recovery efforts and uses the example of Cady Stanton and Anthony to argue that this early work has been guilty of canonizing certain women rhetors (admittedly, to establish ethos) at the expense of ignoring other important ones. The problem is that those canonized “become deeply imbedded in our cultural narratives,” initially chosen from rhetorical criteria “established in the masculine tradition.”
- By reading a wide range of primary sources, Mattingly discovered that more women were more publicly active as rhetors in the 19th century than scholars initially thought. A resistance to study women outside of the suffrage movement (i.e. women in the temperance movement) prevented scholars from coming to this understanding sooner and is the result of not reading locally (contextually) enough – an argument made by several of Mattingly’s contemporaries (so-called second wave revisionists) – since contemporary scholars have equated temperance with conservativism. More focused study, she argues, opens up possibilities for more interpretations. Without this additional work, she implies, she would have never discovered that Amelia Bloomer was more influential than Anthony or Cady Stanton or that the temperance movement was really a call for better conditions for women.
- In arguing for a more accurate understanding of rhetorical traditions Mattingly ultimately wants scholars to rethink the ways they measure rhetoric by redefining evidence. “Since traditional definition of rhetoric have been constructed around notions of masculine rhetoric,” she argues, “many rhetorically sophisticated women simply do not fit neatly into the rhetorical tradition. What has counted for evidence fails to recognize women’s excellence.” Mattingly’s example is women’s clothing in the 19th century played an essential role in establishing ethos, though we wouldn’t consider that if we went with the traditional measures of rhetoric.
Karlyn Kohrs Campbell’s “Consciousness-Raising: Linking Theory, Criticism, and Practice” (2002)
- Campbell’s overarching argument can be captured in her pithy quote in the intro: “as a form of discursive practice, consciousness-raising is the thread that links the recovery of texts, their recuperation through criticism, and the extraction of theoretical principles that underlie women’s ways of persuading.”
- She begins by tracing a few ways women’s histories have been recovered, even before the U.S. woman’s rights movement, from speeches in the 19th century to dissertations in the 1930s through the 1950s to the emergence of women’s studies programs to new anthologies of women’s histories. She acknowledges, however, that no matter what historians try to do, “the historical record will remain profoundly distorted, skewed toward those lucky enough to be literate, educated, and middle or upper class and whose works appeared in mainstream outlets with wider circulation.”
- In the spirit of recovery, Campbell then analyzes how women’s rhetoric and its history have been “lost” in the first place – or how certain obstacles and criticisms (“formal prohibitions,” “denial of agency,” “unsexing,” “attacks on character,” “aesthetic”) are fixed by traditional rhetoric to make it impossible to analyze justly.
- In order to overcome these obstacles – and to protest them – women spoke or wrote in ways that both met traditional expectations of the rhetor “while incorporating stylistic elements that projected femininity” such as inductive structures, narrating personal experience, dialogism, etc. According to Campbell, these alternative rhetorics can only be recuperated through critical analysis.
- Barrowing from Krista Radcliff’s efforts to theorize from analyses, Campbell argues that feminist critical analysis of the discursive practices that are recovered should be used to extract larger rhetorical theories: “the task of recovery is unending; recuperation, however, requires the analytical and interpretive work of critics.” It’s not clear to me, though, how these all link together. What would these new theories do? How might they help with current issues facing feminism? How might they help historiography of rhetoric?
Christine Mason Sutherland’s “Feminist Historiography: Research Methods in Rhetoric” (2002)
- She starts by comparing how she learned to conduct historical research to how she learned to write – it just became second nature – which doesn’t seem to be very self-reflective. Her privileged background reinforces this for me.
- The article is feminist in that it’s autobiographical – the most personal we’ve read so far – yet sometimes I can’t help but feel she abuses the notion by not discussing evidence enough. She brings up multiple issues but tends to dismisses them and move on (postmodernism being one of the biggies).
- Agrees with Enos that more attention needs to be paid to primary texts since interpreting them makes her “feel more like a benefactor” than “taking the adversarial stance typical of so much secondary research.” This really provoked me – I never thought of this distinction and the idea that primary research could be considered a “feminist” move is powerful. I’m surprised more attention wasn’t paid to it. Instead she makes grander claims about the trouble with argumentive discourse.
- Notes that she sides with “the authority of the writer, and the importance of seeing the text in the historical context,” which, she argues, characterizes traditional scholarship. But many feminists and scholars (who’d probably be calssified as po-mo) agree that all historical scholarship needs to be localized. I thought Campbell made a more nuanced argument in this regard and that Sutherland gets confused because she tries to claim too much.",en,academic
"Arkansas' State Senate on Tuesday rebuffed the governor's veto of a controversial bill that would make abortions illegal after 12 weeks of pregnancy, voting to override his decision on what would be the most restrictive ban on the procedure nationwide.
Beebe has called the legislation ""blatantly"" unconstitutional and said it would ""impose a ban on a woman's right to choose an elective, nontherapeutic abortion well before viability,"" the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported.
The Arkansas House must still vote to complete the override, the newspaper reported.
The state already has one of the most restrictive abortion laws in the U.S. after the Republican-led Legislature last week overrode Beebe's veto of a similar bill that set the legal abortion threshold at 20 weeks' gestation — two to four weeks earlier than most states.
That law took effect immediately but, if the House also overrides the governor's veto, the new measure wouldn't take effect until 90 days after the Legislature adjourns later this month or in early April.
The American Civil Liberties Union of Arkansas has already said it would sue if the 12-week law goes into effect.",en,web
"This is the approximate sound made on board a US submarine as it rises toward the surface, or engaged in a full dive. I’ve made few appearances lately, either here or in person at a lot of events, and I wanted to say a little bit about what I’ve been up to.
I’ve been changing things over at the Boy Scouts. Shaking them up a bit, maybe. Getting shook up, a lot. I’ve given them a lot more of my time this summer than I meant to, and it’s taken its toll. The chapel service this week was the best we’ve had all summer, but it was also the least well-attended; I find myself wondering if word is getting around that I’m not doing a specifically Christian service, or worse. I learned half-a-dozen new plants in the first two weeks of camp, but since then it’s been nothing. I taught one group of boy scouts to recognize a couple of edible wild plants — so they harvested all of them and brought them to their troop to sample. Now they’re gone from camp, despite my warnings that they should not harvest ALL of them.
These are the same people who get angry at me for balancing rocks. It’s not OK to balance rocks in public places within sight of a man-made lake, but it is OK to harvest every single sample of an edible wild species despite an instructor’s warnings to the contrary??
Last summer, the food was terrible and I lost weight. The new cook is good, but for all the walking and exercise I’ve been getting, I’ve not been losing weight, I’ve been gaining.
A week from Saturday, and I’ll be on a plane to Colorado Springs, CO, for ten days of USFA coaches’ college. You can tell me who to see and what poetry events to check out in Colorado Springs, but frankly, I don’t think I’m going to have the time.
I have a new writing assignment from folks down in GA. Haven’t seen a contract, don’t know what I’m supposed to get paid — tempted to pass on the contract for an August in the cockpit of my kayak.
Still haven’t finished the July New Moon sonnet, and a couple of other poems, and feeling really ticked off about that. Getting hints from school that in the wake of a colleague’s departure, that there’s all sorts of new work for me to do, and not much in the way of compensation or recognition — need to be better about saying, “this doesn’t work for me.”
A lot doesn’t seem to be working for me. I lost my wallet this July, lost two checks, lost my ID, lost a lot of time, lost a lot of time with friends, lost a lot of time on my own with a notebook and a pen, and with Leah.",en,books

"R.I.P. Cedar Tree
What do you do if you are a Prince and your favourite tree dies? You have a memorial pavilion built around the stump to start with.... Prince Charles' 200 year old Cedar of Lebanon tree was 60 feet high and was a stunning focal point for his house and garden at his organic farm at Highgrove. Sadly, the tree developed a fungus and had to be felled. The answer to what to do was given to an environmental architect who specialises in ecological buildings. There was a young oak tree already growing by the stump so the architect, Mark Hoare, wanted to create a design that would surround the remnant of the trunk and allow the new oak to grow. The wood from the dead tree was full of knots and couldn't be recycled but he dismantled the tree carefully and furniture can be made of the old wood.
The new building is made from oak from the farm's woodland. The bottom part is covered with oak roof tiles and has a hole for the new tree to grow through and another one where the one remaining bough of the tree remains--temporarily. Apparently the Prince has a collection of oriental bird feeders and they will hang from it. The spire is 32 feet high and mirrors a neighbouring church spire. There are openings for birds to nest and alight. In time the bough will die and the oak tree will take its place. So the whole structure is organic in its own right. :: The Telegraph",en,web

Not wanting to blow my own trumpet but the best bit on this ubber cool film from Al Lee is mine and Ian’s Patagonia Winter instalment, due primarily to the fact there’s no climbing on it!
I think Al is one of the most talented climbing film makers, and in Patagonia winter this highlighted as he takes hours of footage where nothing happens, a minute when something does*, and a bunch of great photos, and produces what Yvon Chuinard described as one of the best climbing films ever.
Patagonia winter stands out as a testament to Al’s skill as a film maker, and the simple humour of two climbers on the edge of a nervous breakdown",en,media

"Below, I essentially replicate his results with the purpose of trying to reproduce them in a way that is a little easier for mere mortals like myself to digest. Instead of showing the entire distribution, I use mean values for each group. Razib concludes:
The general qualitative result: American conservative Protestants are in the main to the center or social liberal end of Muslim public opinion. They are not comparable at all to Muslim reactionaries.As the averages make clearer, conservative Protestants (defined here as those who expressed a preference for the Republican party) are in fact more liberal on each of these issues than Muslims in any of the countries included are. Keep in mind, the comparison here is between conservative Protestants and all Muslims, not just between evangelicals and reactionary Islamists. The latter comparison would show conservative Protestants to be even more liberal relative to Muslims than this comparison does.
Finally, using standard deviation values reported in the WVS, each of the tables also shows where the average conservative Protestant fits into the Muslim distribution*. So, on the question of the justifiability of homosexuality, the average conservative American Protestant is at 71st percentile of the Muslim population. Because the wife-beating question is inverted, the figure shows where the average conservative Protestant falls on the another-black-eye-to-explain-to-the-neighbors-is-unjustifiable distribution. The higher the value (on a 1-10 scale), the more justifiable the act or behavior in question is viewed as being:
|Conservative Protestants (US)||3.2|
|Conservative Protestant percentile among Muslims||71st percentile|
|Conservative Protestants (US)||3.5|
|Conservative Protestant percentile among Muslims||73rd percentile|
|Man to beat his wife||Score|
|Conservative Protestants (US)||1.3|
|Conservative Protestant percentile among Muslims||63rd percentile|
WVS variables used: V185, V231(Republican), V202, V204, V208
* Arrived at by simply averaging the averages of each of the Muslim groups on each question. This skews Muslim opinion towards that of the Middle East and North Africa and away from South Asia, which, in terms of sheer numbers, is unrepresentative of the world's roughly 1.6 billion Muslims. Indonesia, Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh all have far more Muslims than any of the MENA countries do, but with the exception of Pakistan, when Americans think of Muslims, they primarily have Arabs and Persians in mind.",en,academic

"""The annual Lincolnshire Environmental Awards would not be possible without the generous support of our sponsors"" commented chairman of the Lincolnshire Environmental Awards and Lindum Rotary Club member, Roger Pavey.
""We are delighted to have their support, especially following last year when we were unable to secure sufficient sponsorship to run the full award scheme.""
Lincolnshire Environmental Awards 2011
» Best Business Award supported by Anglian Water
» Best Community Award supported by Centrica Energy
» Best Farm / Rural Enterprise Award supported by Brown & Co
» Young Environmentalist Award supported by Waste Recycling Group (WRG)
Andrew Brown, Climate Change and Environmental Performance Manager at Anglian Water, said: ""Anglian Water knows high quality water starts with a healthy environment. We also know our dry, low-lying region is vulnerable to the effects of climate change. That’s why commitments to drive down the carbon released by our operations are at the heart of our new Love Every Drop manifesto, which will guide the way we do business in the future. So we are delighted to sponsor these awards, which celebrate the fact there are many businesses and individuals in Lincolnshire who are working to protect our shared environment.""
Centrica Energy are pleased to be sponsoring the Community Award. Alice Gill, Stakeholder Communications Manager said ""it is important to recognise the great work that community groups doing in their local areas improving habitats and protecting wildlife, essentially improving the environment for us all.""
Fay Parker, a member of Brown and Co’s Agricultural Business Consultancy Team who specifically specialises in providing environmental advice to farming businesses throughout Lincolnshire said: ""Brown and Co are very honoured to have been asked to sponsor this event. Obviously we witness, in the line of our business, some of the exceptional environmental work carried out by our Lincolnshire farmers for the benefit of everyone. It is quite right that some recognition should be given to those who have excelled in this particular field and hopefully this award goes some way in providing that recognition. The county is certainly a better place as a result of their efforts.""
Entries to the award scheme are welcome from organisations, groups, businesses and schools in Lincolnshire, North Lincolnshire and North-East Lincolnshire. The deadline for entries is 30 April 2011. Finalists will be invited to present their entries on Thursday 30 June 2011 to the final judging panel led by Professor David Bellamy before the award presentation at a gala dinner at the Bentley Hotel in Lincoln that evening.

"This is not an attack.
This is a response.
I woke up at 4 o’clock in the morning thinking about you, Geraldine.
I lay there listening to my sorta-beagles snore and wondered if you really think that Senator Obama is still in this race solely because he is a black man.
I don’t know you, Geraldine, and I don’t assume a person is decent simply because they hold a certain status in the Democratic Party and feminist history. This bitch has never met you, but I sure as shit know what it is like to have someone attribute my success to my being black.
It’s the freakiest mind fuck out there to have someone treat what has been the source of oppression like it is the “it” benefit of 2008.
But you know that, don’t you…Geraldine?
And it is a sadly powerful attack that dismisses all the hard work; the years spent biting your tongue, the ass whoopings you chose to hold back and the cussing outs that never happened even though not telling someone about themselves almost caused you physical pain.
""If Obama was a white man, he would not be in this position,"" Ferraro said. ""And if he was a woman (of any color) he would not be in this position. He happens to be very lucky to be who he is. And the country is caught up in the concept.""
Which I translate to mean that you, Geraldine, think Alan Keyes just had bad timing.
Let’s get real, Geraldine. You don’t give a flying shit whether you offend the hell out of some people as long as your message gets through to the right people. The kind of people who hear a quote like that and are thankful that someone said it…fucking cheer when they hear it then eagerly e-mail it to five friends…and can’t believe you’re catching hell for it.
…who you need to fire up and are confident the tried and true fuel of 'gender trumps race' will get it done and bring in some money.
This trifling ass shit has left me unable to imagine a scenario where I cast the vote people risked their lives and died to achieve for me for a candidate who's campaign insults what I stand for and the principles I believe in.
This has been so fucking not nice.
And next time don’t bother with the “and if he was a woman (of any color)” pander, okay?
I haven’t been caught up in that unified sisterhood concept yet, honey...and your verbal malfunction didn’t help with that shit one bit.
I’m not attacking you because you are white.
This is coming at you because you’re wrong…",en,books
"Practicing the Fine Art of Bitchitude
Another day, another batch of news copters circling the block. I have a nice flat roof - is it wrong to lay out Christmas lights that read ""bleep you, Rod?"" It would make the local news...
guess that makes me a psychopath because i only comb mine on good days :) i watched 1600 pennsylvania ave. on msnbc last night- for about 20 minutes. in that time, david shuster tried his darnedest to interview 2 psychiatrists and convince them that rod was crazy. they weren't buying and i don't either. he's a politician who has had no accountability- and since we have had an entire federal government like that for at least the past 8 years, does that make all of them certifiable? no- it just makes them criminal. instead of trying to make him crazy (or any of the rest) how about we start prosecuting? gah!
There is one good thing that will come out of this. SOMEONE is going to get the chance to make a lot of special new friends in prison! Bad hair and all.Illinois voters should get to vote which prison he goes to. Maximum or minimum security.
Ok, OK. Yabida Yabida. Done well. But now I see where Move-on.org got it's name.Next...

"I figured i'd start an AL Cy Young and MVP thread since the season is coming to an end shortly and liked to hear what you guys think. Wouldn't it be awesome if we had the Cy go to Moose and MVP go to A-Rod? I know that is extremely unlikely, but both are definitely in the top 3 imo.
Cy Young will probably go to Cliff Lee and MVP I'm thinking probably Carlos Quentin.
Given Arod has missed 20 games he's still in the top 10 of every offensive category and in the top 5 in HR, OBP, OPS, and SLG, it'll be interesting to see where he ends up. He could easily lead all categories except for RBI in the end.
As for Moose, I think he'd be the number one pick if it weren't for Cliff Lee's season, however, I think if he gets to 20 wins and the Yankees make the playoffs (we know the indians arent), that could help his value out a lot.
Edit: If someone could change the title of the thread to ""AL Cy Young and MVP,"" obviously there isn't going to be more than one MVP.",en,web
"SEC: All-Opening Month
While freshmen have ruled all the other BCS conferences, transfer players in the early going are ruling the SEC. Two crack this All-November list.

"John comes home to find Irene Adler sitting on the sofa reading The Guardian.
“Jesus fuck.” He drops the Tesco bag, and the milk hits the floor with a vague thump.
Irene looks up, “Honey, you’re home!”
John stares for a moment while Irene folds the paper. She’s dressed in a royal blue jumper, fitted, with a cowl neck and three quarter inch sleeves -- lightweight but elegant. Black slacks with an impeccable crease and leather boots complete the outfit. Her hair is slightly shorter, and down, falling in slight waves down her shoulders. John’s had enough girlfriends to know she’s wearing only minimal makeup, lipgloss and mascara, maybe a little blush. Her eyes are large and impossibly blue. The whole effect is softer, more feminine; it makes John nervous. He can recognize armor, the power in the pull of her usual up-do and the lines of her more severe makeup, but right now she looks . . . unarmed. It puts him on his guard.
Irene seems to notice, her eyes flicking up and down John’s body. She puts the paper on the coffee table.
“You’re taking me to dinner,” she announces, though she doesn’t move from the sofa.
A dozen thoughts flick through John’s mind, I thought you were dead and No, not in bloody hell among them. He licks his lips and asks, “Why?”
Irene reaches into a black bag at her right, pulls something out, and flicks it onto the coffee table between them. John steps forward so that he can see what it is. It’s a photograph of Sherlock; 8”x10”, glossy, color. Semi-poor quality, and clearly candid, almost surveillance-like in nature -- as if from a camera phone. Sherlock is on a street, looking at something to his left, gaze sharp, even in the questionable quality of the photograph. John picks it up off the table, but he doesn’t say anything.
“Notice the advertisement in the background?” Irene asks.
John wants to ask what that matters, but he’s already scanning the photograph. There’s a sign in the pub window behind Sherlock, advertising a band: the date was two weeks ago. John inhales sharply.
“How do I know this hasn’t been altered?”
Irene raises her eyebrows; it’s a sign of approval, though John doesn’t want to examine how he knows that. “Because my Photoshop skills are better than that, Dr. Watson.”
“You’re trying to tell me Sherlock is alive.” The way John says it, it’s an accusation.
“No, I am telling you Sherlock is alive,” Irene says. The correction makes John want to grind his teeth.
“Why would you want to tell me?”
“Because Sherlock Holmes is an idiot,” Irene says, and she sounds truly disgusted. “And I owe him, as much as it pains me to say it. I’d rather he not get himself killed before I can repay him. I do so hate debt.”
“Most people would say you’re too late,” John observes.
“You’re not most people,” Irene says.
John sighs. “Dinner?”
They end up at Angelo’s. It’s close and reasonably priced and John doesn’t want to risk a place where he doesn’t already know where all the exits are. They sit in the usual place, John in what was Sherlock’s seat, looking out, Irene with her back to the window. Angelo puts his hand on John’s shoulder and squeezes it when he brings their menus. He doesn’t offer them a candle.
“You took the picture?” John asks.
Irene shakes her head. “Someone I trust did.”
John hums, bites back a sharp retort at what he thinks Irene’s sense of trust is and who might earn it.
“No need to censor yourself,” Irene says. She takes a sip of her water. John shrugs.
“I saw him jump.” It comes out surprisingly steady, which surprises John. He hasn’t been able to trust his voice on this subject in months.
“I’d wager that you saw what he wanted you to see.”
John thinks about that, thinks about Sherlock’s keep your eyes fixed on me.
“And you were injured,” Irene continues. “I’d also wager you saw what you thought you’d see.”
“How did you know about that?” John asks. The words are sharp: good.
Irene smiles, looks up at the waiter. She orders lasagna and salad; John orders the carbonara and the waiter disappears again.
“Let’s just say some of my contacts still talk to me,” Irene says smoothly, shaking her napkin out and putting it on her lap.
“After you tried to blackmail the royal family, and then the entire British government, all with Moriarty’s help, you mean.”
“Yes, that’s exactly what I mean.” Irene’s not smiling anymore, but she’s still calm, unsurprised, even serene. John thinks about that for a moment, about her utter confidence; it’s silent until the food comes.
Irene picks up her fork, takes a few bites of lasagna. “That photograph was taken in Edinburgh, about three weeks ago, by my wife, Kate. You met her; she let you and Sherlock into my life.”
John recalls the woman who let them into Irene Adler’s house.
“And I trust her implicitly.”
John nods. So far, fair enough.
“Two days after that, the police found one Lucas Benedict bound and gagged in his own apartment outside Edinburgh. He wouldn’t tell the police who did it, but there was physical evidence in his trouser pocket linking him to two unsolved murders in Brussels-- a plastic bag of his fingernails that matched a torn nail at the crime scene. That, and the murder weapon was wrapped and bagged in his back pocket. Later, his phone records showed that he had contact with at least four known hitmen in the Leeds area.”
“I had met Lucas, just once. He was a bit dim about some things, but he was a fine shot and he followed orders impeccably, both things Moriarty liked in a man.”
“Jim introduced us.”
“Of course,” John manages.
Irene shrugs, spears a bite of salad.
“You’re trying to tell me -- excuse me -- telling me, that your wife took this picture of Sherlock two days before a member of Moriarty’s organization was captured in his own apartment.”
Irene merely looks at him.
“Which is supposed to prove . . . what? That Sherlock is alive?”
“Yes. John, I believe that Sherlock is not only alive, but that he is attempting to take down Moriarty’s organization piece by piece.”
“By faking his own death?” John asks.
“That so-called death was no more than a continuation of Jim Moriarty’s extraordinary bullshit.” It’s the first time Irene’s calm exterior has cracked; John’s intrigued.
“So you don’t believe Sherlock was a fake?”
“Of course not.” Irene’s cheeks pink up just slightly, even in the dim lighting. “Sherlock is many things, including an arrogant bastard, but he’s unusually honest about who he is. If he wasn’t, he’d have a lot more friends.”
John thinks about that. No, I know you’re for real. Well, nobody could fake being such an annoying dick all the time.
I’ve just got one.
The worst thing about this, John realizes, is not that it’s true, but that he desperately, achingly wants it to be true.
He takes a deep breath. “Even if all of this is true, that Sherlock is alive, that he faked his death, that he’s out there somewhere, working on Moriarty’s organization, why come to me?”
Irene looks at him, holds his eyes until John drops his gaze to the table.
“Mycroft has more resources,” John says.
“Mycroft is an asshole,” Irene counters.
“Look, John.” Irene pauses. “After my little flirtation with Moriarty, with the stakes in the . . . international scene . . . I was more than happy to retire to Scotland with my wife and start looking into sperm banks.”
John almost smiles.
“Then Sherlock Bloody Holmes has to pop round the neighborhood and throw a spanner into the works. I know things about Moriarty’s network that he doesn’t, and I don’t particularly want him to find out about them.”
“You’re trying to protect him?”
“I’m trying to keep him from getting himself actually killed. I know some things about power, John Watson: who has it, who wants it, how to get it, how to keep it. Sherlock is in over his head.”
“How do you know? That he can’t handle it, I mean.”
“Because I’ve met Sebastian Moran.”
“Exactly. Jim Moriarty was a brilliant bastard. But he was also a lunatic. And incapable of getting his hands dirty. But Moran --” Irene shakes her head.
John feels a cold sliver suddenly wedge itself between his shoulder blades.
Irene pushes her plate away. “Moran is incapable of keeping them clean. And he likes that.”
“This is a bloke you want me to meet?”
“Actually, I’d much prefer if you shoot him rather than talk to him, but I am flexible on the details,” Irene says, with an upward pull to the corner of her mouth.
John thinks about Sherlock, thinks about the killer cab driver. Thinks about what it will do to him if this is true. Thinks about what it will do to him if it isn’t. Thinks about Irene, how she has come back from the dead twice, how Sherlock wouldn’t speak of her. If this is a wild goose chase . . . at least he’d have something to do.
“Where do we start?” John asks.
“We find Sherlock before he finds Moran.”
John signals for the check.
John walks into the sitting room. Irene is up already, wrapped in a lush-looking white cotton bathrobe on the sofa, feet on the coffee table, laptop in her lap. There’s a cup of coffee beside her on the arm of the sofa.
For a moment, John feels a rush of deja vu, feels like it’s choking him, grief cutting off his air. He blinks, clears his throat.
Irene looks up, her ponytail swinging slightly from the motion. “There’s coffee in the kitchen.”
“Got that, yeah.” John continues to the kitchen, pours himself a cup, picks a banana up from the bowl on the counter; Mrs. Hudson must have been in yesterday. He goes back to the sitting room.
“Scotland was over two weeks ago, and he got to Benedict. He’s moved on.”
“Benedict was a leg-man, did grunt work, but he also spoke to Moriarty directly. Sherlock will be looking for someone of similar caliber.”
John nods again, continues to munch on the banana.
“He’s been careful about his money, of course. Fake documents, fake accounts, but real money. Most of it seems to be coming out of Geneva.” Irene shakes her head. “Predictable. The Caymans would have been a better choice. It also depends on if he got a name out of Benedict. It’s possible; the man wasn’t brilliant, and he’d wouldn’t have any incentive not to talk. Probably didn’t know about Moran. ” Irene looks up at him. “You don’t have any questions?”
“I have plenty of questions.” John shrugs.
Irene raises an eyebrow.
“Why should I trust you? Why won’t you leave Sherlock alone? Why do you care? Why me? Why stay here at Baker Street?”
“Are those rhetorical?”
John considers. “I don’t know.”
Irene closes her laptop. “Mostly, it’s because I’m angry.”
John hadn’t expected that.
“Don’t get me wrong. I’m not thrilled that Sherlock ruined my payday. But to be honest: I probably deserved it. I thought I could trifle with him, like I do with others. I thought I could trifle with Moriarty, too, and I was wrong there as well. I don’t like to be wrong. Sherlock saved my life because I was wrong, and I don’t like that, either. I’m grateful, but what I said before was true: I don’t like debts. I want to be even with Sherlock. I also don’t know if I care, exactly. It irks me that Sherlock thinks he’s invincible.”
John huffs, and it even sounds a little like a laugh. “I can relate to that.”
“That’s why I came to you. Also, because you care. Which I would think is why Sherlock is drawn to you as well.”
John’s not sure about this, but he nods anyway.
“I also think Sherlock is fascinating, and that he doesn’t deserve to get his brains blown out of his head by the likes of Sebastian Moran.”
“What did Moran do that makes you so sure about him?”
Irene’s face screws up for a moment. “I was at a cocktail party with Jim, posing as his date. I went because I wanted to size him up a little, see some of his circle.” Irene shrugs. “We were at the bar; Moran came up to us, and Jim introduced me. I knew immediately Moran worked for Moriarty. Jim had scribbled a number on his napkin, passed it over to Moran with his new drink, all very discreet, of course, but I made my living noticing details. Moran proceeded to tell me a story from his army days. It was about how he raped a woman at a party. That’s not what he called it, that’s not how he couched it, but that’s what it was. He told it to me to intimidate me, to see if he could make me afraid. He wanted power over me, and he wanted it immediately; that’s how he tried to get it.”
John’s suddenly sorry he ate the banana.
“When he saw that it made me disgusted, but not afraid, his eyes went cold. Blank. I had never seen that before. I didn’t want to see it again.”
John nods, clears his throat. He’s knows what she’s talking about; he served with someone like that, for whom killing wasn’t a grudging necessity but instead a release. He’s seen the look. He doesn’t want to see it again, either.
“And I’m staying here because I promised Kate I’d be safe, and apparently there’s no place safer than with John Watson.”
“How do you figure that?” John asks. “I was in the army, in a war zone, and then I lived with Sherlock for eighteen months.”
“You’re still here, aren’t you?”
“I got shot!”
“Irrelevant. My point stands.”
""There is absolutely no reason for you to trust me.""
John blinks, waits.
""But I trust you.""
Irene doesn't say anything else.
Irene is clearly getting ready to go out: fully dressed, hair pinned up, makeup. She is sliding her feet into heels when John walks into the kitchen.
""If Sherlock is alive, why isn't he going after Moriarty?"" It has been bothering John since last night.
Irene uses a tissue to blot her lipstick. ""Because Moriarty is dead.""
John swallows. ""Pardon?""
""I have an appointment to get to,"" Irene says. ""And so do you."" Irene passes him a business card from her purse.
John looks at the card, blows out a breath.
""I am sure you can find your way there,"" Irene says.
John grits his teeth, nods.
The morgue is quiet when John enters. Molly has just finished sliding a body back into the wall; she’s standing, filling out the last of the paperwork against the metal wall of closed slabs. John doesn’t think she heard him come in, the sound of the door covered by the closing of the slab, and he doesn’t want to frighten her, so he says, quietly, “Molly.”
The sound of his voice scares her anyway, makes her jump. She spins around to see him, hand held to her chest in surprise. “Oh, John.”
“Sorry, sorry. Didn’t mean to scare you,” John says.
“Oh, no, it’s all right.” Molly walks over, pats his arm awkwardly. “Quiet down here. Just me and . . .” she trails off.
“Yeah,” John says. He doesn’t know how to start. Everything he can think of sounds too harsh for the woman in front of him.
Molly’s forehead furrows. “Can I . . . Is there something I can help you with?” She’s holding the folder she was writing in to her chest.
“I. I need you tell me the truth.”
Molly’s eyelids flicker. “Of course.”
Molly stays stock still, but she doesn’t say anything.
“Molly, I need to know. Is Sherlock alive?”
Molly blinks. “John, I.”
John stares at her. He doesn’t use what he privately refers to as his army voice; he doesn’t step closer. He isn’t trying to intimidate her. He stands up straight, but he leaves his face open, for the first time since Sherlock . . . since Sherlock.
He’s not sure what Molly sees, but she steps forward, places a hand on his arm. “John.”
“Tell me the truth.” His voice is rough.
“What would make you think . . . why would you think Sherlock is alive?”
“There’s a photograph, Molly.”
“Oh.” Molly’s shoulders seems to ease. “Photographs can be altered, John.”
John shakes his head. “I don’t think so.”
“I. It’s natural . . . we don’t want to think people we . . . care about have died.”
“I don’t need your pity,” he says, sharply. More than he intended.
“Oh.” Molly takes her hand off his arm.
John takes a breath, thinks about what Molly isn’t saying. That’s ridiculous, John. Why would you ask me? What she did say: Why would you think Sherlock is alive? He closes his eyes, opens them. Suddenly he knows. Knows.
“What did he offer you, Molly?”
Molly blinks. “John?”
“Money? His attention?” It’s cruel, and he knows it; he just doesn’t care.
Molly steps back. “John.”
“He’s going to get himself killed, Molly. Tell me the truth.” No one’s been telling me the truth, John thinks.
“He. He knew it was going to happen.”
John blows out a breath he didn’t know he was holding.
“He knew Moriarty wanted him dead. I just . . . helped.”
“Drew blood from an unclaimed body. Assisted the . . . people he had enlisted. Forged the autopsy.” Molly says the last part very quietly.
“The people he enlisted?”
John nods. Thinks about the hands keeping him away from Sherlock. “Moriarty?”
Molly draws in a sharp breath. “I didn’t expect that.”
John knows that means Sherlock didn’t expect it, either. God.
“That was . . . that was a real autopsy,” Molly says. “Single gunshot wound to the head. Judging by the angle of the bullet and the exit wound, clearly self-inflicted.” The words are clinical, but Molly’s tone is not.
“Where’s the report?”
“In a safe-deposit box under a false name.”
John raises his eyebrows.
“I paid one of Sherlock’s contacts to set it up. Knew him from.” Molly stops.
“Why didn’t you tell me?”
Molly looks at him; it takes a moment for John to realize there are tears in her eyes. She looks confused. “I wasn’t supposed to. I promised.”
He’s late. Irene should have factored that in, but she’d rather wait than be late herself. Besides, she paid the driver for the day, so that isn’t an issue, and she has her laptop, wi-fi working thanks to a very stupid tenant in the building next to the car, 4A.
His car finally pulls up and he steps out. Irene opens her door, steps out onto the street to intercept him.
He stops three steps from her. “Ms. Adler.”
“Mr. Holmes,” Irene says. “May I have a chat?”
Mycroft smiles. It’s completely insincere. “If I recall correctly, your last chat with me didn’t go so well.”
Irene smiles back. It’s completely sincere. “I think this one will go differently.” She leans behind her, opens the car door. “After you.”
Irene gets in the car first, sliding to the far side to leave room for Mycroft, who slides in after her. She presses the button and the glass rises between them and them driver.
“I could have you arrested,” Mycroft says amiably.
“Of course. But if you were going to, you would have already done it. Besides, your intelligence rather needs some updating, don’t you think?”
“Is there something I can do for you, Ms. Adler? Or is this just a social call?”
“Sherlock is alive.”
Mycroft is silent.
“I wasn’t sure if you knew or not. Interesting he didn’t go to you for help. Seems your intelligence really does need some updating.”
“No. Quick swallow, tap of your second finger on your umbrella.”
“You’re not my brother.”
“Neither are you.”
“I like proof, Ms. Adler.”
“I’m sure you do.” Irene takes the photograph out of her bag, slides it over. Mycroft smiles. It’s more of a pull of his lips across his teeth than anything else. “Additionally, I think John Watson is about to get further confirmation from Dr. Molly Hooper.”
“Ah.” Mycroft hands the photograph back. “You’ve already involved Dr. Watson.”
Mycroft looks at her. “I think you’ll find Dr. Watson is not as easily led as my brother.”
“No. He’s a man who knows where to look.”
“What do you want?”
“Money. How banal, Ms. Adler.”
“If I’m going to follow your brother all the way around the world, I need funds to do it.”
“And why would you do that?”
“I don’t like debts, Mr. Holmes.”
“Yet you’ll ask me for money. Interesting.”
“I’m sure it is to you.”
“Whatever game my brother is playing, Ms. Adler, it doesn’t need to involve you.”
“I rather disagree.”
“I wouldn’t expect less.”
“It’s not a game.”
Mycroft looks at her.
Irene doesn’t even blink.
Finally, Mycroft sighs. “Zurich?”
“Off-shore Americas. Less obvious.”
“Of course.” Mycroft opens the car door. “I’ll text you the information, shall I?”
“And give you access to my phone? No. You’ll make the arrangements, write down the information. I’ll wait.”
Mycroft looks at her. “Don’t take this personally, Ms. Adler, but I sincerely hope after today that I never see you again.”
“Likewise, Mr. Holmes.”
“If I do, I’ll have you arrested.”
Irene smiles at him as he leaves the car.
They start in Barcelona. Irene had a contact there, man by the name of Epsom; someone she’d met in passing through Moriarty, but she had kept his contact information anyway.
When they reach the address, they find that the building had been burned to the ground four days prior. A quick record search shows Epsom is now in Interpol custody, under investigation for an unsolved murder in London as well as arson in Spain.
“Do I want to know how you have all those passwords?” John asks, reading over Irene’s shoulder.
“I’m going to say no,” Irene says.
“Four days. We’re not far behind.”
“In our terms. In Sherlock’s terms --” John says.
“The game is on.”
Venice ends with John in the canal, Irene skidding to a halt in the alley behind him.
John starts to swim, to break out to further water.
“John!” Irene is yelling. “John, let him go! He’s a bit player!”
John takes a deep breath so that he can plunge down again.
“John! Sherlock is already done here! Come ashore!”
John stops, starts to swim back. When he reaches the edge, Irene gives him a hand up.
“We’ll have to get you out of those wet clothes,” Irene says. Her mouth is twisted in something like dismay.
“Two days,” John says.
“Two days,” Irene agrees.
They end up in Paris based on a tip. Irene got a call from Kate; an old client had tried her previous mobile number.
They find the client in his flat, tied spread eagle to his bed, fully clothed. There are documents on his desk indicating his complicity in no less than five different heroin smuggling rings.
Irene laughs, then phones the police.
“Same day,” John says when they get back to the hotel. He is downright giddy, though he is also somewhat alarmed at that fact.
“Same day,” Irene says. She’s smiling.
John leans down before he really thinks about it. They’re a millimeter from kissing; John can feel Irene’s breath on his mouth before she takes a step back, puts her hand on his chest.
John shakes his head. “No. Damn it. Sorry.”
John can hear the question mark in her voice. It make him feel weary.
“I’m not the one you want,” Irene says gently.
John’s lips make a thin line. He takes a deep breath. “You’re not, are you?”
“I’m going to go to my room,” John says. He steps around her, opens the door.
“I’m sorry, John,” Irene says.
He leaves without asking her what she’s apologizing for.
Irene sits on the bench in the lobby of the monastery for two hours before Sherlock comes down the main staircase. His eyes widen as she stands and meets him halfway across the lobby, but otherwise his face doesn’t twitch.
“Shall we talk a walk, my dear?” she asks.
Sherlock inclines his head toward the door, falls into step with her.
“Martin Luther was a monk here,” Irene says as they step outside onto the stones and head to the street.
“So says every plaque within six miles of here,” Sherlock says.
“I did say virgin, not monk. Seems a bit extreme, even for you.”
“Cheap accommodations, reasonable rates.”
“You like symbolism.”
“Not in this case.”
“Moran is no longer here.”
“Flight out of Frankfurt two hours ago,” Sherlock agrees.
“Why didn’t you make your move?”
“Why did you?”
“Because you’re close. And you can’t take Moran out. Not on your own.”
Sherlock looks at her sharply. They turn onto the main street, near the square. “You are in no position to know that.”
“I am in each and every position to know that,” Irene says.
“I can handle him.”
“No, you can’t.”
“One could ask why you are taking such an interest in my business.”
“One could,” Irene agrees. “One might even say it’s because you are an idiot.”
Sherlock tenses around the eyes and mouth. They keep walking.
“The casual look is good on you,” Irene says. Sherlock is wearing jeans, a white button-down. It’s a warm day in May, sunny, few clouds in an endless blue sky.
“I might say the same,” Sherlock says. “Green is a flattering coloring on you.” Irene is wearing a lightweight green knit poncho over a long-white sleeved shirt and khaki pants, her hair down.
“Thank you, darling.”
They turn onto the street in front of the Erfurt Cathedral. “I don’t need your help,” Sherlock says.
“Yes, you do.”
“Do men usually think it is charming when you continue to contradict them?”
“Occasionally.” Irene pauses. “I did used to contradict them for a living.”
They walk a few more steps. Irene stops near a set of tables belonging to a nearby cafe. “Sherlock, no one wants to see you actually dead,” she says.
“Debatable,” John says, looking up from the paper he is reading at the nearest table.
Sherlock actually looks surprised. Irene smiles. “John.”
Irene looks between John and Sherlock. “Right then. I’m going back to the hotel. I won’t wait up.” She smiles at the two men, then walks away.
“I mean, I reckon that if anyone is going to kill you, I deserve the chance to do it,” John continues. “Earned the right, don’t you think? Put up with all the experiments. The thumbs in the fridge. The attempt at drugging me. The verbal abuse. The bloody violin at 3:30 in the morning. And you never did the shopping. Or paid the bills. Or, I don’t know, told me you were going to fake your death so that the bottom didn’t drop out of my entire life.”
“John,” Sherlock says.
“Might as well sit down, Sherlock,” John says. “Order a coffee.”
Sherlock sits. “John --”
“Oh, for God’s sake, Sherlock, shut it for once. Take a day off.”
Sherlock leans back in his chair, but he remains silent.
“Do you know, I didn’t know how I was going to feel about this moment. Would I be relieved to see you? I did believe Irene. I did. Believed Molly, too. Enough to follow Irene Adler around Europe for months. That takes commitment. You have to give that to me. I have commitment.
“But there was always that part of me, you know? The part that didn’t quite believe. The part that saw you jump from the roof of St. fucking Bart’s, that couldn’t find your pulse. The part that had to stand next to Mycroft at your funeral.
“I thought maybe seeing you would be a relief. That the grief would just disappear, like that, just like a magic trick. You know, I’m beginning to think that it doesn’t work that way. Mostly because I want to reach over and throttle you.”
“So I take it you weren’t expecting murderous rage,” Sherlock says, all cool vowels.
“Fuck you. Now is not the time to be a cheeky bastard.”
Sherlock’s eyes flick away. “I’m sorry.”
“You sure as hell should be.”
John takes a shaky breath; he can feel the prick of tears at the back of his eyes. He blinks once, twice. Three times, clears his throat. He hates it when his body betrays him.
“John.” Sherlock leans forward across the table. “Do you not understand that Sebastian Moran has had a bullet in his rifle with your name on it since that day on the roof?”
John slaps his palm on the table so hard the teenagers at the table next to them stare. “Do you not understand this is not about being right?”
“Then let me put this in terms you might understand: you let Moriarty win.”
“What? Because the press bought Richard Brook’s story? A few half-truths and innuendo --”
“This is not about the press. It’s not about Scotland Yard. What did Moriarty promise you at the pool?”
“That he would burn me.”
“That he would burn the heart out of you.” John watches Sherlock’s eyes widen a fraction.
“What do you think would happen to me if you died?” Sherlock asks.
His soft tone brings John up short. “What do you think happened to me when you did die?”
Sherlock takes a breath. “Your heart can take it,” he says.
John brings his hand up, puts his palm over his eyes. “I’m not so sure.”
“Every day. Every day that we are separated.” John stops. He can’t say it for Sherlock. He can’t. Especially if he’s not sure it is true anymore, that he embodies Sherlock’s heart. If Sherlock doesn’t see, can’t deduce this . . . “Every day, Moriarty wins.” He moves his hand.
“The only way Moriarty wins is if you’re dead.”
John almost laughs. “Really? What if I had believed the fairy tale? What if I thought you were all Moriarty tried to make you out to be? A man who fiddled with the lives of others on whims, who ordered me to be strapped into Semtex for his own amusement.”
Sherlock’s eyes flicker in the way that means he’s thinking -- they go to the cathedral, John’s coffee cup, track a couple walking by, all while his brain scrolls through options, rejects or accepts scenarios. John waits.
“You would have left me.”
“Yeah.” John has almost forgotten that for all of Sherlock’s genius, he’s sometimes a step behind when it comes to these things.
“It would have separated us.”
“Instead, I separated us.”
Sherlock looks furious. He throws himself back in his chair.
This time, John leans forward. “Fortunately for you, I am smarter than you are.”
Sherlock looks startled, then finds John’s eyes. He starts to laugh.
John laughs, too. Now he feels relief.
They share a moment of companionable silence, the sun shining down on them.
“What does that mean, that we shouldn’t be separated?” Sherlock finally says. He looks at John.
John swallows. He thinks about deflecting the question; he could try a joke, or turn it on Sherlock. “Maybe that we are stronger together than we are apart.”
“Hmm.” Sherlock says. “Obvious.”
John rolls his eyes.
“Sentiment,” Sherlock says.
“It’s not just for us ordinary people anymore.”
Sherlock wrinkles his nose. “Is this what people feel all the time?”
“This . . . crushing feeling in the chest like . . . it’s a wound and a well all at once. Gaping, but full.”
John looks down at the table. “Not all the time.”
Sherlock still manages to look puzzled. “So when, then?” Sherlock rubs his chest through his shirt, like he has heartburn.
“Only when.” He stops, looks at Sherlock. Really looks at Sherlock. “You bastard.”
“What?” Sherlock only looks more confused.
“You’re having me on.”
“What?” Now Sherlock looks confused and slightly offended.
Sherlock suddenly grins. John laughs, can’t help it, laughs at the stupid bastard.
“The heart is forever inexperienced,” Sherlock says.
“There is no remedy for love but to love more.” John takes a breath.
Sherlock smiles, and raises an eyebrow.
“I read,” John says.
Sherlock throws his head back and laughs. John would be offended, but he knows his reading habits are not why Sherlock is laughing.
John wakes to the sound of Sherlock receiving a text. He’s a little hot, and more than a little cramped, legs still twined with Sherlock’s as they make do in the single bed in Sherlock’s room at the monastery. He huffs a breath onto Sherlock’s collarbone.
“You have got to change the sound on that notification,” John says.
“Why? I like it,” Sherlock says, reaching over John to pick the phone up from the table. The glow from the screen highlights his face as John places a gentle bite on his throat for revenge.
Sherlock frowns slightly, thumbs out a reply.
“Just checked into a hostel in New York, according to his credit card info. Or at least, one of his credit cards has.” Sherlock puts the phone back on the table. “We’re on a flight out of Frankfurt at three.”
“When’s the first train?”
“What time --”
“2:30. We have a little more time.”
John looks up into Sherlock’s face. “Sleep?”
Sherlock rolls, pinning John underneath him. “Perhaps in a moment.”
John leans up to kiss him, capturing Sherlock’s mouth with his own.
Irene gets them first-class seats together. John and Sherlock on one side, Irene across the aisle. The flight is still interminable.
When they get to New York, they take a cab to the Waldorf Astoria. Irene checks them into three suites.
“I don’t really care who sleeps where; just want to make sure I use the budget,” she says, off of a look from John.
Sherlock closes his eyes and takes a deep breath. “I do so love spending Mycroft’s money.”
“I don’t like this,” John says.
“Too easy,” Irene agrees, taking a sip of cappuccino.
“Perhaps if we weren’t traveling in a pack,” Sherlock says, looking out the window.
“Sloppy,” John says.
“Yes.” Sherlock doesn’t even turn around.
“Him, not us.”
Sherlock raises an eyebrow but doesn’t say anything.
Irene’s eyes narrow. “I think he’s coming toward us.”
Sebastian Moran is indeed crossing the street, directly headed toward the coffee shop where they are sitting near the front window.
Sherlock looks at John.
“We stand our ground,” John says. “I’m not giving this bloke an inch.”
“I’m not sure we have much of a choice,” Sherlock murmurs as Moran opens the door and walks right up to their table.
“Ms. Adler,” Moran says. “How lovely to see you again.” Moran is of average height, taller than John but a bit shorter than Sherlock, but John is once again surprised at how good looking he is, in a very classic, very American way: square jaw, close cropped blond hair, green eyes. He reminds John vaguely of Daniel Craig, if Craig were American and had broader shoulders. The Southern accent, all long vowels and softly dropped “r”s -- the way he says Irene’s name as if it ends in an “a” -- seems incongruous with those shoulders.
“I wish I could say the same,” Irene says, tone infinitely polite though the look on her face edges toward disgust.
Moran smiles as if she’s made a joke. “Dr. Watson, Mr. Holmes.” Moran inclines his head toward John and Sherlock in turn. John keeps his expression stony. Sherlock inclines his head back toward Moran.
“Mind if I pull up a chair?” Moran asks, though he’s already doing just that, pulling a chair from the empty table behind them and wedging himself between Irene and John. “Don’t worry about me; I’d order but I don’t think I’ll be here long enough to finish my beverage.”
“Of course.” Irene’s smile is utterly false.
Sherlock’s eyes are roaming around Moran’s form; John watches from the corner of his eye as Sherlock’s gaze traces Moran’s face, clothes, haircut. He wonders what Sherlock is seeing, observing, but for once Sherlock is utterly silent. And completely still. It’s unnerving, at least to John, until he realizes it reminds him of a cat, the way they size up their prey with complete stillness and attention. Prey. John likes the idea, can’t find it in himself to care that maybe he shouldn’t.
“Is there something we can do for you?” John asks.
“No, this is really more of a social call,” Moran says.
“Really.” Irene sounds doubtful.
“Oh, yes.” Moran smiles. “I’ve only ever met you, Ms. Adler, and I thought it might be a good idea to meet all of my would-be assassins in person.”
Irene’s smile could cut glass. “You flatter us, Mr. Moran.”
“Do I? Dr. Watson is a former Captain in the RAMC, and I hear he’s quite the shot. Mr. Holmes . . . well, frankly I have no idea how good he is with a gun, but I wouldn’t put it past him to try to be clever about it. Poison, knife work. Knives are always interesting -- personal, yet precise. Well, as precise as the handler, and I have the feeling that Mr. Holmes would be very, very precise. As for you, Ms. Adler, well. You’re a cunt.”
“Thank you,” Irene says. John’s eyebrows reach his hairline.
“Don’t mention it,” Moran says, but he’s looking at Sherlock.
“Is this the part where you try to bargain with us, get us to cut a deal with you?” John asks.
“Gracious, no,” Moran says. “I have no interest in bargaining. I just wanted to meet you before I kill you.”
“Right then,” John says.
“I find it’s more fun that way. Well, let’s not kid ourselves here, we’re all smart people, it’s always fun, but I do find the personal approach to be quite fulfilling, myself. I like looking people in the eye. It’s always nice if I’ve done it before the moment the lights go out.”
“You’re very sure of yourself,” Irene says.
“Been doing it long enough. Maybe I’ve been in the game too long . . . no. No, I don’t think so. It’s always a plus when you love your work. Don’t you think so, Ms. Adler?”
“That’s what they say, though I have no idea who they are,” Irene replies.
Moran looks at Irene and smiles. Irene continues to look at him, but John can tell it’s a close thing.
“Aren’t you finished?” Sherlock asks, uncrossing his legs and leaning back.
“It speaks,” Moran says.
“You must be finished. You came over here with the express purpose of trying to intimidate us, which has rather spectacularly failed. Shouldn’t you be on your way now?”
“That’s it? Jim was obsessed with you, and so far, I am not seeing why.”
Sherlock smiles faintly. “Clearly you are trying to provoke me, but since you asked: we tracked you to the bookstore across the way from a bottom-basement hostel in Chelsea, which indicates that either you don’t have access to many funds or that you simply like that kind of environment. Considering that you’ve been in seven European cities in the last ten days, and that you’ve been to Hong Kong in the last month, it could still be either option -- you may well be out of money by now -- but my conclusion is that you simply like the milieu. Lots of other travelers and far many more transients, many of which are either young, and easily taken advantage of, or traveled and seasoned, easily aggressive. You like both kinds; casually steal from the young and the tourists, pick fights with the aggressive. The slight purple spot above your right eye suggests that you were in a fistfight just last night. You won handily, of course, but it was enough of a thrill to last you until you thought up this little scheme to say hello. Were there not any girls there without boyfriends or that let themselves be caught alone? Someone in Prague wasn’t so lucky.
“But that’s just the last few weeks. Do you want me to talk about your illustrious military career, where you got away with state-sanctioned murder for years until you got caught slitting the throat of a semi-well connected translator in Baghdad? America had had enough embarrassment already, but then again the general populace wouldn’t really have cared about some Arab foreigner anyway, so you probably would have beat the wrap if some of the men in your own company hadn’t felt so uncomfortable about the outright murder of a civilian that your CO had to take action. Dishonorable discharge, tried out for the Green Berets four times and failed, all four times, but at least your file ran across the desk of one of Jim Moriarty’s associates, who hired you for a simple B&E in Miami. Worked your way through Moriarty’s orginization, not a surprise, considering your tendencies for violence, quick work, and loyalty.
“You’re thinking now that I could have had that information in a dossier somewhere, and you may be right, though certainly not from my brother, who may or may not have been keeping an eye on you for some time, which has less to do with your connection to Moriarty and everything to do with a series of electronic thefts from high-level British bank accounts. Not Mycroft’s own, fortunately for us, but a few of his acquaintances, and my brother doesn’t make even those easily. He would have taken it personally; he is so odd about that. He didn’t share it with me, though, so you are wrong about the dossier, but you’ll believe what you want to believe.
“The rest is easy, even predictable. American Southern accent . . . Alabama. Grew up on a military base, probably Rucker, but your accent is too easy to place for you to have been the child of an active duty soldier -- you didn’t move around enough; American Army likes to move people, shake them up, but not your father, no. Your father was a clerical worker, by my estimation an accountant, but that would have required more education than he had, more of a bookkeeper, low-level finance, an assistant to someone he both looked up to and resented his entire career. Dead relatively early, sudden, most likely a heart attack, based on his sedentary work life and completely awful eating habits. In any case, it was quick, certainly not a long illness where you might have had to care for him.
“You looked up to him, even though he was a stupid man, unhappy in a mediocre job in an absolutely dismal area of the country. Likely a pretty heavy drinker, though not an alcoholic. Only child, your mother adored you, though God knows why, probably some kind of denial about your actual nature. Might have leaned on you a little too hard, particularly when your father was beating the hell out of her, which he did, regularly. You always sided with him, though, at first likely because he never laid a finger on you. You took that to mean that you were better, somehow, and certainly better than your mother, whom you came to thought deserved the abuse. Broke her arm because she burned dinner? She shouldn’t have burned it in the first place. Can’t the woman tell time or set the oven to the right temperature?
“It’s pathetic, really. Not a pleasant childhood, certainly not, but others go through worse, don’t turn out like you. Probably pre-disposed to your violent and controlling nature somehow, in the way your brain is wired, fascinating how nature can really have the last say. Nurture didn’t help in this case, but you made the wrong choices all the way around, mostly be idolizing that son-of-a-bitch father of yours, but here we are. I do hope you donate your body to science; neurologists would have a field day with you.”
There’s a moment of silence at the table before Moran bursts into laughter.
“God, that was great. First-rate. No wonder Jimmy liked you. Thank you.”
Sherlock inclines his head, as if accepting the compliment.
“I would love to stay and chat all day, I really would, but I should be going. Business, of course.”
“Of course,” Sherlock agrees smoothly.
“Dr. Watson?” Moran turns to John.
John blinks. Sherlock leans forward, suddenly tense, all straight lines.
“What?” John asks.
“In approximately two minutes you and I are going to leave together.”
“Excuse me?” John says.
“Well, come on now. I can’t come and meet all of you and then just get up and walk away, wait for you to try to flush me out again. That would be stupid. I would take Mr. Holmes, but that’s too obvious. I could kill him, of course, but then the fun would be over, and theoretically I would still have you and Ms. Adler to worry about. I could take Ms. Adler, though, frankly, I can’t stand her, and though I think she’d be terrific to have around for a few days of games, in the end it might not be worth the trouble. The police and the press might take her too seriously should anyone find the body; white women who meet horrible ends do get so much attention in this country. Not that they would find the body, but I like to be cautious about these kinds of things.
“If I take Dr. Watson, however, I would still have the upper hand. Ms. Adler feels just obligated enough to Dr. Watson to actually listen to what I would tell her to do, and you, Mr. Holmes, well. If I have Dr. Watson, you’ll do anything I want, which would be amazing. Dr. Watson himself would be a bit of a threat, but I’m pretty sure I can handle him with the right tools. My guess is that he doesn’t handle drugs well, does he? I’m not sure I can keep him on a leash on a long-term basis, but I probably won’t have to; someone will break in one way or the other. Or I could just overdose him after a few days, easy peasy.” Moran shrugs.
“What makes you think I’m just going to walk out of here with you?” John asks.
“Shit,” Sherlock says, lunging across the table at Moran. Moran is faster, though, jabbing the syringe into John’s leg under the table and pressing down the plunger even as Sherlock grabs his wrist. John’s already starting to lean forward groggily.
“What did you give him?” Sherlock asks.
Moran grins. “As if I would tell you.” He looks back at where some of the cafe staff is headed their way, other patrons curious about the sudden disturbance. “Dr. Watson is going to come with me, nice and easy, or I put the syringe in Ms. Adler’s hand and you two can explain it to the police these lovely people are about to call.”
Irene catches Sherlock’s eye, shakes her head slightly.
Sherlock’s face has gone absolutely white, his hands shaking with helplessness and rage.
Moran puts his hand under John’s elbow to steady him. “Come on, Dr. Watson. Let’s go for a walk.”
John stands, knees a little shaky.
“Say good-bye to your friends,” Moran instructs as they walk away from the table.
They’re not out the door for five seconds before Sherlock is after them. Irene curses and throws money on the table, follows.
Moran is halfway down the block, trying to hail a cab; Sherlock is being blocked by the city’s foot traffic. He’s trying to make his way around a trio of female tourists (Irene can tell, they are looking up) when John’s leg clearly goes out from under him; Irene can see how suddenly he crumples to the ground, barely making it onto the curb and not the street.
Moran looks down at John, looks at Sherlock, and runs.
Sherlock finally pushes the youngest of the women out of the way, makes his way to John.
John is already shaking his head.
“John,” Sherlock says, stopping, dropping into a crouch.
“Go,” John says as Irene catches up. He’s gritting his teeth, blinking rapidly -- whether it’s from pain or from the drug, Irene can’t tell. Sherlock’s reaching out, hands on John’s wrists, chest, opening his eyes further to see his pupils.
“Sherlock,” John says, and it’s slurred, something that alarms Irene, but suddenly John is making clear eye contact with Sherlock, and he nods slightly, deliberately.
Whatever Sherlock sees makes him stand up and run.
Irene looks down; passerby are starting to circle around them, a couple of them have their cell phones out.
“Go,” John says.
“I can’t just leave you.”
“You can’t leave him on his own; Moran . . .the whole point . . . ”
Irene looks away, down where she can barely see the bob of Sherlock’s head in the crowd. When she looks back, John is looking up at her.
“Good Samaritans,” he says. “Go.”
“You’re a lot more trusting than I am, John,” Irene says.
“Be fine. Go.”
Irene nods once, then takes off after Moran and Sherlock. She reaches the Avenue -- Moran has crossed ahead of Sherlock; Irene sees with dismay that he’s bounding up the steps of the bloody Met. Sherlock is nearly getting himself killed crossing the street against the light, but he makes it, clears the first set of steps as Moran is entering the building. Irene crosses as soon as the light changes, but she’s far behind. By the time she reaches the entrance, both men have disappeared. She makes a calculation, and goes left.
Moran’s still in the museum, Sherlock is sure of it. They’ve drawn enough attention that security is following him at a discreet distance; the chatter from their walkie-talkies suggests that they were doing the same with Moran, but that someone just lost him. Sherlock needs to do the same or they’re back to hunting, back to airports and another city.
He ducks into the Met Store, walks quickly around the other patrons. It’s crowded, but Sherlock uses that to his advantage, shielding his body with the people milling around him. By the time he exits through the other side, security is still scanning the area where the posters and prints are sold.
Sherlock thinks. Layout of the museum: entrances and exits, public and private; exhibitions, ongoing and special; stairwells, elevators, offices, halls. Rooms, it’s all rooms . . . so which room? Moran could just leave but that’s not . . . he has something to prove now, especially now that his plan with John hasn’t worked out. John. John, sitting in the street. John. Focus, focus, focus. Focus.
Sherlock hums. Ah. He turns right.
“The symbolism is a little heavy-handed, don’t you think?”
Moran chuckles. It echoes off the walls. “This room is almost always nearly empty,” he says. “I find it odd. But they do say chivalry is dead.”
Sherlock shrugs. “Tourists like Impressionists.”
“I think they’re wrong, though. Arms and armor is fascinating And your knight in shining armor is quite possibly seizing in the street even as we speak.”
John. Sherlock forces his heartbeat to slow. “What did you give him?”
Moran shakes his head. “No. Too easy.”
“So what do you propose we do, then? Discuss courtly love? Arthurian mythology?”
“I was thinking we could just end this.” Moran draws a gun out of his waistband.
“Shouldn’t you have left that at coat check?”
“I have a friend who lets me keep it in her desk drawer; she doesn’t have to go through the metal detectors.”
“You have a friend?”
“Well, the sister of an army buddy who is petrified of me. Let’s not split hairs. You think I didn’t plan for this contingency? Why the hell else would I be on the upper east side?”
Moran levels the gun, and Sherlock thinks ricochet.
Suddenly Moran cries out and goes down, his grip on the gun loosening. Sherlock darts forward to grab it, but hears Irene’s voice: “Don’t.” He stops immediately and looks up.
Irene is standing over Moran, who is writhing on the floor and bleeding profusely from the . . . shoe in his back.
Sherlock stands up and looks at Irene, who is calmly but quickly putting on the mate to the heel sticking out of Moran while pulling her hair half out of the bun it’s in.
“Tear my dress,” she orders. Sherlock does it without question, ripping her right sleeve and part of the bodice of her black cotton dress. He steps back as two security guards round the corner.
Irene immediately bursts into tears. “Thank God, thank you, thank you . . .”
The guards stop, look down at Moran on the floor and then at Irene. One of them fishes out his radio and steps away, calling for back up and an ambulance.
“He, he . . . he grabbed me off the street . . . brought me in some strange back way.” Irene starts to cry harder. “I thought . . . I thought he was going to kill me, he had a gun . . . this man was just trying to help --” she breaks off as the tears start to obscure her speech.
One of the guards looks down at Irene sympathetically. “I’m sorry, ma’am. I’m sorry . . . you’ll have to make a statement.” He pauses, looks at Sherlock. “You, too, sir.
Irene and Sherlock nod. The guard offers Irene a handkerchief.
John is sprawled on the couch in Sherlock’s suite by the time Sherlock and Irene come in shortly before midnight.
John moves his arm from his eyes. “Enough phenobarbital to choke a horse. And he put it in my bad leg.”
“Shouldn’t you be in hospital?” Irene asks, sitting in the chair opposite the couch.
Sherlock moves John’s feet so that he can sit down, then places John’s bare feet back in his lap. “Your limp is psychosomatic.”
John lifts his head off the cushion he is using as a pillow and glares. “Only partially psychosomatic.”
“Irene’s right, you should be in hospital.”
“Checked myself out against medical advice.”
Sherlock huffs out an annoyed breath.
“They wanted to check me in for observation. I’m a doctor, I can observe myself; all I need to do is sleep it off.”
“I have you to observe me,” John amends. Sherlock smiles faintly. “What happened with the two of you? All I got was a text that said you were fine and a police station.”
“Irene got a new pair of shoes,” Sherlock drawls.
Irene smiles. “Prada spring/summer 2012 collection.”
“She stole them from costume institute exhibit at the Met.”
John looks at her.
“I had to ditch my former shoes in the trash bin, poor things. They were flats, though.”
“I can’t believe they let you walk out of the police station with both shoes,” Sherlock remarks. Irene looks at him. “One of them was evidence!”
Irene catches John’s look. “I stabbed Moran in the back with it.”
“Oh, of course.”
“Besides, they were the only pair of shoes I had.”
Sherlock rolls his eyes, but settles back into the couch, indicating he is not about to argue . . . yet. “That and the fact that by the time we were told we could leave they had run Moran’s fingerprints, and some very official looking men in suits were starting to arrive.”
“Our run-in with him was starting to look like the least of his worries,” Irene finishes. “I also flirted with one of the police, asked nicely for my shoes back.”
“That goes without saying,” Sherlock says.
Irene nods. She looks between John and Sherlock. “I am going to go have a long bath and call the wife.” She stands. “Good night, boys.”
As soon as the door clicks shut, Sherlock looks at John.
“I am not going to have this conversation with you,” John says flatly.
Sherlock breathes out sharply through his nose. “You could have died.”
“Fine,” John says. “Let me summarize for you how this is going to go: You are going to complain that emotions and feelings only get in the way of your processes, your work, and that therefore they are extraneous to your life. I am going to call bullshit on that and say that, first of all, you already have emotions, and you did even before you met me, like how fond you were -- and are -- of Mrs. Hudson. You will say that’s just bowing to social conventions, and I will say that you never bow to social conventions, unless it suits you in the moment, which you will somehow take as only confirming your point. You will then point out that if I hadn’t been hurt you would have been able to take down Moran more efficiently, and I will say that you did take Moran down anyway. You will take responsibility for getting me drugged; I will point out that it was Moran who drugged me, and who is therefore responsible, not you. I will go on to further say that you are just talking out of fear. You’ll sputter about how preposterous that is for a while, but I will continue to tell you that I am an adult who is perfectly capable of making my own choices, like adults do, and that if you were another reasonable adult, which of course you are not, but let’s pretend that you are, you would recognize that and leave me to my own choices, which do involve things like living with you, working cases with you, and otherwise being in love with you. I would then say that you can’t attempt to control me by breaking up with me, which is kind of what you tried to do by faking your death, and that you need to respect the choice I’ve made. Which is to be with you. Even if your life is dangerous. And if you’re an idiot.”
“That’s a mouthful for someone who was shot up with phenobarbital.”
“I slept before you came in to build up my strength for your enormous emotional problems.”
“You love me?”
The angle of John’s mouth softens. “Yes. Which you knew.”
Sherlock nods. “Repeated results are the best way to conclude experiments.”
“Good. Then let’s stop experimenting and get on with living.”
“Bed?” Sherlock asks.
John nods. “I could still sleep for a week.”
“Then let’s get started,” Sherlock says, standing and helping John off the couch.
Sherlock and John meet Irene in the lobby late the next morning. She has her bag with her.
“Leaving so soon?” Sherlock asks.
“Scotland calls,” Irene says. “My work here is done.”
“You two are staying?”
“I think we’ve earned a holiday,” John says. “Hang around for a few day, see the sights.”
Sherlock grins. “I do so love spending Mycroft’s money.”
“Enjoy,” Irene says. She stretches up and gives Sherlock a kiss on the cheek, then hugs John. “Don’t be strangers.”
“If that thing works out with the bank, let us know,” John says. Irene smiles.
“Bank?” Sherlock asks.
John starts to shake his head. “Nothing.”
Sherlock takes in John’s expression, Irene’s smile. “Oh. Oh.” He pauses. “You could just ask me.”
John’s mouth drops open.
“Don’t look so shocked, John. I probably have an obligation to pass on my clearly superior genetic material, and this would be the perfect way to do it. Irene is intelligent, clever, attractive . . . she’d be perfect, really, and it’s not like I’d have any responsibility to raise the child.”
John shuts his mouth. Irene laughs at his expression.
“Relax, John. I have no interest in raising a small version of that.”
John still looks slightly put out, but he smiles. Irene pats his arm. “Goodbye, gentlemen,” she says, heading toward the exit with her small rolling suitcase.
John and Sherlock watch her leave. “What would you like to do to start our holiday?” Sherlock asks.
“I was thinking we could go back to bed,” John says, a sly smile inching across his face.
“Room service for lunch?”
“Perfect,” John says, taking Sherlock’s face in his hands and kissing him.",en,books
"We recently experienced what was possibly the last of the summer rains, as luck would have it, this occurred during game drive time. After delaying our early morning drive until the worst rain had passed, my two brave guests from the UK and I ventured out. It was difficult to pick up any sign on the animals as all tracks had been washed away. Eventually we managed to track down a breeding herd of elephants, especially entertaining was a young elephant of about a year old who seemed delighted to plunge his trunk into every small puddle along the road. He also had fun stretching his trunk out to the limit to smell at us. It was also amazing the amount of chameleons we saw that night perched in trees, my eagle eyed tracker Respect said he spotted about ten!

"The first day of spring was a couple of days ago, and I for one am glad to see it - except that I can already tell the pollen is starting to come out. I'm like a human barometer for that every year. :-)
I'm sorry I have not posted much here over the last few weeks. I've been incredibly busy with regular store business. For folks that blog several times a week, or even several times a day, my question is - how the heck do you guys have the time? I always think of Glen Reynolds over at Instapundit. He posts maybe 10-20 times a day all day long, and I figure whatever else he does, his entire life must revolve around his blog. When he's not blogging, he's thinking about blogging, or looking for things to blog about, or conversing with people that write in about the blog. I seem to always have something else to do that needs to be done NOW. Anyway, my goal here is going to be to post at least once a week, so we'll see how that turns out.
It has been another exciting week here at Anime Corner world headquarters, and I have several items to share with you:
Ergo Proxy 3 arrived on Friday - we had it air freighted in from Geneon so we could start shipping orders as early as possible. We're shipping it now and all of your pre-orders were filled by close of business on Friday March 23rd. Oh yeah, all of our copies of Ergo 3 in this shipment have the limited pencil board - we'll be shipping those first until they run out.
I spend a lot of my time here on 'logistics' - you know, figuring out where and when and how stuffis coming, and there certainly has been a lot of activity in that dept this week. We got a slew of new solicitations over that last couple of weeks for June and July titles and we'll have them all up on the site shortly. A couple of the new titles include Galaxy Angel AA and MAR which are already posted. Also, Geneon will be re-releasing Ikki Tousen in a Thin-Pak (same price, same bat channel) in June and won't be repressing the old box, so it will probably be unavailable for a short time until the new boxes come out. Finally, we now have the last volume of Inu Yasha up for pre-order - volume #55! Wow - 4 years to get a series released, it reminds me if Urusei Yatsura or DBZ. Now when are the rest of those IY boxed sets coming??.... -_^
We have a couple more date changes this week - in fact there have been so many lately they are getting hard to keep up with. Tactics 4 was pushed from 3-20 to 3-27, but became moot as it has already arrived. The new company Illumitoon pushed the BoBoBoBo 2 DVD from 4-6 to 5-1. They also announced that the Beet 2 DVD and the BT'X 2 DVD have been pulled entirely from the release schedule and will be re-announced at a later date. Since these titles have sold moderately well, one can only speculate at this point as to what their plans are, but we'll keep on top of things and let you know. Geneon cancelled the Paradise Kiss 3 Special Edition DVD, but the regular edition is still set to street on April 17th.
I know I've done a lot of talking about the upcoming Melancholy limited edition boxes. Sam, the product manager at Bandai, told me this week that they are producing exactly 20,000 boxed sets for the North American release, and they were surprised by the massive amount of retailer pre-orders for them that have already been placed. The boxes are made overseas and the order has been placed by Bandai, so Sam says quote ""once they are gone there is no more - period"". I can almost guarantee you that this box is now, or almost is, sold out in pre-release and will be allocated to retailers by Bandai. Sam said that retailers who order early will be more likely to get the product that they ordered. That's good news as we got our order in on the first day, so our units are right at the front of the line and we will be able to guarantee delivery of boxes up to about the first 500 pre-ordered (we're 82% of the way there now as of 3/23), and I will probably close the pre-order window once we hit the 500 mark.
We have posted quite a few new announcements for pre-order, some of the more notable include Wings of Rean, the 4th Naruto Uncut Box, the 2nd Prince of Tennis Box, the 2nd Ranma 1/2 Thin-Pak, and the first Freedom DVD (HDDVD/DVD) which will be the very first HD-DVD Anime release here in North America. I was wondering when that was going to happen. :-)
A lot of people have been asking us recently what we plan to do about the postal rate increase coming next month. Admittedly shipping charges have been a point of consternation for us as we try to offer you a great deal of choices, excellent delivery time and quality, and still offer shipping at a reasonable price. We have not increased our shipping prices in 3 years even though all of the carriers have increased their rates to us several times during this period. As shipping has become the 'condiment' of the internet shopping world (you know, serve a lower quality hot-dog but give the mustard away for free), it's become very challenging for us to try to put together a new shipping program that covers our actual freight costs but that fits the requirements of all of your diverse needs. We are currently working on a new shipping program that is similar to what we offer now, with our usual diverse selection or types, carriers, and quality of delivery, but that will also offer more choices for budget minded customers. We'll be integrating the new program into the new order checkout manager, and we would greatly appreciate any input on this subject that you guys have for us. Your comments help us better tailor our program to fit your specific needs, and that's what it's all about.
After many requests, we've expanded our trade in program to include video games, even really old ones. Check our trade in FAQ for details.
I have two great sales for you this week, one is a newsletter exclusive set of coupons that you canuse across the store, and the other is a nice set of overstocked figure discounts (up to 35% off) that we need to move out to make room for new arrivals. Newsletter subscribers can combine the two offers to save even more! See below for all the info.
To save 3% off any order over $75, use the following coupon code during checkout:
Or to save 5% off any order over $150, use the following coupon code during checkout:
Coupons are valid ONLY for NEW orders, and are good through Thursday, March 29th only.
You can combine the two offers to save even more!
We have some great new stuff for this week in just about every category from DVD's to Manga to Figures to Statues, and even some cool new character merchandise including new scrolls and a couple of rare Anime themed bath towels that arrived from Japan. Be sure to take a look at the excellent new Sana Horiuchi figure from Pia Carrot and the very large Tamaki Kousaka from To Heart as they are two of my favorites. Also, we have a few of both of the new Tandem Twins girls left over after filling your pre-orders - including the much sought after 'option' parts that bring the figures, well, to their full potential. :-)
Finally, we received a special shipment of art books that I was able to coax away from one of our vendors in Tokyo. Many of these gorgeous art books have been out of print for more than 5 years and since they are extremely rare we might only have as little as 2 or 3 copies of each.
This little shipment was a long time in the making, and I hope we are able to help you fill some of the holes in your collection. I know it certainly helped mine. :-)",en,web

***Photo by Elliot Cowan. Left to right: me, Linda Beck, and Tim Rauch. Deeper in the background are Willy Hartland and Ray Kosarin. From drinks after the ASIFA event.
ASIFA-East's Linda Beck just put together a panel on the State of NY Animation, and you can read Katie Cropper's tidy summary of it at the ASIFA-East exposure sheet blog at www.asifaeast.com. The panel discussion was moderated by Linda Beck and featured Howard Beckerman, David Wachtenheim, Steve Connor, and myself.
Howard Beckerman was his usual charming self and to record all his wisdom here would be impossible. I will say that he was a calming voice of reason, giving us example after example of how this has all happened before. He also shared some of his strategies for surviving in this fickle industry, reminding that when one door closed another always opened. In other words, when theatrical cartoons dwindled TV commercials appeared to pick up the slack.
Steve Connor pragmatically suggested that everyone devote their efforts to making solid work on schedule and on budget and how that alone can help keep projects flowing in the Big Apple. He also suggested that even independent projects could be planned out with a better process that could be applied to making the same project with a larger crew should the project grow to a series.
David Wachtenheim (of Wachtenheim/Marianetti) eloquently spoke of shrinking budgets and less commercial work floating around these days. He worried about the perception of clients, that there's a kid in his living room somewhere that can do the work cheaper and at a ""good enough"" quality.
After the panel, fifty of us headed over to grab drinks at a nearby bar. While I was munching on a burger, Katie Cropper and I were discussing the evening. She told me that my message of ""make things happen, make your own luck, and work on your own projects,"" suited my personality. ""It's natural for you to do that,"" she said. And, this made me wonder just how much personality weighs in to a career. Although I would caution that what one does well often appears to others as if its effortless or simply natural.
No two of us are hard wired the same way. And, I think too many of us are at the mercy of our own harmful thinking. At the panel, I explained that I don't give much thought to what is going on in the economy and how it might effect NY animation. Instead, I am aware (as Howard Beckerman kept pointing out) that NY animation has always had its ups and downs. My focus is to only worry about what I can control. Therefore, I make films, I pitch shows and children's books. I look out for interesting work opportunities and am careful to nurture relationships that often lead to more work.
During the panel, I told the audience that I tried to follow a smart plan as an at-home freelancer. In my current pair of freelance gigs for Sesame Workshop, I am sure to check in with the client on a regular basis to give them updates on the status of the work. Recently, they had an internal meeting to change the creative direction on one of the jobs. The producer gave me the choice of coming in for the meeting or just getting an update afterwards. For me, there was no choice. Of course I wanted to be at the meeting! Not only would attending the meeting allow me to get on the same creative page with the group, but it would also be a chance to meet with another set of folks from Sesame Workshop. I want to be more than just an anonymous freelancer uploading and downloading work. I understand that relationships are important to getting future work.
How much of this is based on personality and how much of this is just ol' fashioned common sense? I think it weighs heavier towards common sense. As if to provide the opposite to my story above, I heard of another animation artist who scuttled his working relationship with a new client after he came in for a meeting and then decided to bill them for it. This instantly caused a squabble and this artist was told that if he kept the charge for the meeting on his bill, they would pay it, but would not work with him again. The artist chose to be paid and kissed the relationship goodbye. Subsequently another artist got the job and worked on that particular project for almost a whole year. The industry will have its up and downs, but the greatest risk we face is making our own personal droughts.
Each of us IS different, but better sense can be adapted by all. Personality helps and hurts in different turns and factors in to what jobs are the right and wrong fits for us. For one of my long-term flash series directing jobs, I later found out that the producers also interviewed another experienced director who had several flash series to his name, while I had none. The producers told me that they didn't hire him because he was too much of a football coach personality, while I was mellow and non-threatening. My personality helped me win that day, but this ""football coach"" director has continued on with his own great career. Clearly, he's a great fit for many employers, football coach-style and all.
Good sense and sound judgment can be learned, but only if a person is open to learning from their own mistakes. A closed off person with an old-school ""the producers or client is always out to screw me"" attitude is not going to get far. And if they do get far, they will have had to be the most talented person in the room. That's not an option available to me, so I've always pushed other skills, learned other lessons, and kept applying them forward. The mistakes I've made can fill a book (actually, three!), which only proves that mistakes don't have to be career-killers, unless we decide that they are.
Furthermore at the panel discussion, some wondered what will happen as India and South Korea (and others) gear up to build strong animation industries. ""They're going to take our jobs,"" many worried. I say, that's only possible if there's such a thing as ""our jobs."" I argue that there is NOT. There are no agreed upon jobs that are ours for the taking or that can be reserved for us like a rental car. Not on an individual level, nor a city-wide level, nor a national level. We have to reach out for those jobs...to create them ourselves. There's no such thing as entitlement. Just because we decided to be journeymen animation artists doesn't mean the industry owes us squat. This can be empowering if you let it. That's how I think. Who can say I'm wrong? It's my view of the universe and it holds true in my own head, and it helps me survive and navigate this difficult industry.
Some in the audience bemoaned NYC animation as primarily a preschool animation city. And, while many of the series have been preschool shows, there have also been older kids shows made here such as Sheep in the Big City, Codename: Kids Next Door, Kappa Mikey, Courage the Cowardly Dog, Doug, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. There has also been a batch of ""adult"" or animation for tweens in the form of Beavis and Butthead, The Head, Celebrity Death Match, Daria, Downtown, Fridays, The Venture Bros., Super Jail, Assy McGee, Gary the Rat, and This Just In. This city is what we make it. If your goal is to make animation for a different audience, then the ball is in your court. If you succeed, it may not change the perception of NY animation over night, but it will be a step in a different direction. Everything is a first until it isn't. Feature animation was not a reality in this country until Disney made it happen. No British rock band had ever broken through to the American market until The Beatles. The first one through the door has a tendency to leave the door open for what comes next.
Don't get me wrong, I don't have solid plans myself. I never have. I don't assume to know what I will be able to accomplish. I have assorted goals, but none of them have expiration dates on them. So, the only direction I have in my career is that I am going after my goals. Each day I work towards achieving them. And, I don't look at external obstacles as my problem. In my own head, the state of NY Animation is a perpetually a green traffic light.

Why have I stayed in NY... instead of ""heading west young man?"" It's an interesting question to ponder, although its rare that I think about this. I never set out to be a booster of the NY animation scene. I was born here. My dad earned a terrific living as top Advertising Art director and executive (at one point he was even a vice president at Benton & Bowles), so I saw one could survive and thrive working in the commercial arts in the NY area. There was only one thing against me. No, it wasn't the anemic NY animation industry. It was my own underdeveloped talents. Spending four years at SVA didn't change that, and that was no fault to SVA. It was my own stubborn refusal to work hard enough to challenge myself. In fact, I didn't even know I had made that choice. But, choices are often made silently, aren't they?
When I was privileged with the opportunity to work at Michael Sporn's studio it was both at once a rarified experience as well as typical to New York animation. Rare in that Michael's studio (then and now) tackled animation from beginning to end. No outsourcing like much of the production at MTV, Jumbo, Curious, 4Kids, Scholastic, World Leaders, (and others that have since come and gone). Here was a place to learn it all from top to bottom, because of a supportive boss like Michael and the wonderful staff that followed his lead. I soon had the opportunity to try my hand at storyboards, designs, animation, writing...all within the two year period I worked at his studio.
While this would have indeed been rare to get this variety of experience at some NY studios in such a short amount of time, it WAS representative of a key an aspect of NY animation. Namely; flexibility. Getting to do different things on different projects. That's something I have never taken for granted. It still tickles me that I get to do that.
No, I'm not a character designer in the Phil Rynda sense (he is amazing, by the way.) Just check out http://philrynda.blogspot.com/
But, by being in NYC animation I get design opportunties just the same. I recently whipped out the above 3 designs after sesame workshop hired me to animate a 30 second spot. They wanted to see lots of different design approaches so I spent two or three days exploring some possible styles. They loved one particular design (not shown above) so much that they asked me to just animate that character as it was drawn. These fun little gigs, they seem very ""NYC animation"" to me. It's part of our blend of the independent and the commercial. Michael Sporn, his disciples, and those of the other NY botique-style animation studios (Buzzco, JJs, Asterisk, Wachtenheim and Marianetti, etc) are the true face of NY animation. They are the survivors that remain as the big studios come and go.
So, in NY animation we find ourselves with a happy problem. What to call oneself? Am I a director? A filmmaker? A designer? A writer? An author? A teacher? An animator? A jack of all trades but a master of none? To some, I'm simply the president of ASIFA-East. But, in NY animation, one doesn't have to choose one label. And, by some absurd turn of fate, this formerly raw SVA graduate is now paid to do all of these things (well, except the president of ASIFA-East thing). Why have I stayed in NY? Where else could one have such a career? And, best of all, I could list more than a hundred people just like me. Only chances are, they will be better designers.

I have been an adjunct teacher since 2003. That was the year that Richard O'Connor recommended me to Parsons School of Design to temporarily take over a class he was teaching. I was deep in my ""land of milk and honey"" Blue's Clue's job, which turned out to be almost 8 years of end-to-end employment. Back then, I wasn't hurting for money, and it would have been very easy to turn the teaching down. Most of my colleagues weren't teaching on the side. A small handful were. Teaching is something that had always been on my personal fear list and therefore it was something I had to do. If something is a new experience, it's probably something useful. In fact, animation producer Tina Moglia just told my career class that her only factor to stay on a job is, ""Am I learning anything?""
So, how do you get an opportunity to teach? First of all, work in the industry. Local schools such as Parsons, Pratt, SVA, and NYU don't require that an adjunct teacher have a Master's degree or even a Bachelor's degree. You only need to be a working professional and that includes most of us! The next thing to do is to be an active member of the animation community. Let others see you running events, making films, and volunteering for organization's like ASIFA-East. This will grow your profile and show that you are reliable and able to juggle multiple tasks. Thirdly, tell animation teachers you know that you're interested in teaching. Current teachers are often the first ones to hear about positions opening. Usually, current teachers get a crack at the first new opportunities, but not all of them are a good fit, and many times a teacher will be able to pass the lead on to their contacts. Lastly, you can also try to set up a meeting with the head of the school's animation department and present yourself as a potential teacher.
The interesting thing about teaching one class is that it tends to mushroom into several classes, perhaps even spread over different schools. Just six months after taking on my first class at Parsons, Machi Tantillo recommended that I take over her Animation Career class at SVA. It was the class that inadvertently launched me as an author when my class plan spun off for the book, Your Career in Animation: How to Survive and Thrive (Allworth Press). A couple of years later, John Canemaker brought me in as temporary teacher at NYU's Tisch School of the Arts, at which I will return to teach a pair of classes this year. School's like to give multiple classes to teachers that are already proven commodities, which only makes sense. But, new teachers crack through every so often, so try to make yourself one of the success stories by following the plan above.
The income that my first class brought in (teaching one 15-week class pays about $3,000) wasn't something I needed in 2003. But, it sure helped me in 2004 when I returned to the freelance life for 10 months, and again in 2007 to the present day when I became a full-time at-home freelancer. Income-wise, teaching has become a life-line, a guaranteed check that I can count on. It represents the very least amount of money I can make in a tough year such as 2009. The other nice thing about teaching is how it flexible it can be. Many times, the teacher can suggest a day and time that works best for them. When possible, I try to do most of my teaching at 6 PM classes, and that way when I have a full time in-house job, the class won't interfere.
Most of all, I really appreciate the way teaching puts me into contact with the upcoming generations of animation artists. It's inspiring to see the work they do and then to see them achieving success in the industry upon graduation. Its nice to know that, as a teacher, you had some small part in that. Not all the work an animation artist takes on in a career is work we can feel proud of...but, I find teaching has always been a rewarding experience. It's become a vital part of my career cocktail. Its the lime in my gin and tonic. A small part, but one the makes a big contribution to the whole.

*Note: image above from Janet Perlman's film, HotSeat.
I never know what will touch a nerve in my SVA animation career class. So, I was very pleased when a healthy debate erupted based on the ""Desktop Dilemma"" section of Chapter 7 in my book, ""Your Career in Animation: How to Survive and Thrive."" Assuming you have the book (I can dream, can't I?), I'll give you a minute to look that section up. In short, it was a cautionary tale of how an animation artist could damage his reputation by adorning his wall space and desktop computer with swim suit models and scantily clad teen starlets.
Look at any studio's animation cubicles and offices and you'll find personal items such as posters, toys, family photos, doodles, and other decorations at most every workstation. The stuff we surround ourselves with projects an image. Its a public display of our tastes, humor, and personality. But, how much should one share at the workplace? Even when it comes to the creative workspaces in this industry?
In response to the ""Desktop Dilemma"" story above, one female class member explained that if she sees pictures in the workplace that objectify woman, it feels like a personal attack. It makes her feel as if she is being looked at as a sexual object around the office.
The particulars of office culture comes into play when trying to understand this complicated issue. A preschool series tends to have young children, mothers, child development specialists, and female network executives walking through the office on a regular basis. Its easy to understand why it would not be desirable to have anything potentially offensive on display.
One male student objected and felt that the images described in ""Desktop Dilemma"" were not offensive to him... and, besides, another studio in town that animates edgy adult swim and comedy central series' had much worse on their walls. The difference, I explained, was that the edgy studio was an independent company, set up to reflect the taste and personality of its owner. For some, that might be reason enough to not want to work there. Not everyone is the right fit for every situation. And, on the male students first point (he did not understand what was offensive about swimsuit pictures), I told him the issue wasn't his personal definition of what was offensive. Instead, the point is to be sensitive that somebody else ""might"" take offense.
I'm not sure I got this point across either. Later that night (after class), a trusted friend suggested that for men that didn't understand what could be offensive about female swimsuit pictures posted at the office,...maybe they would understand it in other terms that might be offensive to them. There's a long list of potentially offensive material that I wouldn't recommend displaying in the workplace: images that are racist, anti-Semitic, anti-Muslim, anti-Christian, homophobic, etc. Think of the what might offend you and understand that there are some women who might be offended by your sports illustrated swim suit calendar or copies of Maxim magazine.
The bottom line is that the office, desk, chairs, stapler, computers, and walls, are not your property. You are only keeping the seat warm for the length of time you are on a project. You are working in someone else's home in a highly collaborative process staffed by men and women of all kinds.
I tried one last time to reach this male student. I asked him, ""Is it worth the risk of harming your reputation to prove a point that you're entitled to express yourself no-matter-what the circumstances? Not quite sure if this was understood either, I asked, ""What are your goals on a job? Are you there to conduct a sociological experiment to determine what percent of a staff might be offended by your wall-hangings?...Or, are you there to be an animation artist working in harmony with the rest of the team?",en,web
"The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced tonight the 15 films that made the shortlist for Best Documentary at the 85th Academy Awards, narrowed down from 126 qualifying submissions. Some of the notables include Ai Weiwei: Never Sorry, Bully, Chasing Ice, The Imposter, Searching for Sugar Man, and This Is Not a Film.
Hit the jump for the full list. For more on the Oscar nominee landscape, check out our previews for Best Picture/Director, Best Actor/Actress, Best Supporting Actor/Actress, and a rundown of the animated/screenplay/technical awards.
If you have followed our Sundance coverage over the last week and a half, you know how massive the festival can feel from afar. These are the movies that will fill arthouses over the next year, so perhaps the best place for those who could not make it to Park City to start is at the end, with the announcement of the awards. In terms of the major awards, the Grand Jury Prizes went to Beasts of the Southern Wild (Dramatic), The House I Live In (in the Documentary category), Violeta Went to Heaven (World Dramatic), and The Law in These Parts (World Documentary). Beasts of the Southern Wild, the consensus critical darling, also won for cinematography and a producers’ award. Thankfully Fox Searchlight made a deal to bring Beasts to a theater near you soon.
The Audience Awards went to The Surrogate (Dramatic), The Invisible War (Documentary), Valley of Saints (World Dramatic), and Searching for Sugar Man (World Documentary). The cast of The Surrogates—led by John Hawkes, Helen Hunt, and William H. Macy—doubled up with the Jury Prize for Ensemble Acting. Fox Searchlight also picked up The Surrogates. Love that studio. Hit the jump for the press release with the expansive list of award winners.
I had a blast at this year’s Sundance Film Festival and I can’t wait to go again next year. Today, Sundance announced their In-Competition line-ups for 2012 and already I’m trying to plan out how I’m going to see all of them (which is impossible, but it’s nice to dream). The U.S. Dramatic Competition features For Ellen, Nobody Walks, Safety Not Guaranteed, Smashed, and more. There are also some interesting-sounding films in the U.S. Documentary Competition including Finding North, The Invisible War, and The Other Dream Team.
Hit the jump to check out the full press release, which includes the in-competition line-ups for U.S. Dramatic Competition, U.S. Documentary Competition, World Cinema Dramatic Competition, and World Cinema Documentary Competition. The 2012 Sundance Film Festival runs from January 19 – 29th.",en,web
"We are about five years and one month past the financial meltdown, when America's largest and most prestigious banks could no longer hide the fact they were in big trouble--and were taking everyone else with them.
Fortune Magazine columnist Allan Sloan recalls:
It's hard to believe, but it's been five years and a day since the U.S. financial system's problems surfaced, and we're still not even remotely close to being able to feel good about the economy. My admittedly arbitrary start date is June 12, 2007, the day the Wall Street Journal reported that two Bear Stearns hedge funds that owned mortgage securities were in big trouble. At the time, things didn't seem all that grim -- in fact, U.S. stocks hit an all-time high four months later. But in retrospect the travails of the funds, which collapsed within weeks, were a tip-off that a crisis was afoot. Problems kept erupting, efforts to restore calm failed, and we trembled on the brink of a financial abyss in 2008-09. Things have gotten better since then, but still aren't close to being right.Sloan observes that only five years away from these shattering events, myth is already displacing reality (and some people wonder why I distrust the reliability of the gospel accounts of Jesus and such.)
There's a long way to go before the economy, and people, recover from wounds inflicted by the financial meltdown. The value of homeowners' equity -- most Americans' biggest single financial asset -- is down $4.7 trillion, about 41%, since June 2007, according to the Federal Reserve. The U.S. stock market has lost $1.9 trillion of value, by Wilshire Associates' count. Even worse, we've got fewer people working now -- 142.3 million -- than then (146.1 million), even though the working-age population has grown. So while plenty of folks are doing well and entire industries have recovered, people on average are worse off than they were. Bad stuff.
Sloan reminds us of the facts. I'll just list them here. Go read the article.
Myth No. 1: The government should have done nothing.
Myth No. 2: The government bailed out shareholders.
Myth No. 3: The Volcker Rule will save us.
Myth No. 4: Taxpayers are off the hook for future failures.
Myth No. 5: It's the government's fault.
Sloan's article generated reaction. In a follow-up article, he brought out more facts and reasoning to deal with the rabble. First he deals with the cries over Myth #1, the myth that the government shouldn't have done anything:
Dozens of commenters said that cleaning up the mess should have been left to the private markets, which would have done things better than the Federal Reserve, Treasury, and rest of the government did.Other objectors told Sloan the government should have done something else. He dispenses with this line of thinking, too.
What most of those people probably don't realize, though, and what I had no room to discuss in my last column, is that private markets took the first big swing at recapitalizing troubled financial institutions -- and struck out.
The alternate complaint -- that the government should have nationalized troubled institutions -- sounds plausible too. But that strategy stood no chance of working, regardless of how things played out in other countries. First, seizure would have resulted in endless litigation. Second, there were practical problems. For example, when I looked into the consequences of the government nationalizing Citi, I discovered (from independent third parties) that Citi most likely would have had to surrender lucrative franchises in several foreign countries that don't allow banks there to be owned by foreign governments.A third complaint made to Sloan dealt with Myth #5, that the government was really to blame for the financial meltdown. Sloan explains why this is bunk:
The other widespread criticism was of my last point: that although the government lowered some mortgage loan standards, the debacle is primarily the private sector's fault. I was attacking the oh-so-convenient myth that private markets are blameless and pure, that the whole problem comes from misguided government efforts to help ""those people"" get homes they couldn't afford. Many commenters were, shall we say, displeased.Sloan closes by reminding all of us just how bad it was five years ago.
Well, let's see. Most of the bad mortgages were made to supposedly qualified borrowers, without pressure from the government. Lenders required little in the way of down payments or credit checks; they wanted to juice up their loan volume. Credit-rating agencies gave AAA ratings to trash, to keep fee income flowing. Yield-hungry investors snapped up garbage that bore the agencies' imprimatur. Private enterprise all the way.
Credit default swaps and other esoterica spread the problems worldwide, magnified losses, and put even the soundest institutions at risk. That's because if giant, less sound institutions had failed en masse, they would have defaulted on their obligations to their sounder trading partners.To me, the big takeaway is that the financial meltdown was caused and magnified by bad business and poor regulation. And although the crisis was mitigated by cooperation between business and government, we still need lots of partnership, transparent decision making, and cool-headed leadership on both sides.
We also need to remember that for all the criticism (including mine) of particular tactics, Hank Paulson and Tim Geithner and Ben Bernanke bailed out the U.S. financial system at no net expense to America's taxpayers. An impressive achievement.
Instead of a discussion about what happened, we've gotten into a government-vs.-free-market shoutfest. These fragmented days, many people tend to see things in black and white terms, in ways that reinforce what they want to believe. The real world is more complicated than that. Black and white have their places -- but to understand the financial meltdown, you need to see some gray.
We need business to step up and we need government to stay involved and proactive.",en,books

"Its not a question. What just happened is a sentence of sorts. If it were a question it would have a question mark and then I could make some comment about it being the same thing that I ask myself after watching every single DeNiro movie since Heat. How has the once Travis Bickle, Jake LaMotta and Don Corleone fucked up so coniderably of late. Well you want some good news. He's pretty damn good in this, and seeing as most Bobby films revolve around whether or not Bobby is good, by extension this film is pretty damn good.
Based on producer Art Linsons scathing attack on the business of film (What Just Happened?: Bitter Hollywood Tales from the Front Line, wait a sec that has a question mark...fuck it) DeNiro takes on the Art-esque role of Ben a movie producer struggling with two failed marriages, a director that wants a dead dog and a company exec that doesn't and a petulent, fat, beardy Bruce Willis. Oh and his daughter may have been shagging an agent who killed himself, but thats not really important.
So how come DeNiro has made a film this decade thats not only tolerable but actually very good. Well because he's making a film about something close to his heart (and mine). Namely movies, movies, movies! But will you like it? Probably not. Unless you have an unhealthy obsession will all things celluloid, because all the jokes, all the drama, in fact every bloody thing about the film is about films. Yay!
But then again, good characters and great dialogue (""These drugs are so good you could watch your mother be gangraped and still enjoy the weather"") transcend any boundaries of theme and content and What Just Happened has some of both. And while you might not get who each person is supposed to be in real life without resorting back to the source material unless you've been living under a rock you'll get a kick out of Bruce Willis as Bruce Willis with the best beard this side of the one above this review.",en,books
"In the news, there is a team at CERN stating that they have measured the speed of neutrinos to be greater than the speed of light. What's wrong with that?
One of the fundamental concept in physics is Lorentz invariance. What this means is that if I apply the Lorentz transformation laws to an equation that I think is valid in one frame of reference, this equation would not changed in another frame of reference.
Now, in the Lorentz transformation laws, we get this factor:
γ =(1 - (v/c)2)-½.
Should the speed of a particle be greater than the speed of light (v > c), then the γ factor becomes an imaginary number! This brings humongus headache to the theory. One way out is to postulate that the particle has an imaginary mass (tachyons) since this factor often multiplies the mass of the particle, and the product of two imaginary number is a real number. However in the real world, masses are real quantity, not imaginary, so particles with a mass must travel at a speed less than the speed of light, and only massless particles ( m = 0) can travel at the speed c.
In the case of the recent findings about the neutrinos traveling at a speed greater than light, that would contradict this theory which has been around for over 100 years. That's why the findings, if confirmed, would be disturbing, to say the least.",en,academic
"BUFFALO, N.Y. -- Buffalo Sabres captain Jason Pominville didn't know how to react, because he wasn't initially sure whether his one-timer from the left circle 56 seconds into overtime actually went in.
""I didn't see it,"" Pominville said. ""I just blanked out.""
Don't look now, but here come the Sabres after Pominville secured a 3-2 victory over the Carolina Hurricanes on Wednesday night.
Regarded as one of the NHL's biggest flops a mere six weeks ago, the Sabres (31-28-8) are on a 12-4-3 roll that's allowed them to go from 14th place in the Eastern Conference standings into a tie with Washington for ninth -- two points behind Winnipeg for the eighth and final playoff spot.
""It's huge. We're making steps,"" said Pominville, who added an assist. ""We're playing better hockey. We've dug ourselves in a big hole that isn't easy to get ourselves out of. But we believe.""
Pominville's goal came with 10 seconds left in Carolina defenceman Bryan Allen's hooking penalty. Parked atop the left circle, Pominville took a pass from Christian Ehrhoff and blasted it inside the far post. Goalie Cam Ward appeared to be screened by defenceman Jay Harrison.
Thomas Vanek had a goal and assist, and Tyler Myers also scored for Buffalo, which bounced back from a 3-1 loss at Winnipeg on Monday night.
The Sabres are 7-1-2 in their past 10 games in a run that's reminiscent of a year ago, when they closed the season 16-4-4 to earn a playoff spot on the final weekend.
""It's nice to have a chance at it,"" said Ryan Miller, who stopped 22 shots. ""We just have to be excited for this opportunity. There's a lot of hockey left to be played.""
Jaroslav Spacek and Chad LaRose scored for the Hurricanes, who ran out of steam in being outshot 25-17 in the first two periods, and 42-24 overall.
Time is running out for the Hurricanes (25-27-15), who moved into a tie for 13th with the New York Islanders. Carolina sits seven points back of Winnipeg with 15 games left.
""Our guys, you can tell by the way we're playing, we believe we can battle every night and keep picking up points,"" coach Kirk Muller said. ""We're scratching and clawing for every point.""
The trouble is, the Hurricanes continue to have difficulty winning on the road, where they're 8-14-9. Coming off a 4-3 overtime win at Washington a day earlier, the Hurricanes failed to win consecutive road games for the first time since October.
And they continue to struggle in games that go past regulation. Carolina dropped to 3-9 in overtime games, and is 0-6 in shootouts this season.
Lack of discipline cost the Hurricanes, who gave up two power play goals on seven chances.
""Those penalties, we've got to be a little more smarter about that,"" Spacek said. ""We didn't play a patient game in the end. A couple of penalties in the third period and it probably cost us the game.""
Carolina's power-power play lacked finish, too, failing to convert on three opportunities. And that included not getting a shot on goal while enjoying a two-man advantage spanning 1:21 in the third period.
Down 1-0 after Spacek opened the scoring 2:47 into the game, the Sabres carried much of the play in the second period. Buffalo scored twice in the first 1:02.
Myers tied it 22 seconds into the period when he blasted a shot from the right circle and the rebound caromed in off Carolina defenceman Justin Faulk.
Vanek scored 40 seconds later on a power play. Ward stopped Ehrhoff's point shot, but couldn't control the rebound. Parked in front, Vanek's initial backhander was stopped before he dug out the loose puck, turned toward the net and swept it in the open right side.
LaRose tied it 5:11 into the second period, converting Jeff Skinner's centring pass.
""This is our playoffs,"" Sabres coach Lindy Ruff said. ""We've put ourselves on a nice run, but it's one game at a time and being ready to pick up the two points and move on to the next game.""
Notes: Muller said C Tuomo Ruutu is expected to return at some point next week. Ruutu missed his 10th straight game with an upper-body injury. ... Hurricanes C Eric Staal had his 12-game points streak snapped. The streak was the team's longest since it moved to Carolina in 1997. ... Sabres rookie C Cody Hodgson and D Alexander Sulzer played their first games in Buffalo since being acquired in a trade that sent Zack Kassian and Marc-Andre Gragnani to Vancouver on Feb. 27. ... Sabres D Andrej Sekera did not play because of the flu.",en,web

"ONE: Middle Age Queasy
The Conservative Political Action Conference turns 40 this year, but don’t expect maturity from a gathering where the speakers include Sarah Palin, Ted Cruz, Artur Davis, Dick Morris, Wayne LaPierre, Rick Perry, Allen West and Donald Trump.
The coveted keynote slot will provide a generous 33 minutes for Cruz to prevaricate, obfuscate, fabricate, fulminate and regurgitate. Organizers have allotted the second and third longest slots to Palin and Trump, respectively, though why Palin needs 16 minutes and Trump 14 to recite “me, me, glorious me” is a mystery only slightly less mysterious than either of them being invited to begin with. I suppose The Donald and The Sarah deserve grudging credit for realizing that Fitzgerald’s dictum about American lives having no second acts is irrelevant now that first acts can simply be prolonged indefinitely.
Over and above her CPAC gig, Palin manages to keep busy just being Palin. She devoted at least part of Monday to crafting a tweet celebrating the overturning of New York City’s ban on sodas larger than 16 ounces:
Victory in NYC for liberty-loving soda drinkers. To politicians with too much time on their hands we say: Govt, stay out of my refrigerator!
Yes, because nothing says “liberty” like 17 ounces of carbonated water, HFCS, artificial color, artificial flavors and caffeine. But it’s not all freewheeling Twittery for Palin; her latest higher calling is nothing less than saving Christmas:
The former Republican vice presidential candidate and Alaska governor has a deal with HarperCollins for “A Happy Holiday IS a Merry Christmas,” scheduled for November.
HarperCollins announced Monday that the book will criticize the “over-commercialism” and “homogenization” of Christmas and call for a renewed emphasis on the religious importance.
Wow! Only 48 years after A Charlie Brown Christmas definitively addressed the very same issues. And Palin’s so versatile that she even wrote the first review of the not-yet-written book:
“This will be a fun, festive, thought provoking book, which will encourage all to see what is possible when we unite in defense of our faith and ignore the politically correct Scrooges who would rather take Christ out of Christmas.”
That’s what cutting edge is all about, Charlie Brown. You betcha. As for Trump, he’s taking his cues from none other than Charlie Brown doppelganger Newt Gingrich, who last Friday tweeted his brainstorm to save White House tours recently suspended under sequestration:
Donald trump should offer to pay for the white house tours. He can afford it and it would show who cares more for American students
This was followed two minutes later by:
Trump and president obsma both golf but trump doesn’t charge the taxpayers $920,000 for a golf weekend in florida.
Yeah, damn that obsma anyway! Two minutes later, Gingrich found some more meat on that bone:
If trump offers to pay for the White House tours what will President Obama’s excuse for punishing visiting school children be?
Trump was nonplussed about all this until he joined Fox and Friends by phone on Monday:
“I think it’s so nice of Newt to suggest that,” the media mogul said, adding that Gingrich and his wife are members of his club in Washington. “But it sounds reasonable to me. Why not?”
Gingrich is also speaking at CPAC, so he and Trump have a readymade opportunity to discuss the idea in detail, assuming the Gaylord National Hotel has a room large enough to accommodate both their egos simultaneously.
TWO: In Through the Out Door
CPAC drew criticism recently for barring GOProud, an action that prompted the Log Cabin Republicans to withdraw from the event in solidarity. The groups have now gained some exceptionally unsavory company: notorious Islamophobe Pamela Geller.
Geller devoted a recent appearance with Christian radio host Janet Mefferd to throwing a tantrum about the CPAC snub:
… I’ve always held events there even though I wasn’t warmly welcomed because of the influence of what can only be described as Muslim Brotherhood facilitators or operatives like Suhail Khan and Grover Norquist… This year I could not get an event, I was banned…
What are they doing at CPAC? Essentially they are enforcing the Sharia. Under the Sharia, the blasphemy laws, you cannot say, you cannot offend, you cannot criticize and you cannot insult Islam. That is effectively what they’re doing, they are enforcing the Sharia.
Also joining GOProud and the Log Cabin Republicans, albeit voluntarily, is MSNBC’s resident purveyor of flapdoodle, SE Cupp. She recently tendered her regrets, publicly:
“… as a proponent of gay rights, CPAC’s decision to sideline GOProud and Log Cabin Republicans makes me increasingly uncomfortable… It seems like we’re hardly in a position to be marginalizing any kinds of conservatives, let alone ones who have been so courageous in the face of adversity… until the conference stops shaming some of its most valuable advocates, it’s unfortunately not an event I can take part in.”
Cupp’s calmly reasoned position prompted a fretful rant from Mr. Unreason himself, Joseph Farah. Sensing the black helicopters of tolerance hovering over his pinched and pusillanimous reality, WND’s founding father lamented:
This little brouhaha with Cupp comes at the same time dozens of Republicans – including top advisers to former President George W. Bush, four former governors and two members of Congress – have signed a legal brief arguing in favor of same-sex marriage…
Farah went on to shake a querulous finger at Meg Whitman, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, Richard Hanna, Stephen Hadley, Carlos Gutierrez, James Comey, David Stockman and Deborah Pryce, noted conservatives all. Or not:
What do all these people have in common?
They are not conservatives.
Ah. Good to know, I guess. Farah finished with a flourish of hyperbole worthy of a pilled-up teenager posting on a message board at 4:00 AM:
The Conservative Political Action Conference is for conservatives – not for people who seek to undermine the Judeo-Christian basis of Western civilization with one of the most radical ideas considered since child sacrifice.
Keep it unreal, Joe.
THREE: Hot Air Apparent
CPAC 2013 will also feature John Ellis “Jeb” Bush, who recently stuck his head up out of the ground to find out whether he would see Mitt Romney’s shadow. Bush is ostensibly in the public eye these days because he’s hawking a new book, Immigration Wars: Forging an American Solution, but of course what he’s really hawking is the idea that the GOP will be desperate enough to nominate him in 2016. To that end, Bush has been appearing on various talk shows, casually trying to convince conservatives of his viability with a string of inane observations.

"Cyclocross - Steel CX bikes...corrosion?
Bikeforums.net is a forum about nothing but bikes. Our community can help you find information about hard-to-find and localized information like bicycle tours, specialties like where in your area to have your recumbent bike serviced, or what are the best bicycle tires and seats for the activities you use your bike for.
10-26-04, 08:51 PM
Thinking about my first cross bike, mostly to ride local fireroads and mild singletrack. Ride quality makes me think steel is the way to go. But I'm wondering if steel would be more apt towards corrosion rather than aluminum (e.g. errants rocks that chip paint and the frame)? Maybe it's not an issue. I ride a Ti road bike and a Carbon fiber mountain, so it's never been a problem for me?
Ti or Carbon fiber would be a nice compromise, but it's more spendy than I'd prefer at this point. I'm thinking Lemond Poprad (True Temper steel) vs. Bianchi Axis or Kona JTS (Easton Ultralite).
I'm in a relatively small town in western Colorado without a whole lot of opportunity to demo, so...what do ya'll think? Supple ride of steel at expense of corrosion potential vs. more rigid ride of Aluminum at expense of ride quality???
10-26-04, 08:52 PM
vs. rigid ride of aluminum with benefit of corrosion resistance.
10-26-04, 09:11 PM
I have an 80s Colnago steel Cx bike that hasn't shown any problems yet. It may depend on where it lives when not in use. I have a heated & insulated garage. Don
10-26-04, 09:15 PM
i have an axis and have been using it as you describe and it's already picking up some scratches after barely a month of use. actually with the carbon fork it's really not that harsh of a ride. i love it but already want a compact dbl(or maybe even single) instead of the stock triple.
if i was gonna go steel i'd look into a Soulcraft frame.
if i could get anything it'd a moots ti...
But I'm wondering if steel would be more apt towards corrosion rather than aluminum (e.g. errants rocks that chip paint and the frame)? Maybe it's not an issue.Not even an issue on the outside of the frame. Spray the inside with JP Weigle's Framesaver before you build it and don't even worry about it. Most people don't even own frames long enough to worry about this stuff.
Steel is real man, steel is real. On the cheap, look at the Surly Crosscheck framset, or a Soma Fabrications Double Cross.
10-27-04, 08:02 AM
My 85 nashbar is rusting in places that were scraped to the frame years ago but it is purely cosmetic and that is after 20 years! If you get a scratch through the paint just touch it up with some colored nail polish and then over with nail hardner and that will prevent any corrosion. Or like others have said don't worry about it. imo steel is a better cx bike.
Me thinks that with the larger volume tires (in relation to a road bike) on a cross machine, frame material doesn't matter much in terms of ride quality.
Hardly, try the difference between a steel and Al mountain bike.
Today I rode my rain bike. I purchased this steel frame new 28 years ago. Rode the snot out of it thru high school and college. Retired it fourteen years ago only to build it up as a rain bike this fall. Iíve ridden It on the road, fire trails, and singletrack in the last month and still canít get it to fail. I also own two steel mountain bikes that are 18 years old. These are still doing quite well.
Iíll hand my Ti hardtail down to my kids.
Steel is great if built well. Before you go for a steel frame think aobut aluminum. Newer Al frmes, combined with nice carbon forks are really not that bad for riding CX. Frame manufacturers have already realized the potential benefits of the steel and quite a few of them have tried to develop new Al alloys that are sometimes close to the feel of the steel. OVerall Al has a huge benefit whe it comes to rust becasue it doesn't rust. It is not resistant to the salt on the roads but the steel is not either. Ti is the one that is reisitant to both water and salt but it costs a lot. Compared to Al, I think that Ti comes closer to the feel of the steel. Yet, steel is real and we'll have to wait a long time till we get a non-steel frame with steel qualities.
In any event if you want to stick with the steel you can try Surly. Cheap frames, not the lightest but pretty decent. If you're patient look on the wb and you might find a sweet Italian steel CX frame. I found a year ago my Pinarello. Brand new, sitting in a warehouse, no buyer and it was on sale. Sweet deal for even sweeter CX frame.
Use a spray of frame saver (one of those wax based protective coats that you spray inside the frame tubes), then build the bike and there you have it. Make sure that you indeed apply a generous coat of frame saver inside your frame. Beware that frame saver stinks and it takes about 4-5 days for it to dry so be patient.
Hopefully you'll take your bike apart once a year to check, clean and lubircate everything and this would be also an opportunity to reapply the frame saver. The problem is that if some moisture stays inside some of the tubes it can corrode the frame and it can fail on you. I've seen ithappen but on a MTB. My friend used to ride his steel frame MTB everyehere (mud, water, snow... you name it) and eventually one of the chain stays broke due to corrosion inside the chainstay. Yet, steel used in bike frames is indeed high quality steel so it takes a much longer for it to corrode to the point of corrosion. I have a steel made MTB that I've ridden for nine years through mud, water, snow, salty roads... and it still serves me well. The frame was made of high quality tripple butted Tange Prestige tubes and I made sure I coat it with frame saver once a year.
The problem is that if it indeed gets rusty in one of the tubes, it's hard to tell how long it'll last. In many cases you actually don't know if it's rusty till the frame fails on you.
Overall, if you ride a steel in wet conditions make sure you wipe it off as soon as you roll into garage. Dry storage will help you with your frame and honestly it can last you many many years. Make sure you stray it with protective coat at least once a year and don't ever power wash it. Use a dry rug, perhaps a bit of soap and clean it with patientce.

"Written by County Comptroller Howard S. Weitzman Thursday, 04 June 2009 15:34
Healthcare issues have always been at the forefront of my policy initiatives, both as County Comptroller and during the 35 years spent in the healthcare field. Throughout my two terms, I have been a squeaky wheel when it comes to finding ways to trim the escalating costs of Nassau County’s health benefits. Several years ago I persuaded the County Legislature to eliminate the practice of offering two family health benefit policies to one family, to lengthen the number of years of employment required to vest lifetime retiree health benefits and to increase the health benefit buy back amount to encourage employees with other coverage options to drop County health benefits.
Last year County Executive Tom Suozzi and I released a report showing that the New York State Health Insurance Program (NYSHIP) was over-collecting premiums from local governments and had accumulated an excessive $540 million on top of statutory reserves. The State agreed and applied some of the excessive premium to keep the 2009 rate increase to an average 1 percent, instead of the 7 percent originally forecasted by NYSHIP. This effort saved Nassau County taxpayers approximately $11 million in health insurance premiums for 2009 and approximately $116 million for local schools and governments. I will also be working to recoup a portion of the excess NYSHIP premiums charged in prior years – an amount equal to $540 million statewide and $21 million for Nassau County, that could be made as a one month premium holiday for all NYSHIP participants. The vast majority of Nassau’s schools and local governments also participate in NYSHIP.
Recently I received an appointment to the New York State Health Insurance Program Participating Agency Advisory Council (PAAC). This is good news for taxpayers because now I will have the ear of the people who make the policies. Nassau County is the largest local government participating agency in NYSHIP and prior to my appointment, no one from Nassau County had served on the board! The Council also includes representatives from other participating agencies, such as local school districts. Nassau County Director of Risk Management John Brooks was also named to the PAAC.
As a member of this council I will continue my call (and the use of my squeaky wheel) for an outside review of NYSHIP because I believe there are many more opportunities for savings and I look forward to serving Nassau County.",en,reference

"Do I really require iPad, Tabs or Tablets for personal, business computing ?
Now just a few days back, I was out with my experience on my most recent purchase of Smartphone based on Android Technology. I had covered most of the things which I could and honestly, it has all been a positive experience for me till date. Almost 70% of my online tasks, I am able to complete it using my smartphone. The remaining tasks I am able to complete using my laptop. Now when you have both Smartphone + PC then do you really require anything like Tablets? Yes, what do you think? Everyday I come across with one or the other news on launch of new Tablets, the very popular Android Tablets. Android Tablets have been immensely popular off-late but I still haven’t been able to figure it out on the benefits of the same. Why would I ever require an Android Tablet or say, the so called iPad from Apple? What is the hype about?
For me, my decision to purchase any product is defined by three main factors – usage, benefits and pricing. Apart from the these three factors, there is hardly anything to think over at least, for me. Now, talking on the basis of same factors, starting from the use, yes..I can definitely use the same. Operating any Tablet is just like operating any PC wherein the major difference lies in the interface being provided to input data which is carried out via touchscreen interface. I have become quite used to this touchscreen interface though I still find it uncomfortable as opposed to the conventional typing. Looks nothing more than a style quotient..! So as far as the usage is concerned, I am ok with it. Next comes the benefits, well…it does look benefiting to me but I can enjoy similar benefits on my smartphone as well as my laptop. Moreover, I feel I can do a lot more on my PC than what I actually can do with Tablets. Also, I get this feeling that Tablets have been developed mostly to run cloud based applications as apart from the desktop PC. Running cloud based applications means that I need to have an active internet connection all the time or else I may not be able to make the most of it. Am I right?
iPads or Tablets both fall under the same category though the only difference lies in the branding and the available apps in their online store which is quite better for Apple iPad but not the same for Android Tablets. I also have been through the demos of both Apple iPads and Samsung Android Tablets (Galaxy Tab) and honestly, I was really impressed with both these products. But couldn’t make it sure if anyone should purchase either any of these products for the same reasons as mentioned above. And last but not the least, pricing does matter. Honestly, I find both these products expensive though I agree to the fact that Android tablets are quite cheaper than the Apple iPads. Even, there are cheapest Android Tablets around but again the same question arises plus there is nothing like compromising with the quality and the required features. What say ??
Well whatever one may feel or say, personally I feel that it is more of a style quotient than anything else. Of course, one may benefit from the same when you see iPads or Tablets being ultra-portable and so easy to use and operate. And unlike what I have been reading in recent news, Tablets have slowed down PC Sales, I am yet to find truth in the same and still being gripped with the same dilemma – Should I go for anything like iPad or Tablet…!",en,web
"It happens during coaching changes, one of the aspects of the business.
The outgoing coach assembles a recruiting class but the incoming coach has other players in mind. Butch Jones left Cincinnati for Tennessee and when Tommy Tuberville replaced Jones, he wanted to bring recruits with him, especially at quarterback.
That left Massillon (Ohio) native Kyle Kempt high and dry. Most quarterbacks are done with recruiting well before National Signing Day and Kempt was no exception — he picked the Bearcats nearly a year ago. This late in the recruiting cycle, there are few scholarships left for quarterbacks at BCS schools. So if the school you're committed to has a coaching change, it can leave a recruit like Kempt with few options.
This weekend, Kempt might have found an even better home than Cincinnati. Oregon State was nationally ranked in the 2012 season and in the Pac-12, a better conference than the Big East. Kempt got his last-second offer and committed on the spot.
Wanna thank God through all this, I'm keeping the orange and black and committing to Oregon State! Go Beavs!— Kyle Kempt (@KyleKempt) Jan. 27, 2013
Before picking Cincinnati, Kempt had offers from Indiana, Ole Miss, Tennessee, West Virginia, Toledo and Bowling Green — but many of those options dried up months ago after he picked the Bearcats.
Kempt broke down his strengths to Sporting News in an interview given last year.
""There are a couple common things colleges are impressed with when they break down my film,"" Kempt told Sporting News. ""They like that I have a strong arm, make good decisions with the football, I'm accurate with my throws and I have a good pocket presence … Being a student of the game, studying film constantly, that's a strength. I’m going to hurt defenses through the air with accuracy and smart decision making.""",en,web
"Playing Fantasy Football does not qualify you to be the in the front office or on the coaching staff of the Pittsburgh Steelers. They are professionals and you are not!
I was under the impression that the Steelers don't negotiate during the season...so I wonder what this is really all about...
I wouldn't be opposed to signing a short contract on the cheap....Its good to have depth at RB.
Otherwise let him walk...
There's no talk of actual contract negotiations taking place- just a committment to have contract negotiations.
Schiavone's Race Career:
I have zero issue with Mendenhall being resigned. He's not going to be expensive, has the physical intangibles and if he's used properly could be a really good HB for the Steelers for another 3 to 4 years depending on the deal. Get a full back out in front and let the guy build up some rhythm and he's the tailback we need. I'm of the opinion that it's possible he was brought back too soon or expected to carry the load too soon. He came back and ran REALLY well, then had a stinker followed by putting the ball on the ground. Tomlin threw him immediately in the dog house which is fine but I feel like he's been in extended stay when it should have been a night at holiday inn express. I'd much rather sign him than go to the draft. Mendenhall, Dwyer and Redman looks a-okay to me. Plus Rainey for the speed infusion but I'd prefer to see him start lining up as a receiver more or get motioned out.",en,web
"Protecting your skin in the winter
WTOP's Randi Martin
Randi Martin, wtop.com
WASHINGTON - More than cold weather can damage your face and hands in the winter.
""The sun damages the skin in the winter, the wind dries it out and the heating systems in our homes and businesses add to that damage,"" says Maral Skelsey, an assistant professor at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital.
Though the sun may not shine brightly in the winter, Skelsey advises to wear sunscreen.
""The long wave lengths of light that are apparent in the winter penetrate deep into the skin and could promote aging and skin cancer,"" Skelsey says. ""The winter sun is actually damaging long term.""
Bundle up with hats, gloves and scarves, but stay away from wool. Skelsey says wool can aggravate already sensitive skin.
Indoor care is also important for your skin. Invest in a lotion or moisturizer that is oil based instead of water based. The oil creates a protective layer that will help your skin retain moisture. Skelsey suggests putting on the lotion after a shower or bath.
And forget that hot shower after a day out in the cold. Even though it may make you feel better, it robs your skin of moisture.
Investing in a home or office humidifier that will put cool moist air back in the dry air is also a good idea.
As far as preventative skin care techniques like drinking water, Skelsey says it won't do much.
""It may be good for your overall health,"" she says, ""but it really doesn't have any impact on the skin.""

Hi, welcome to LEF!
A smile cost nothing, but gives so much.
It enriches those who receive it,without making poorer those who give.It takes but a moment, but the memoryof it sometimes lasts forever.
None is so rich or mighty that hecan get along without it,and none is so poor but thathe can be made rich by it.
A smile creates happiness in the home,fosters goodwill in business,and is the countersign of friendship.
It brings rest to the weary,cheer to the discouraged, sunshine to the sad,and it is nature's best antidote for trouble.
Yet it cannot be bought, begged, borrowed,or stolen, for it is something that is of novalue to anyone until it is given away.
Some people are too tired to give you a smile.Give them one of yours, as none needs a smileso much as he who has no more to give.

"Discover the cosmos! Each day a different image or photograph of our fascinating universe is featured, along with a brief explanation written by a professional astronomer.
2010 August 12
Explanation: Each August, as planet Earth swings through dust trailing along the orbit of periodic comet Swift-Tuttle, skygazers can enjoy the Perseid Meteor Shower. The shower should build to its peak now, best seen from later tonight after moonset, until dawn tomorrow morning when Earth moves through the denser part of the wide dust trail. But shower meteors have been spotted for many days, like this bright Perseid streaking through skies near Lake Balaton, Hungary on August 8. In the foreground is the region's Church of St. Andrew ruin, with bright Jupiter dominating the sky to its right. Two galaxies lie in the background of the wide-angle, 3 frame panorama; our own Milky Way's luminous arc, and the faint smudge of the more distant Andromeda Galaxy just above the ruin's leftmost wall. If you watch for Perseid meteors tonight, be sure and check out the early evening sky show too, featuring bright planets and a young crescent Moon near the western horizon after sunset.

"Whitman College Book Arts Press
Mission: Preserve and regenerate the book art form.
The Whitman College Book Arts Press provides a unique opportunity for interdisciplinary collaboration which lends itself well to the liberal arts college atmosphere historically associated with Whitman College. Bookmaking is a fine art form that connects old and new technologies, particularly interesting to students.
The Whitman College Book Arts Press will preserve and regenerate the book art form through collaborative works, combining literature, visual art, typography, and printmaking in unique limited editions of fine art quality books, in a context that encourages and stimulates both student learning and public appreciation of the book arts and the preservation of book crafts, which are integrated into a multi-media and multi-disciplinary instructional context.
Book Arts at Whitman College
The Penrose Memorial Library at Whitman College has long held in its collection examples of fine art and archival books. The collection includes an original leaf from a Bible printed by Gutenberg circa 1455 as well as a complete copy of the Nuremberg Chronicle printed in 1493. Its archives include some 3,500 linear feet of historic documents and original letters.
One part of this collection is a collection of handsomely bound limited edition works from Frank McCaffrey's Dogwood Press. Born in 1898, McCaffrey had apprenticed in printing at the age of 10 in Spokane. He bought his first press in 1929, the Acme Press in Seattle. He operated his Dogwood Press on Battery Street in Seattle since 1952 gaining a reputation as a fine printer/craftsman. The 1975 donation of his press and equipment has provided the equipment base for Whitman College's Book Arts Press. It also led to a friendship between Larry Dodd, archivist at Penrose Library, which in turn permitted Mr. Dodd to acquire for the archives a representative collection of distinctive books printed with Mr. McCaffrey's fine touch at the Dogwood Press. From 1975 until 1987 the press equipment was used by the publications department which was then operated by S. Eugene Thompson at Whitman College. When Mr. Thompson departed the school, the equipment was no longer being used.
Mr. Dodd along with library director Henry Yaple approached Keiko Hara in the Art Department in 1987 wondering if students might benefit from access to a printing press in their design projects. The interdisciplinary effort linking literature and the visual arts through what was to become the Whitman Book Arts Press germinated at this time. In the early stages it amounted to art students and instructors learning about typography and incorporating it into design compositions and printmaking artwork. In order to get the press running, local printer Bob Graves volunteered his expertise.
The next step in Book Arts development came in the school year 1990-91 when the Art Department appointed Johnston Visiting Professor Byron Clercx with the specific intent that he develop book arts as part of his teaching duties. During this period the Library began collecting examples of contemporary fine art books created by professionals and by students.
In 1992-3 a faculty committee drawn from many disciplines was formed and began to develop a long-term strategy for the Book Arts Press. Representatives from the Library, the Art Department, as well as the arts and sciences and local printers who had served as technical resources participated in developing a strategy for funding and improving the printing facilities.
In the 1993-4 school year a student intern was assigned exclusively to bookmaking. Carrie Larson put together binding, typography, and card making projects for students in the community working with Keiko Hara. The following year Robert Oze served as a student intern exclusively assigned to the Book Arts Press as well. He continued in that capacity in the 1995-6 school year.
In the 1992-3 school year a visiting instructor, Susan Allen, Director of Library and Media Services at Kalamazoo College in Michigan, did a workshop with interested students and community members in which they produced a limited edition book. In the 1993-4 school year students had the opportunity to observe the collaborative efforts of Poet Sherman Alexie, artist James Lavador, and Typographer/Bookmaker Ben Trissel in the production of the limited edition book Seven Morning Songs I Have Yet to Learn to Play on My Cedar Flute. Some of these books are now in major collections including the Special Book Collection at the University of Washington. In the summer of 1995 a limited edition translation of a Tibetal Palmleaf Manuscript was produced by Barbara Tetenbaum, a visiting book artist from Oregon School of Arts and Crafts, with translation and concept direction from Whitman College Religion Professor Jonathan Walters.
In the fall of 1995 the college employed Arnold Visiting Professor Katherine Kuehn, a book artist who had recently left Pace Editions in New York to begin her independent book art press in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Her teaching duties were exclusively directed at teaching and promoting the book arts.
In the 1996-7 academic year the first Book Arts class was taught by Keiko Hara, Professor of Art at Whitman College. Inviting guest book artists Chris Stern and Jules Fay from Sedro-Wooley. Keiko Hara and her Book Arts class collaborated to produce a limited edition book with Northwest poet Tess Gallagher, who was the Arnold Visiting Professor that year.
In July 1997 the Art Department and Penrose Library, with the support of the Blue Mountain Arts Alliance, presented the first summer symposium and workshop ""A Contemporary Book Arts Perspective, The Private Life of Books."" Instructors included Sandra Kroupa, the University of Washington Book Arts Librarian, Katherine Kuehn, from Salient Seedling Press, Julia Chan, Flying Fish Press, Mills College, CA, Barbara Tetenbaum, Triangular Press from Oregon College of Arts and Crafts, and David Schlater, Educational Technologies Multi-media Designer from Idaho.
During 1997-1999, Anna Hepler, a visiting Book Artist who studied with Claire Van Vliet, came to Whitman to teach Book Arts classes. In 1998 the second annual summer symposium, ""Traditions in the Book Arts: Contemporary Explorations,"" was held, featuring presentations by Jim Dine, with Julia D'Amerio and Ruth Lingen from Pace Graphic Center in New York. Kathy Coddington and other intern students from the Art Department assisted in the collaboration, making proofs.
Other featured workshops were directed by Ruth Lingen, Director of the Spring Street Workshop at Pace in New York, John Carrera from Quercus Press, Anna Hepler of Beo Press, Visiting Book Artist at Whitman College, Kathy Kuehn, and Artist in Residence Laurie Chambers, from Seattle.
In 1999, the third annual summer symposium Book Arts workshop ""The Future is the Book,"" featured Gary Frost, a book conservator from Booklab, Inc, Barbara Henry, Director and Curator at Bowne and Co., at the South Street Seaport Museum in New York City, Barbara Tetenbaum and Kathy Kuehn led this intensive production of a limited edition artists' book.
During the fall 1999 a limited edition book Kali was completed and co-published with the Enitharmon Press in London.
Kathy Kuehn was instrumental in leading the annual summer symposiums and workshops, and Jim Dine's collaborative book.
From fall 1999 to present, David Wharton has been on the faculty of the Art Department as a Book Arts instructor. Using his background as the printmaking director at the Sun Valley Art Center, he has made many improvements to the Book Arts facilities and resources.
In Spring 2000 the Book Arts studio was moved to the expanded Olin Hall studio art wing from its previous location in North Hall. It was placed next to the printmaking studio and shares a much improved ventilation system. A new photo-polymer plate maker also allows the production of photographic and digital prints.",en,reference
"Guide to 5 Common Infant Infections
Symptoms, treatment and prevention of five common baby infections, including thrush, diaper rash and more
Every mom naturally frets when her little guy or gal suddenly sports a bumpy red rash or develops a worrisome temperature in the middle of the night. The early years bring on a number of skin woes, fevers, sniffles, and coughs, and there's often not much you can do to avoid them, besides being vigilant about hand washing and good hygiene. Thankfully, they're often short-lived and mild. You'll want to consult your pediatrician, but treatment, for the most part, is pretty simple, as well. ""The best care for most of these illnesses is often just supportive -- fever medication, extra fluids, and a little more rocking and snuggling,"" explains Jennifer Trachtenberg, M.D., New York City author of The Smart Parent's Guide to Getting Your Kids Through Checkups, Illnesses and Accidents.
What it is A yeast infection in and around your baby's mouth. Yeast occurs naturally and is usually harmless, but an overgrowth can cause an infection.
How it's transmitted Kissing, hugging, nursing, and bathing can pass yeast from mom to baby. It can also travel via bottles and pacifiers.
Symptoms Thick white patches that form on the gums, inner cheeks, tongue, and roof of the mouth. Feedings may be painful for your baby.
Treatment Your baby may need oral antifungal medication; an antifungal skin cream can be used on mom's nipples. Wash feeding equipment extra well; if the infection persists, consider tossing bottle nipples and pacifiers.
Yeast Diaper Infection
What it is This rash is also caused by the yeast in your baby's system.
How it's transmitted A wet diaper is a warm, moist place for fungus to grow. It can also travel from the baby's mouth down through the GI tract and then out with the stool.
Symptoms A garden-variety diaper rash will be a bit red and irritated, while a yeast infection is a lot angrier-looking, with shiny red, pustule-like bumps (though they aren't liquid-filled) that cluster in the groin area or skin folds. This rash may be tender to the touch, so expect some squirming on the changing table.
Treatment An antifungal cream, such as nystatin, will clear up a mild yeast infection.

Apple asks ITC to block import of HTC handsets in latest patent complaintApple has filed a new patent complaint with the U.S. International Trade Commission, asking it once again to block the import of hardware made by rival smartphone maker HTC.
The complaint was filed with the ITC on July 8, and was revealed through a notice on its official website posted Monday. As noted by Bloomberg, the nature of the complaint was not revealed in the notice, and the document is not yet available to view.
The new complaint, numbered 2828, is categorized with ""Portable Electronic Devices and Related Software."" Named as proposed respondents are HTC Corp., of China., HTC America Inc. of Bellevue, Wash.
Asking the ITC to ban the import of devices is standard practice when a lawsuit is filed. Similar motions were made in legal spats Apple has had with Nokia and Samsung.
Apple first sued HTC in the ITC in March of 2010, and accused the Taiwanese company of infringing on 20 patents related to the iPhone's user interface, underlying architecture and hardware. In a statement, Apple co-founder Steve Jobs said though competition is ""healthy,"" competitors should not ""steal"" Apple's technology.
Though the suit was directed at HTC, the complaint specifically targeted a number of phones that run Google's Android mobile operating system, leading many to believe the real purpose of the complaint was to serve as a warning shot toward Google. For its part, HTC fired back with its own lawsuit, accusing Apple of infringing on five patents.
The first complaint filed by Apple against HTC is set to be decided on by a judge on Aug. 5. The findings will the be subject to review by the full commission.
HTC saw an early victory in the case in April, when the ITC staff voiced it support for the company as the trial began. The staff made the non-binding recommendation in favor of HTC, but the actual ruling will be made by ITC Administrative Law Judge Carl Charneski next month, and will then be reviewed by the six-member commission.

"Speaking in Parliament on Wednesday (12 October), Barroso unveiled proposals aimed at breaking ""the vicious cycle of uncertainty over sovereign debt sustainability"".
Barroso admitted that since the sub-prime crisis in the US developed into a world crisis, the EU had come up with different initiatives, which now need to be put together and streamlined.
The five elements of the roadmap he presented were interdependent and must be implemented simultaneously, he insisted.
The five elements are helping to solve the problems of cash-strapped Greece, strengthen the euro area, strengthen the banking system through recapitalisation, pursue growth policies and build stronger economic governance.
Barroso called on Slovakia, the only country that has failed to ratify the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), to do so in a second round of voting this week.
""I call upon all parties in the Slovak Parliament to rise above the positioning of short term politics, and seize the next opportunity to ensure a swift adoption of the new agreement,"" Barroso stated.
Regarding the EFSF itself, he said that the fund should be ""more than a firewall"" and that its capacity should be ""maximised"". He made it clear that banks in need of recapitalisation should use private resources of capital first. The next step would be the national governments to provide support, while EFSF funds should be used only as a last resort.
On bank recapitalisation and in light of the unconvincing stress tests carried out recently, Barroso pleaded that banks which do not have the required capital should be prevented from paying out dividends and bonuses.
Many proposals to come
Barroso referred to ""project bonds"", which were announced in his 2011 State of the Union speech, saying the Commission will table its proposal next week. A proposal for ""stability bonds"", sometimes called ""Eurobonds"", which were also mentioned in his speech, will follow by the end of the year, he said.
On economic governance, Barroso announced that proposals would be made soon to improve crisis management between the European Commission, the EU Council of Ministers and the Eurogroup.
National budgetary policies of member countries with excessive debt should be monitored under a procedure which should allow the EU to intervene, he said, adding that his services would make a proposal to the Council and Parliament.
Putting aside ideological differences
The Presidents of the four major groups in parliament – the centre-right EPP, the Socialists and Democrats, the ALDE liberals and the Green/EFA group published a rare joint statement, in which they said they were putting aside ""any ideological differences"", and called for a joint plan, largely reflecting the Commission's proposals.
A joint resolution in that sense is due to be approved by Parliament today (13 October).
Barroso made his proposals in Parliament with the clear design to strengthen his position ahead of a crucial EU and eurozone summit on 23 October.
However, analysts say he may face resistance among member states, which are reluctant to put up more money in projects such as ""maximising"" the EFSF.",en,web

- Created 15 October 2010; Published 1 November 2010Convocation: R. Dale Guthrie
Professor emeritus at the Institute of Arctic Biology at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, R. Dale Guthrie is a renowned paleobiologist and artist. His many books and papers have covered a wide range of interests, including evolutionary dwarfing, social anatomy, causes of extinctions, climatic change and human evolution. In the past few decades his lifelong hunting experience and hobbies of painting and sculpting have dovetailed with his scientific interests, leading to his landmark study, The Natural History of Paleolithic Art.
Prior to Guthrie's book there was no widespread practice of using information and ideas from natural history and studies of human universals in approaching the thousands of art images made by members of Eurasian Ice Age bands. The cave paintings and other preserved remnants of Paleolithic peoples shed light on a world little known to us. With a natural historian's keen eye for observation, and as one who has spent a lifetime using bones and other excavated materials to piece together past human behavior and environments, Guthrie demonstrates that Paleolithic art is a mode of expression we can comprehend to a remarkable degree and that the perspective of natural history is integral to that comprehension. He employs a mix of ethology, evolutionary biology, and human universals, along with innovative forensic techniques, to access these distant cultures and their art and artifacts.
The title of Dr. Guthrie's presentation was ""Evolution of Art, Morality, and Romantic Love in the Ice Age Human Band.""

Daniel Seddiqui has recently completed his mission to work 50 different jobs in 50 states. He has been everything from a rodeo announcer in South Dakota, a model in North Carolina, a marine biologist in Washington, to a border patrol agent in Arizona. Why would anyone put themselves through such a grueling experience? Seddiqui's goal was to help Americans understand each other's lives, respect each other's hard work and stimulate peoples' curiosity about different lifestyles. Unaware of what life was like outside his ""bubble"", he was on a mission to explore the many careers, environments, and cultures that America has to offer. To explore the lifestyle that each state has to offer, he chose one career per state – a career that is popular and represented that state. Through his website Livingthemap.com, Seddiqui chronicled his cross-country adventure, as he worked as an insurance broker in Connecticut, a golf caddie in Hawaii, a sugar maker in Vermont, and an auto mechanic in Michigan, just to name a few of his many 'professions'.

- Created 26 February 2010; Published 5 March 2010Convocation: Patrice Gaines
Patrice Gaines is an award winning journalist and former Washington Post reporter who has proven that you cannot judge a book by its cover. She grew up a self-hating young woman, entering one abusive relationship after another. She became a heroin user, went to prison for possession of the drug and was raped and beaten before she began her long contemplative journey to change. She later began her journalism career at the Miami News, and worked for sixteen years as a reporter with the Washington Post, where she carved a niche for herself focusing on human-interest stories that reflected current issues. During this time she spent six years researching a notorious Washington, D.C. murder for which eight young men remain incarcerated. Her work on the story raised serious doubts about the guilt of the youths and showed readers the absolute power wielded by police and prosecutors. This story plus her own experience with the judicial and penal systems sparked her to begin speaking on the states of those systems today, including the high rate of incarceration among minorities and the poor, questionable police practices, prosecutors with too much power, and the weeding out of bad lawyers. She also offers an engaging look at the power of the press, told from an insider point of view. The title of her presentation was ""How We Can All Be Free: Prison Reform in the 21st Century.""

• Earn double points.
• The “wildcard” gem. This can be matched with any gem, regardless of color!
Effects can be stacked, so you can even use two of the same item at once to double its effect. There are also super special items like Garfield's Paws, Odie's Super Run, and Garfield loves Pooky, and each can give you an even bigger advantage!

|_Attribute.Invoke||Provides access to properties and methods exposed by an object. (Inherited from Attribute.)|
The scope of the declaration that is allowed depends on the SecurityAction that is used.
The security information declared by a security attribute is stored in the metadata of the attribute target and is accessed by the system at run time. Security attributes are used only for declarative security. For imperative security, use the corresponding permission class.
Starting with the .NET Framework 4, identity permissions are not used.
In the .NET Framework versions 1.0 and 1.1, identity permissions cannot have an Unrestricted permission state value. Starting with the .NET Framework version 2.0, identity permissions can have any permission state value. This means that in 2.0 and later versions, identity permissions have the same behavior as permissions that implement the IUnrestrictedPermission interface.
By default, code access security does not check for Publisher evidence. Unless your computer has a custom code group based on the PublisherMembershipCondition class, you can improve performance by bypassing Authenticode signature verification. This is accomplished by configuring the runtime to not provide Publisher evidence for code access security. For more information about how to configure this option and which applications can use it, see the <generatePublisherEvidence> element.

"Ready? Set? Mark your ballot
It’s that time of the year again! Prognosticators are predicting a federal election. Yes, it looks like we’ll be heading to the ballot boxes in the spring of 2007.
People with arthritis who depend on medications to maintain their quality of life will be interested in federal issues relating to the National Pharmaceutical Strategy (NPS) and Cross Boarder Internet Pharmacy (CBIP). The CAPA Steering Committee will be developing election messages to address the issues that will state what we need as patients/consumers and what we expect of candidates to win our vote. As readers of CAPA Voices know, the NPS is part of a 10-year plan to strengthen Canada’s healthcare system. Initially nine priorities were identified and they have been narrowed to five focus areas. They are:
- “Real World” drug safety and effectiveness
- Expensive drugs for rare diseases
- Drug pricing and purchasing
- Catastrophic drug coverage
- Common drug formulary
NPS strategy development involves Health Ministers from each province and is lead by representatives from British Columbia – a province with a poor reputation for reviewing and listing drugs on the provincial formulary. Although the development team states that consumers must be involved in the process, little is known about the status of the work currently being studied and consumers are not involved in the process. Both Dr. Kathy Kovacks Burns and Linda Wilhelm have written articles on the NPS. These appear in the March and June 2006 editions respectively.
Little has been written about CBIP in the last year. We had hoped that this matter had been resolved and no longer a threat to the Canadian supply of medications, however it has surfaced again. With the mid term election in the U.S., we saw the Democrats win control of the Senate which will allow them to fulfill a campaign promise to ensure Americans have access to affordable medications. If they win a majority in the 2008 election, CBIP will again be a threat to our supply of medications. CBIP is addressed in this issue of CAPA Voices by Linda Wilhelm. It was also addressed in the article, Canada cannot be the drugstore for the United States, in December 2004 edition.
Some provinces will also be heading to the polls in 2007. While provincial issues vary from province to province, many transcend provincial borders such as listing new drugs on provincial formularies, accessing drugs once they are listed, patient consumer involvement in research and policy decisions, and timely access to health care services and professionals.
Over the past few years CAPA has collaborated with the membership to develop important election messages and coordinate awareness strategies. We’ll do it again for the 2007 election and we urge you to become involved. Begin the process and become election-ready by telling us your healthcare concerns. We need to hear from you. What do you want your candidates to know?
Please share your thoughts on our discussion board.",en,web
"Growing ties between Turkey, China, Iran worry Israel and U.S. - Haaretz Daily Newspaper | Israel News
Turkey held military drill with China, after canceling with Israel; cooperation also reflected in weapons deals, with Iran buying from China mainly missile technology.
By Anshel Pfeffer
The United States and Israel are watching with concern the growing military cooperation among Turkey, China and Iran, especially following a joint Turkish-Chinese air-force exercise last week.
Until two years ago Israel was Turkey's main partner for air combat training.
In 2001 the Turkish air force inaugurated a tactical air warfare center in Konya with Israel and the United States.
Until 2008 the Israel Air Force was a frequent guest in Turkey's sky and a regular participant in the country's big annual exercise, Anatolian Eagle.
In the wake of Operation Cast Lead and the subsequent deterioration of bilateral relations Turkey last year revoked Israel's participation in the maneuvers. The United States decided not to take part in the exercise this year because of that decision. A number of other NATO members followed suit.
Turkey replaced the Israel Air Force with its Chinese counterpart. China sent Sukhoi SU-27 fighter aircraft and pilots to train with Turkey's F-16 fighters. In the past these exercises were held in relatively openness, but last week they were held covertly, with only a brief report appearing in the Turkish media after the exercise.
The West has been watching the changes in the Chinese army's structure, and especially the long-range naval and aerial exercises that indicate Beijing's intention to acquire the ability to conduct warfare far from China's borders.
The Chinese are also aggressively pursuing cyber warfare capabilities, employing some 60,000 hackers at it, according to foreign intelligence reports.
The Obama administration protested Turkey's military cooperation with Iran after it was reported that the Chinese fighter planes were sent to Turkey via Pakistan and Iran.
The developing ties among Turkey, Iran and China are also reflected in weapons deals, with Iran buying from China mainly missile technology.
The C-802 antiship missile fired by Hezbollah in the Second Lebanon War at the Israel Navy's Hanit missile boat was manufactured in Iran with Chinese technology.
China has also developed a surface-to-surface rocket-launching system together with Turkey. China's Prime Minister Wen Jiabao is due to visit Ankara this month and to sign several bilateral cooperation agreements.
Turkey and China are also involved in projects to build oil pipelines from Iran.
Another reason for the close relations between the two states is that China, as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, has been in the forefront of opposition to imposing harsher sanctions on Iran in connection to the Islamic state's nuclear program.",en,web
"As a freshman last season she advanced to the state finals in a pair of individual events, a pair of relays, and was a star on an always stout Alpharetta swim team.
Having already qualified for this year’s state meet in her four individual events — 200 freestyle, 100 butterfly, 100 freestyle, and 50 freestyle — Bordes’ sophomore season is shaping up to be even better.
“She has been a great leader for us this year and has legitimately stepped up for us every time she has gotten on the block to race,” said Alpharetta swim coach Emily Santowski, who has known Bordes since she coached the speedy sophomore as an 8-year old.
“She’s just a racer, you give her a challenge and she is going to step up and knock it out. I feel comfortable putting her in the pool in any race, any relay or any stroke.”
Bordes will return to the state championship pool at Georgia Tech in early February looking to build on her impressive list of accomplishments.
“The goals for her are top 8 in those events and we’re looking forward to seeing what she can do. She’s only a sophomore and her future in this sport is very bright.”",en,web
"Americans, who have been receiving lots of press as the planet’s fattest people, seem willing to try anything when it comes to losing weight. The American Dietetic Association (ADA), a Chicago-based organization of some 70,000 food and nutrition professionals, says our appetites now fuel a $30-billion industry of weight-loss products and programs. And none of them has been receiving as much attention lately as the high-protein, low-carbohydrate regimen that’s the basis for such popular diets as the Atkins or the Zone.
Jim Ramer, a commercial production assistant in Sarasota, recently tried the Atkins diet; he says in two and a half weeks, 14 pounds melted off his body like the butter he was eating every day. Sarasota marketing rep Kathy Bell lost 10 pounds in just a few weeks by following the same routine.
""The Atkins diet and the Zone have been getting a lot of attention because they refute the former diets that support a low-fat, moderate-high carbohydrate diet,"" says Grace Lee, a registered dietictan at Doctors Hospital here in Sarasota. ""Even more so, they permit dieters to eat foods high in fat, like bacon, sausage, cheese, meat, eggs and ribs, which is very enticing.""
This is in sharp contrast to the Food and Drug Administration’s official food ""pyramid,"" which suggests that the average diet consist of 65 percent carbohydrates, 15 percent fat and 20 percent protein. But many critics say that with obesity bloating to epidemic proportions, Americans need to reconsider those proportions, particularly the recommended percentage of carbohydrates. Since the human body gets its fuel from only two places-fat stores and glucose-proponents of low carbohydrate diets argue that by restricting carbohydrates (which break down into glucose), you’re removing one of those sources. This forces your body into a state called ""ketosis"" where it will burn fat instead.
During the initial ""induction"" phase of Atkins, carbohydrates are limited to 20 grams a day (an amount you can rack up in one peanut butter cup, a six-inch banana, or half a medium-sized bagel). After that, they are restricted to no more than 60. This is substantially below the recommended dietary allowance of 130 grams a day, and light years behind a man’s average daily intake of 200 to 330 and woman’s 180 to 230.
According to the Atkins Web site, if you’re trying to lose a great deal of weight, you can continue this ""induction"" phase for six months or more, but Laura McLeroy, a registered dietitian for Sarasota Memorial Hospital, doesn’t suggest that. She says such an abrupt and drastic decline in carbohydrates burns more than fat. ""Ketosis tends to burn out the kidneys,"" she says-something Atkins continues to deny. ""The kidneys filter products out of the body, and if they’re forced to filter excess fats and proteins, it can be damaging over the long term."" And despite what their literature says, McLeroy insists that, ""Ketosis does burn muscle.""
Not true, says Colette Heimowitz, director of education and research for Atkins. ""Only when your body is not getting enough protein will it go to muscle,"" she says. ""The Atkins protocol projects 30-to 35-percent protein, and if you’re getting enough calories from protein and fat, your body will not burn muscle in ketosis.""
Another thing McLeroy doesn’t like about Atkins and other low-carb diets is that they tend to exclude fruit and vegetables, which are great sources of the vitamins, minerals and antioxidants we need to stay healthy.
""I missed fruit the most,"" says Bell, who tried the diet a second time to lose eight more pounds. She finally stopped after it left her too weak to complete her daily exercise regimen. ""No matter what the books say, and I’ve read all of them, I followed the program exactly and was still too tired,"" she says.
Low-carb diets are also expensive, says Ramer. Because Atkins in particular requires substantial amounts of protein, Ramer says he was spending a lot more at the grocery store for steaks and meat. ""It’s too much meat,"" says Bell, who is now following a traditional low-calorie diet.
What people considering a low-carb diet need to know, says McLeroy, is that there are two kinds of carbohydrates: simple and complex. Humans do tend to digest ""simple"" carbs, like fruits and starches that contain sugar, much faster than we do ""complex"" carbs like whole grains and beans, that contain more fiber. And faster digestion of simple sugars does stimulate higher insulin production, something the Zone and Atkins proponents say can cause mood swings and weight gain.
Lee and McLeroy warn against avoiding all carbohydrates, because high-fiber vegetables, such as lettuce and broccoli (yes, these vegetables do contain carbohydrates) have more fiber, vitamins and nutrients, and are associated with lower rates of hypertension, cancer, arthritis and diabetes. Low-fiber carbohydrates like bananas are high in potassium, and tomatoes are rich in vitamins and linked to the prevention of prostate cancer.
A more sensible approach, says Lee, is to monitor the types of carbohydrates you eat.
To further complicate the issue, individuals process the same carbohydrates differently. ""Some people break down the glucose created by a potato faster than they do pure sugar,"" says McLeroy. ""You can control what you eat, but you can’t control what your body’s going to do with it. I may eat a baked potato and nothing happens; you may eat one and your blood sugar will skyrocket.""
Even so, she says, ""I tell all my clients that at the end of the day, a carbohydrate is a carbohydrate."" After digestion, both kinds are absorbed into the body as glucose. The trick is to eat foods (like high-fiber complex carbohydrates) that release insulin at a more moderate pace.
Most nutritionists agree that carbohydrates themselves are not the problem as much as refined starches like pasta, white bread, crackers, white rice and corn flakes. Replacing carbohydrates with large amounts of fats and proteins is a dangerous recipe for raising your risk of heart disease and several types of cancer. Plus, both the Atkins and Zone diets encourage the use of supplements, and even sell them on their Web sites. The ADA’s official stance is that any diet that requires supplements is by definition unbalanced.
McLeroy believes that diets like Atkins can work. ""But only in the short term,"" she says. ""If you have more than 10 pounds to lose, it’s probably not a good idea.""
Lee is not as generous. ""Any diet that eliminates or drastically reduces entire macronutrients or multiple food groups.cannot be considered safe for the long-run or even the short-term,"" she says. ""These diets, along with 90 percent of the diets, do not work. In fact, they can do more harm and lead to yo-yo weight loss and gain.""
Ramer can attest to that. After religious adherence to 21 grams of carbs a day, his weight loss ended after two and a half weeks with a big, fat submarine sandwich. ""Screw this,"" Ramer remembers saying. ""I want the sandwich."" And how long did it take him to gain back those 14 pounds? ""I put it all on quite quickly after I went off the diet,"" he says.
""Well, of course, you’re going to put it back on after you stop the diet,"" counters Atkins’ Heimowitz. ""If you go from 20 carbs a day back to 150, you will definitely gain weight back again."" She adds, ""Dr. Atkins never intended for people to give up carbohydrates entirely. That’s a misconception and does a disservice to the entire program.""
Atkins sources admit its eating plan has consequences. The Web site warns dieters about dramatic diuretic effects, dangerously low blood sugar levels in diabetics who are taking medication, and possible overdoses in people who are taking medicine to control their blood pressure.
""It is a diet that I would not recommend to anyone, no exceptions,"" says Lee. The Zone diet, however, is a different matter. While she declines to promote it, Lee says the Zone is more balanced because it does not have as great a proportion of calories coming from protein and fat. It also encourages exercise and the consumption of monounsaturated fats, the healthiest form for humans.
McLeroy says the Zone, with its emphasis on exact ratios of 40 percent carbohydrates, 30 percent protein and 30 percent fat, is very popular with her eating disorder patients. (The Zone advocates lean protein and natural carbohydrates like fruits and fiber-rich vegetables.)
And even the Institute of Medicine (IOM), a branch of the National Academy of Science, is rethinking our intake of carbs. Last September, the IOM issued a new dietary report that increases the recommended daily levels of fat and protein and reduces carbohydrates to those very near the Zone. It’s also promoting the idea that people should be eating appropriately for their lifestyle.
""Weight loss is very specific,"" says McLeroy. ""Sometimes people are eating great, they just need to watch their portions or exercise.""
""Marathon runners have a much higher proportion of muscle to fat,"" adds Lee. ""These runners are calorie-burning furnaces. As a result, they can eat many more calories than the same individual who has a high body-fat content, even though they may be the same weight.""
Lee says any excess calorie that cannot be expended is stored as fat. ""Any diet, if it is lower in calories than what one can burn off, will make you lose weight, whether that calorie is from fat, protein or carbohydrate.""
And ultimately, says McLeroy, ""The slower you lose weight, the more likely you are to keep it off,"" she says.
But to the normally 185-pound (five-foot, eight-inch) Ramer, the lure of instant gratification is just too tempting. He admits he went back on the diet in January to drop more weight for his April wedding.
A Grain of Truth
The trick to eating carbohydrates and avoiding weight gain is choosing the right kind.
If you’re confused about how to tell a good grain from a bad, just remember one word: whole. Whole grains have not been milled, so they retain the bran and germ that are rich in fiber, B-vitamins and minerals. Products made with whole wheat taste better and are more filling.
And don’t be fooled by labels. Breads often list ""wheat flour,"" ""unbalanced wheat"" and ""stoned wheat"" in their ingredients. They’re healthier if they’ve been made with ""whole grain"" or ""whole wheat.""
Some examples of whole wheat products are: brown rice, corn (despite what the low-carbohydrate crowd claims), whole oats, buckwheat and millet.
For a complete nutritional breakdown of every food, head to the USDA Web site http://www.nal.usda.gov/fnic/cgi-bin/nut_search.pl.
The Asian Model
Lowering carbohydrate intake is earning respect in scientific circles. Researchers from Cornell and Harvard University, along with the Oldways Preservation and Exchange Trust, a non-profit think tank, devised an eating plan based entirely on the Asian food model.
These Asian-influenced diets embrace rice products, noodles, breads and whole grains, fruits, vegetables, legumes (beans), nuts and seeds. They also recommend physical activity, plant-based fluids, like tea, even sake, beer and wine. They recommend small daily servings of low-fat dairy products and red meat once a month. These diets distinguish between animal and plant protein and fats and oils that the FDA food pyramid lumps together, even though nutritionists agree that protein in plants is different from that in animals, and that some fat is healthy and necessary.
Lee explains: ""Western diets tend to be high in meat, dairy and fat. Asian diets tend to be high in vegetables, grains, soy, fish, and low in meat, dairy and high-fat desserts such as pastries, pies and cookies. Meat in Asian diets is used more as a side, not a main entrée. Rarely do you find a big 16-ounce steak on the dinner plate of an Asian consumer in their country."" (However, when Asian societies adopt Western eating habits, they’re also inheriting Western disease and weight gain.)",en,web

"Michigan could end 'spoiled' elections with instant runoff voting
By Douglas Campbell
Published November 14th 2006 in The Detroit News
'Tis November. Leaves are falling, Lucy snatched the football away from Charlie Brown, and Democrats are whining that the Green Party spoiled an election.
In the election for the Michigan Senate, Republican John Pappageorge, Democrat Andy Levin and Green Kyle McBee each received a minority of the vote in District 13, which covers part of Oakland County. Pappageorge received a plurality -- more votes than anybody else -- and will be the district's senator. Democrats say that because Levin and McBee, combined, received more votes than Pappageorge, Levin should get the Senate seat.
I understand their disappointment, after spending close to a $1 million campaigning for this one Senate seat, including $364,600 of soft money from the Senate Democratic Fund, a similar amount from political action committees and much of the remainder from lawyers and chief executives (for a job that pays $79,650 a year).
Minority votes don't win
Correct me if I'm clueless here: Which part of receiving a minority of the vote entitles you to expect to win? Some are howling that the election was ""spoiled"" because ""the left"" was divided between Democrats and Greens, and ""the right"" won the Senate seat.
I don't see it as spoiled so much as the inevitable outcome of our first-past-the-post style of elections. Somebody wins, everybody else loses. If you earn a minority of the vote, you should expect to lose.
Our system doesn't allocate 3 percent of the seats in Congress to parties that receive 3 percent of the vote, or there would be three Green senators and 13 Green representatives in Washington, D.C.
McBee accepted no soft money, corporate contributions or PAC money. It's the Green Party way - we have unilaterally implemented campaign finance reform and remain 100-percent lobbyist-free. Almost everyone wants to see obscene sums of money out of political campaigning and we have formed a new political party that does precisely that.
But because McBee spent less than 1 percent of what Levin did advertising in media outlets, he encountered a near-perfect news blackout from those media outlets.
Green's campaign reforms
Yes, the Green Party has a plan for campaign finance reform. We may be best known for protecting and restoring the natural environment, but becoming active in politics is necessary to achieve that. Wangari Maathai, recipient of the 2004 Nobel Peace Prize and the founder of the Green Belt Movement in Kenya, probably says it best:
""It is very, very important for the world to recognize the linkage between good management of the environment, sustainable and efficient management of our environment and resources, and equitable distribution of these resources on one side, and democratic space and peace. If we are going to manage our resources sustainability, efficiently, if we are going to share them equitably, we need democratic space. It is impossible to manage resources responsibly and sustainably in a dictatorship, because in such a situation you have a few people controlling the resources at the expense of the many, and therefore, you cannot have peace. Sooner or later, you have conflict.""
Try new voting system
The United States may not be a dictatorship, but we do have a few people controlling the resources at the expense of the many.
We have a plan for eliminating spoiled elections, too: Instant Runoff Voting, which we've been promoting since day one. Under this system, you mark both your first and second choices. It makes it unnecessary to choose the lesser of two weasels, enables you to mark both your true preference and your fallback choice, mathematically eliminates the possibility of spoiled elections, eliminates the need for primary elections and assures no candidate is elected without a majority.
We just haven't found anybody in the Legislature who's interested in preventing spoiled elections.
The Green party is not going away, and we're not giving up. We're trying to bring true democracy to America, not just a pendulum swinging between Democrats and Republicans. A nation accustomed to 31 flavors of ice cream needs much more than just two bipolar political parties.
Ideally, we'd have at least five strong political parties, no two of which can form a majority. But just having one or two strong minor parties, which could prevent one traditional party or the other from gaining and abusing a majority, would be a great start.",en,web
"Sprint is now offering customers the option to purchase a personalized name to use instead of their traditional 10-digit phone number. The feature, called StarStar Me, was launched on Monday and costs $2.99 a month per number.
With StarStar Me, customers can choose a full name, nickname or just a favorite word to be used as an alternative to their number. As the name of the feature implies, customers must type in the star symbol twice followed by the word in order to make a call to one of these vanity numbers. For example, if you claimed the word ""Sasha,"" the full number would be ""**SASHA,"" or more accurately, ""**72742.""
“Sprint customers will be the first people to get StarStar Me,” said Kevin McGinnis, VP-product and technology development for Sprint. “We expect this service to be especially popular with professionals, students and family customers, who can tailor its use to their individual preferences, lifestyles and interests with a few simple clicks.”
StarStar Me is clearly based on the vanity license plate model, but the question is whether there will be as much of a demand for it with cellphones as there is for cars.
On the one hand, having a vanity number might make it easier for friends and colleagues to remember your phone number — and it will look pretty good on a business card. On the flip side, you might end up being known as the person who pays $36 a year to force people to type your name on a keypad.

"""Risotto""is one of the most popular dish in Italian cuisine...so how can i miss it posting in my blog. So i am posting this mushroom risotto recipe today, which i prepare frequently...its a very simple and easy one.If you do not get arborio rice you can use short grained basmati rice instead. I have used mushroom soup powder which gives a very nice taste and even the flavor of mushroom is infused well.Give it a try and i am sure you will love it.
- 1 cup arborio rice(or short grain basmati rice)
- 3/4 cup chopped mushrooms
- 2-3 table spoon mushroom soup powder
- 1 small chopped onion
- 1 table spoon finely chopped garlic
- 1 bay leaf
- few strands of fresh thyme
- 1 cube of vegetable seasoning powder
- 2 tea spoon fresh cream
- 2 tea spoon butter
- 20 ml juice of fresh grapes(optional)
- 2 -3 table spoon grated Parmesan cheese
- 1/2 tea spoon freshly ground pepper
- olive oil
Heat a thick bottomed vessel.Add little olive oil in it and add chopped garlic and saute for 2 mins.Better if u use wooden spoon for it.Then add 1 bay leaf and few strands of fresh thyme and saute for few seconds.Now add the chopped onion and saute for few mins till its soft.
Meanwhile you can make the mushroom stalk.Mix the mushroom soup powder with 5 cups of water, stir it properly so that no lumps are formed.Heat this mixture for 4-5 mins till it gets mixed properly and thickens a bit.
Now when the onion is sauted well and is soft enough add the chopped mushrooms and saute them for few mins till they are done.Now add the grapes juice and cook till its fully absorbed by the mushrooms.Then add the rice and half amount of mushroom stalk which was prepared earlier.After few mins add the remaining mushroom stalk and vegetable seasoning powder and close and cook for 15-20 mins on low flame.
After 15-20 mins the rice need to be fully cooked and mushy.All the water need to be dried up.Then add little salt if required as seasoning powder,stalk and cheese already contains it.Add butter, fresh cream and grated parmesan cheese and mix it well.Cook for 1 min and add pepper powder and mix a bit and remove from flame.
Garnish with fresh parsley and serve it hot.
Preparation Time 30 mins
NOTE: Always use a thick bottomed vessel for it , or else the rice might get burned in the cooking process.
Use the ready-made available mushroom soup powder it gives a nice taste and flavour.
If you do not get fresh grapes juice, no problem you can follow the rest recipe or use white wine instead.Use of fresh grape juice gives a nice taste to mushrooms
For 1 cup of rice use of 5 cups of mushroom stalk is necessary.",en,web

"Editorial: The New Energy Star Homes Standards: A Rater's Perspective
Click here to read more articles about Archive
This article originally appeared in the May/June 2006
issue of Home Energy Magazine.
May 01, 2006
Every year on July 4, I’ve found myself listening to a reading of the Declaration of Independence on National Public Radio. Perhaps because I am advancing in age, the part about people being “disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable,” rather than change the things “to which they are accustomed” has taken on a deeper meaning for me. I am not fond of change. Nevertheless I have made the transition to the new guidelines for Energy Star-certified homes. This may seem a bit early, since homes enrolled in utility programs before December 31, 2005, and homes permitted before July 1, 2006, can receive the Energy Star Homes label under the old rules until the end of this year. But to maintain a consistent message to builders, I’ve chosen to break with the old regime already. One can see now that a change was inevitable. The old rating scores were based on reference homes meeting the 1993 Model Energy Code. Homes consuming equivalent amounts of space-heating,water-heating, and spacecooling energy (after adjusting for size, location, and heating fuel) scored an 80. In 1995, ...

"This week's Limited Time Magic experience is ""Long-Long Friends Week,"" with many rarely seen Disney characters showing up for meet-and-greets at the Magic Kingdom. The characters are available January 21–27, from 9 a.m. through 4 p.m., in the Town Square area, meeting for approximately 30 minutes every hour.
The characters are not actually signing autographs, probably because there was no time for them to practice to do the signatures consistently, so they are handing out pre-signed cards at each location. Here's a rundown of who's located where:
Uncle Scrooge and Professor von Drake are listed ""As Seen on Duck Tales,"" but von Drake only made an appearance in one episode of that show. Perhaps it was just the easiest way to relate the two characters.
Mary Poppins, Marie (from The Aristocats) and Pluto, who normally meet in Town Square, have been relocated for the week. Poppins is in Fantasyland, and Pluto and Marie are in Storybook Circus.
As always, you can find out the latest Limited Time Magic promotions on the Disney Parks Blog, at the Limited Time Magic website, via Twitter hashtag #LimitedTimeMagic, or here in the weekly Update.

Habit Heroes has reopened at Epcot's Innoventions. The exhibit, which opened and closed in a matter of weeks last February, has been completely reworked, as has the related website. Following the backlash that followed the controversial original, Walt Disney Imagineering and exhibit sponsor Florida Blue went back to the drawing board and have apparently found a way to promote healthy behavior without demonizing those who are not slender and fit.
Gone are the characters stereotyping overweight kids as evil, and heroes ""Callie Stenics"" and ""Will Power"" are nowhere to be seen. Instead, Director Jin leads a team of Agents Quench, Fuel, and Dynamo, whose specialties are hydration, nutrition, and activity, respectively. The villains are now Scorchers (which dehydrate you), Blocker Bots (that keep you from selecting healthier food choices), and Sappers (which weigh you down and sap your energy), matching the specialties of the three agents.
While I haven't seen all of the details of the new exhibit yet myself, early reports indicate that the new focus of the new Habit Heroes is positive for all, without browbeating any segments of the population. Overall, a good job in fixing something that had originally gone horribly wrong.

The ""Mickey Check"" announced last June, which first appeared at quick service locations and on some packaged Disney-branded retail snacks last November, has finally been rolled out to all table service locations as well. The logo marks choices on kids' menus that meet Disney's nutrition guidelines.
The logo makes it easier for kids and parents to tell at a glance which options are healthier. Parents can easily say ""you can choose whichever meal you like, as long as it has a Mickey Check."" Complete meals must be ordered without substitutions and include at least three of the following food groups: fruits and vegetables; whole grains; lean protein, beans, eggs, and nuts; or low-fat dairy. In addition, all limit saturated fat, sugar, sodium, and calories.
Unfortunately, though, the Mickey Check is not available on adult meals. It would be nice to have an easy way to check which meals are healthier without having to analyze each ingredient in the meal. Perhaps that's something that Disney can add in the near future. Please?

If you're looking for a novel way to enjoy the big game between the Baltimore Ravens and the San Francisco 49ers on February 3, Splitsville Lanes at Downtown Disney West Side is offering an interesting combination of Super Bowl party and fundraiser. For $75 per person, you'll get complimentary appetizers and buffet from 6–9 p.m., and an open bar (actually, all three bars will be open) for the same time period. (Note: You must be 21 or over with valid photo ID to enter the party.) The game will be showing on 40 flat-screen TVs throughout the facility. There will also be indoor and outdoor dining. Open bowling is also available for $20, subject to lane availability.
Part of the proceeds from the evening will benefit Clean the World, an Orlando-based non-profit organization that recycles hotel soap and cleaning products to redistribute to countries around the world to keep people worldwide from dying from diseases that can be prevented with proper handwashing.

The following is a listing of interesting items from paperwork filed with Orange County in the last week:
…Another in a series of periodic song choice updates has hit the American Idol Experience at Disney's Hollywood Studios. Many of the songs are based upon requests from those auditioning at the park, and is heavy on the country music. There are now 158 songs available for guests to audition with. Here's the list of new additions:
…Walt Disney World has finally officially confirmed the Wilderness Explorers interactive game at Disney's Animal Kingdom. Guests will soon be able to complete challenges and earn more than 30 badges while surveying the park using their field guides. It sounds kind of like MouseAdventure for the masses. It will be interesting to see how the game works and what guest reaction is.
…Another bit of variety in Walt Disney World menus has bitten the dust. Le Cellier in Epcot's Canada pavilion has dropped several menu items in the course of going to an all-day menu. So, for example, the lunchtime burgers will no longer be available, but you can now get the lobster mac and cheese at both lunch and dinner. Yes, the Cheddar Cheese Soup and filet mignon are still available. While it's uncertain whether this is the result of guests complaining that certain dishes were not available at certain meals or just cost reductions by not needing to purchase items to prepare as many different dishes, the change has taken place and the usually-booked-solid restaurant will likely continue to be a top draw year-round.
…This year's Epcot International Food & Wine Festival will take place from Friday, September 27 through Sunday, November 10.
…The crew of the Disney Dream rescued two stranded boaters last Wednesday. During the last day of the cruise, an announcement was made over the ship's intercom that the Dream was responding to a nearby distress signal. The ship sent out crew members in a lifeboat to rescue the duo, who were given food, water, and medical attention once aboard the Dream. They returned to Port Canaveral on Thursday aboard the ship. In a statement released by Disney Cruise Line, the company noted that ""We are proud of our Disney Dream crew members, who skillfully demonstrated their training and commitment to maritime protocols around saving lives at sea.""
…Registration for the featured events of the February 22–24, fifth annual Princess Half Marathon Weekend are full, including the individual and team Half Marathons, the Race Retreat, the Pasta in the Park Party and the ChEAR Squad Platinum Package.

Title: 3 Powerful Motivation Tips For Ripped Abs Word Count: 688 Summary: Make your new fitness habits much more productive with the best 3 motivational tips that will keep you going to the gym and dieting with a smile on your face every time. Keywords: ab workouts, fat loss, ripped abs, tight abs, washboard abs, ab exercises, training, exercising, free ab workouts, home workouts Article Body: Can you see your self walking down the street at your favorite location looking and feeling great. Or as you stroll down the beach and you notice people glance over there shoulders to admire your beautiful ripped abs that belong to you. Feeling so confident in your self that your vacation seems perfect like a dream. You pinch yourself and realize that you have arrived. Everyone in this green earth would love to have six pack abs and be fully healthy. Can everyone archive this goal? Yes. We people where created for excellence so yes, anything is possible. Although some may find it difficult to reach personal goals, anything is possible if you have an optimistic and positive outlook on life. ""Life is not fair"" We can begin our day very positive, but by the end of the day if you are not fully focused of your objective and constantly thinking of your aspirations you can be a victim of procrastination. We as humans tend to enjoy the path of least resistance. Justifying our excuses and having procrastinations of our objectives. Nobody said that being discipline was easy. As a matter of fact here are some examples of things we tell ourselves unconsciously that keeps us from hitting our goals: ""I would love to workout, but I don't want to be sore for tomorrow's barbeque."", ""I will have a free day this weekend therefore I will stuff my face with cookies and milk."", ""I love the gym, I just don't have time to go anymore."" The interesting thing is that we make ourselves believe such things. When in reality it is just bogus. The secret to success is not overworking but being in control of your thinking and outlooks in life. Whether you are looking to lose a few pounds or get in shape for bodybuilding competition, please under any circumstances don't let yourselves of any excuses. Here are some helpful mindsets that will help when you get back on track when you feel you are buying your excuses: One: Always tell your friends and family about your goals. Telling your acquaintances about your goals is great. Some will take you serious and some won't. But the reasoning behind this is that they can help you be on track. When you are genuine with people they respect that, and sometimes are willing to help you out. Two: Setting goals with a partner or friend. Often times having a workout partner or a dieting parter will make things better for everyone. Besides a little competition, a little encouragement from a workout buddy makes a huge difference. Pick someone that you enjoy being with and someone that you know will help you when you feel a bit down on your self. Friends are incredible at picking one up and making us feel great. Three: Writing down your aspirations and visions. Get a notepad right this moment, and jock down all of your goals and aspirations. On a piece of paper make a line down the middle. In one side have your ""goals"" and the other have ""aspirations"" example. Goal #1 Lose 10 pounds this month. Aspiration #1 Lose 10 pounds so I can buy a new pair of jeans, and so on. Make sure they are in detail and also try to make them very personable. Soon you wil develop these mental changes that will change your life forever subconsciously. Also Take note of the times you are at your lowest in energy and pull out your sheet and read those to you out loud. Might sound kind of weird but it works. Professional athletes do it everyday. Why not you? Getting in top shape is harder than it looks. It takes discipline and full commitment. Its rewards are priceless and the amount of confidence you get when you are watched or check out is amazing. Or even if you simply just want to live an incredible healthy lifestyle and carrying on that mindset to your family and kids, is absolutely worth it. Stay focused, stay in the fight and we will see you in the beaches of the world sporting your ripped abs.",en,web

"West Ham musings by Pete May, author of Hammers in the Heart, West Ham:Irons in the Soul and Flying So High:West Ham's Cup Finals.
Monday, May 28
Good to see Robert Green keep a clean sheet in the friendly against Norway (presumably John Carew now counts as Norwegian wood?). Apart from one dodgy moment when a corner hit the post, Greeno had a solid game and has finally played for England again and kept a clean sheet after his error against the USA. Capello treated him very unfairly at the time, ignoring the fine save he made later in the game to push the ball against the post. He could easily have played him against Algeria in the next game to boost his confidence, rather than publicly humiliate him. Good management by Roy Hodgson to ease Green back into the international set-up with a low-profile game.",en,web
"A Haughton man was arrested early Sunday morning for second offense driving while intoxicated and careless operation, according to Bossier Sheriff Larry Deen.
Joseph Robert Rosson, 55, of Peaceful Pines Drive, was taken into custody after a Bossier Sheriff’s deputy clocked the vehicle he was driving at 68 miles per hour in a 55-miles-per-hour zone. Another deputy then paced Rosson at 70 miles per hour in a 55-miles-per-hour zone.
Rosson performed poorly on the field sobriety tests, claiming he had back problems. He was taken into custody and transported to the Haughton Police Department for Intoxilyzer testing. Rosson refused to be tested and became very belligerent, screaming and cursing at the deputies. He said his lawyer had advised him to never submit to Intoxilyzer testing. He was arrested for D.W.I. in 1981, 1987 and 2006.
Rosson was transported to the Bossier Maximum Security Facility and booked. His bond was set at $2,200.",en,web

Talk About A Conflict Of Interest
The article said the Granholm Administration assumes it faces another $1 billion shortfall. It said the governor instructed staffers to make deeper budget cuts, but to keep their blades off K-12 and health care. Instead, she has indicated they instead ought to target universities and local governments.
We’re not impressed.
Lansing’s Medicaid reimbursements already have dropped into the realm of indecency, forcing hospitals to shift costs to the private sector. That, in turn, has inflated private sector health insurance premiums, causing the dilution or loss of many private sector workers’ health coverage.
Such tactics are behind-the-scenes tax increases, a hallowed Lansing tradition to which this administration seems likely to cling. A local CPA, Paul Hense, brought two such ploys to light last year. One, which legislators blocked, was the attempt to levy 50 percent penalties against small businesses that were late in filing state tax returns.
Later the Michigan treasury department in effect demanded that tax preparers file business returns electronically starting this spring. Otherwise, treasury warned, clients could face long, long and harassing delays in processing. Hense saw the move as treasury’s way of shucking administrative costs into the private sector.
What other “cuts” may come our way? Might the governor, for instance, persuade the legislature to delay the scheduled 2003 state income tax cut for yet another six months?
Well, as politicians say in election years and at budget time, tough times call for tough decisions. Well, here’s a real tough one we wish Lansing had the sand to make.
As recently revealed in these pages, Michigan government this year is paying 35 percent above its current payroll to finance its platinum-plated health care program for retirees. That huge surcharge on the state’s single biggest budget item — its payroll — has accelerated for five years.
It soon will accelerate beyond control if the governor and legislators don’t act. No, we don’t recommend that they terminate retiree benefits. No court would sustain such an act.
But they can modify current civil service health benefits, thus alleviating the cost of health insurance for the next retirees. Lansing should throw the meat on the table by opening negotiations with employee unions for higher deductibles, higher employee shares of premiums and modest reductions in benefits.
We don’t think it will happen, though — and not because it’s a Democrat vs. GOP thing.
It’s government vs. the people; civil service vs. John Q. Taxpayer
Lansing is populated by career politicians and bureaucrats convinced that the public owes them a comfortable living. We just can’t see legislators tackling this issue. They probably could handle the furor from employee unions. But our courageous, tough, cost-conscious guardians of the public tax dollars are about as likely to cut their own health care benefits as they are to vote against their own pay raises.
That’s why, when we mention this issue to area legislators, they get glassy-eyed, mumble that the issue hasn’t come up, and either change the subject or walk away.
Well, we’re bringing the issue up. If they don’t address it now, within a few years it will erode the fabric of the state.",en,web

Core courses reflect a constructivist framework, focusing on multilingual and multicultural methods, educational accountability, research-based best practices, leadership, and student-directed research in the art of teaching.
The MA in Curriculum and Instruction from Pacific Oaks College is one of only a handful of degree programs that prepare candidates for certification by the National Board for Professional Teaching (NBCT). Due to its novel approach that gives particular attention to sound alternative and progressive teaching methods, the program equips educators with new means to empower students by motivating them to direct their own learning, grow personally, and build upon their own experiences within the context of their unique cultural identities. Mirroring this, program candidates are immersed in a learning environment characterized by self-reflection, collaboration, development of respectful and reciprocal relationships, and problem-solving opportunities. At the core of the program is Pacific Oaks belief that every human being has innate value and infinite potential and graduates are prepared to help students discover their fundamental worth and strengths.

I think that is a stupid idea put an updating BIOS process using Windows application and was the first time that I use this ""System Update"" and for sure the last one!
Now, back to my problem... the notebook is out of guarantee, so I must find a solution to put the notebook working again.
My simple question is... what is the best way/solution? Can I reflash this BIOS again? How? Can I replace the BIOS physically? How?
In advance, thanks' for your help.
Solved! Go to Solution.

as far as i know, you have to either replace the bios chip or replace the motherboard. to reflash the bios you have to have a working bios, which you don't. and the bios chip is soldered on the board. i saw bios chips listed on ebay but none for an x60. i'll look around a bit to try to find one and maybe somebody will jump on here and come up with other ideas.

Thanks' for your reply topmahof.
Well, I have more ""working"" BIOS, because my company bought a pack of 10 notebook's of this model, so I have more 9 working :-).
For this one ""dead"", I think I have the backup of the ""old"" BIOS before start flashing, because I put the hard disk in a notebook of same model that is working and I can see all information.
If someone knows how to reflash again using ""software"", for sure I will try!

You will need a new motherboard, as the bios is physically soldered onto the motherboard.

nice tute... may come in handy for many people whom inadvertently bricked their laptop during a bios flashing session.
03-23-2010 11:18 AM
He doesn't need a new motehrboard, my X60 failed a bios update 3 weeks ago. I searched the web for a few days and found these guys: www.aqstech.com they did the repair of my BIOS for about $100 bucks. When I was checking around, a good supplier for this board was more than twice that price.

there were some threads in there about password cracking that i forgot about. that's why that link was removed.

Well, the problem is solved... I created an Frankenstein laptop
Accidentally, an user dropped a Thinkpad X61 laptop and broke the screen, so I take off the motherboard from this laptop and assemble in the chassis of the X60 with BIOS problem. The fingerprint don't work, but the laptop is functional.
I think Lenovo's equipments are good machines, must they must improve this point of flashing BIOS. It's ridiculous put a good laptop out of service, only due an bad updating without user's fault.
Thanks guys for your replies!

Lenovo has not replied to me regarding similar situation where they said i should restore my pc to an earlier date, which in turn had my old system update install the BIOS update through Windows7this bricked my working W520 what a shame... It wastes my time for this sort of negligence that makes me have ""such inconvenience"" and makes them look as they produce goods of bad quality. ignoring users who had your updates ""fixing"" your laptops willnot give you a good name.

"The height of fear is often when markets put in their bottoms, and fear is not in short supply today. While there are many macro-economic items to mull over-- such as the Grecian haircut on debt repayment and the possibility of another recession – it is difficult know when to buy, sell, or hold when talking about these complex issues with vague trading signals.
Is there reason to believe that markets are firming? What are a couple of techniques to look at?
The FED Model
I have never favored valuation techniques when considering market timing. The valuation concept is to compare share price to some fundamental ratio to determine good value or not. While this has its place, all too often the fundamental value dumps instead of prices going up. Investors who know the high stakes are simply pricing in a large amount of risk into these troubled markets. What are the valuation figures?
The earnings yield (using current year estimates) sits at 7.89%, which is a far cry above the 2.2% yield ten- year Treasury note for a 5.7% gap. According to the FED model, the S&P 500 is a good buy and has been for some time.
The massive drawback that I can see is that the model is rooted in the forecasting power of (forward) price-to-earnings ratios. The earnings yield is an inverse P/E ratio. In a static market, a forward earnings yield of 10 would mean 10% profit. An earnings yield of 20 (or a forward P/E of 5) would equal 20% profit. But the market is dynamic and always changing, making price-to-earnings or earnings yield a crude way to value the market. In addition to problems with moving share prices, you also have to accept that the forward earnings yield is simply an estimate that may or may not happen. I am not a big proponent of the ‘buy low P/E stocks because they are dirt cheap’ mentality.
Trending Earnings Forecast
Another way to time the market is to use earnings momentum. You take the current year’s earnings forecast on the S&P 500 (SPY) and watch for trends. You can further improve upon this by adding moving averages to smooth out little spikes up and down. The current year’s earnings forecast since March 2011(daily revisions) is below compliments of Portfolio123.
Click to enlarge
As you can see, despite a sharp earnings upgrade last week, the overall trend is still down. With the aid of moving averages to create a timing trigger (I use 3 and 15 weeks), the market could enter early bull territory as early as next week. As we near the end of the current year, however, the forecasting ability lessens and I find myself drawn to using next year’s earnings forecast – which is still in a tail slide.

You can read a little more about this market timing forecast here.
Long-Term Moving Averages
Instead of focusing on short-term or other interpretive signals, I will refer to the paper, Technical Analysis with a Long Term Perspective: Trading Strategies and Market Timing Ability. The researchers in this paper used a variety of techniques for market timing that utilized very long-term moving averages that spanned for years. Between 1994 and 2009 they were able to generate 572% returns as opposed to the 90% benchmark returns of the S&P 500. You will need to read the paper to learn the exact technique, but the one method with high economic significance used the 'best-fit long-term moving average' over the trailing 4 years to make a trading rule for the forward 4 years.
What do very long-term averages tell us about the current market based on the past 4 years of data? Since our markets have whipped up and down with high volatility, the less responsive long-term moving averages have not been able to keep up during the past 48 months. Below are two medium / long range moving averages which we are quickly nearing, but still underneath.
- The 200 day is at 1275
- The 300 day is at 1241
I also find it useful to use a shorter-term moving average, such as the 100 day, when confirming market trends using the analyst earnings forecast. We just popped above the 100 day on Friday and are touching the underside of the 300 day as we speak.
What This All Means
What does this mean for me? Well, I think that the recent rally is making a valiant attempt at something far grander. Has it hit the target to buy? Not for me. It could happen as soon as this week, but I have my doubts. As I look to next year’s earnings forecast trend, it would take a few strong weeks of upward revisions to have me believing that it is the right time to buy. While the market is making some alluring technical moves, I try to use these only as a backup signal.
Some like to buy in all conditions – which is a smart move if you don’t intend to sell with market timing signals. Buying in bull markets and holding in bear markets (without adding to your position) does not make sense, as you buy during high valuations only. Peter Lynch suggests buying regularly in all markets, and if you are not going to use market timing it is a good alternative.
While I see lists of cheap stocks being advertised including companies such as Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Ford Motor Company (F), Intel Corp (INTC), and Microsoft (MSFT), I am going to wait a little longer yet for the market to prove to me that it deserves my money.

"Getting your assets in gear
The network is taking a wait-and-see approach to asset management
By Peter J. Brown -- Broadcasting & Cable, 11/5/2000 7:00:00 PM
Shelve data broadcasting. Forget HDTV. The hottest ticket for broadcast suppliers is asset management. In addition to software companies that are asset-management specialists, storage, server and automation vendors are lining up to offer customers new ways to store, access, repurpose and distribute their content.
The emphasis here is on ""managing"" and not merely assembling software and hardware tools. It is far more than just the transition from analog to digital media. Work-flow analysis, the identification of embedded ""cultural"" traits within the organization, and process re-engineering are all key components in the asset-management strategy.
Asset management is already a big business. Charles Caldwell, vice president at Rye, N.H.-based GISTICS, projects sales for next year for the total media-asset-management market will rise to $3.2 billion from $507 million in 1997. The hardware side will account for $1.7 billion-up from $175 million in 1995-while software sales will total $1.29 billion-with services reaching $242 million.
""Asset management provides two different value propositions,"" says Jeremy Schwartz, senior analyst at Forrester Research in Boston. ""For anyone who has digital assets, it offers a cost-saving effect in the form of streamlined production processes. It also allows shared access, both internally and externally, via an extranet with outside partners on a project-by-project basis, for such things as more efficient version control as well as low-resolution previewing. Metadata is the key that underlies, and enables, all of this.""
Asset management is not a new phenomenon in the television industry. Most broadcasters and large cable programmers practice some level of asset management.
""The questions posed to us are now based on some degree of experience. Media companies are not trying this for the first time. Rather, many have text-archive management systems of one kind or another, and these are often linked to digital-tape libraries,"" says Philip Page, executive director of the media and Web-publishing group at Oakland, Calif.-based Informix/Media360, an asset-management software powerhouse.
Page identified three major asset-management-related objectives that permeate discussions both in North America and Europe. Having access to variable metadata is the top priority. Another goal is achieving what Page describes as ""super-connectivity"": the establishment of a direct link between digital archives, newsrooms, NLE (nonlinear editing) suites and Web sites. Specifying the entire chain of events in the realm of rights management, asset security and revenues-the triggering of a stream of verifiable transactions either on a nonroyalty basis or resulting in fixed royalties with or without embedded licenses-is the third priority.
""This is one of the most confusing subjects. It is closely tied to a broader discussion of metadata, due to the ability of content producers to embed their rights and royalties information within the digital-content package itself,"" says Page.
""The focus on providing good asset-management systems should take into consideration the requirements of the broadcaster, not what some IT specialist thinks is important,"" said Andrew Ioannou, president of UK-based Omnibus Systems' U.S. subsidiary in Nevada City, Calif. ""People are the most important asset to any broadcaster, because they are the ultimate creators of the product. The solutions we provide should give people the tools they want and not what we think they want.""
Asset management is vast in scope, ranging from compressed digital (MPEG/DVB) transport and multichannel broadcasting with enhanced and interactive components to unicast and multicast Web content streaming over broadband networks. Each application represents something entirely different at the point of origin as the digital content shifts from sector to sector, encompassing a vast terrain of broadcasters, satellite and cable operators, and content-production powerhouses like Hollywood studios.
""Customers want out-of-the-box functionality, natural-language search, annotation and collaboration capabilities along with the ability to manage multiple media types in their native form,"" says Cynthia Francis, vice president of marketing and business development at Vienna, Va.-based eMotion Inc.
The company's MediaPartner 4.0 software represents a full end-to-end solution, putting eMotion in direct competition with Bulldog and Maryland-based Artesia Technologies. Partnering with EMC Corp. and Sun Microsystems while embracing Avid Technologies Inc.'s Open Media Management (OMM) platform is one way to add to eMotion's momentum, says Francis.
""Will there be a product offering with a work-flow component baked into it? That leads back to my point about out-of-the-box functionality, which is something we emphasize,"" Francis says.
Managing across all media
According to David Vap, Artesia's director of product marketing, asset management is not just about managing Web content. Nor is it limited to video logging, which entails breaking up the video content into key frames and extracting out the metadata.
""Artesia's TEAMS 4.0 software, which has already been embraced by customers ranging from giant General Motors to start-up FeedRoom.com, is not a parking lot where digital assets go to die,"" says Vap. ""It is an enterprise-wide solution, which can be adapted to any size installation, with instant fulfillment as one objective. We can handle asset types from text to MPEG-2, and distribute those assets to every conceivable client and delivery channel.""
TEAMS 4.0 supports Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language (SMIL), which introduces the concept of the Play Decision List (PDL) to contribute to a more efficient and streamlined production process.
""Enabling users to edit over the Web on low-resolution proxies is taken to the next level with the SMIL-based PDL, because you can create totally new assets, while aligning low-resolution and high-resolution versions,"" says Vap. ""This is based on recognizing and overlaying the same time codes.""
Media capture and indexing is the specialty of Vienna, Va.-based Excalibur Technologies, which will soon unite with Intel's Interactive Media Services group to form a new company known as Convera. Excalibur is already pushing the asset-management envelope with its Screening Room 2.2 digital-archiving engine priced in the $75,000 to $80,000 range. ABC O & O's KABC-TV Los Angeles and KGO-TV San Francisco are both Screening Room customers.
Excalibur is also introducing a new XML-based video logger known as Screening Room Capture, which will simultaneously perform platform encoding for both Windows Media and Real Networks players.
""The ability to publish metadata as HTML and XML is seen by us as a significant leap forward,"" said Dan Agan, Excalibur's vice president of marketing. ""Simultaneous read/write is allowing content editors and creators to write directly to the database in real time as well. Discovery, for example, wanted that type of access as material was backhauled, via satellite, both during their recent ECO Challenge and for their upcoming special coverage of the manned mission on the International Space Station.""
Excalibur's RetrievalWare, a text-driven search engine, is another core offering.
""Our goal is to ensure that any metadata present can be extracted, and that the asset is searchable and leverageable,"" says Agan. ""The publishing side is where a lot of energy needs to be focused. Creating demand for the consumption of video in the lean-forward environment means solving the bandwidth issue. The quality is there for certain applications, but not others.
""And codecs [encoder/decoders] are not the culprits here on the ingest side. Now that we have seen demonstrations of video direct to IP, we are quite confident that codecs will surface that will handle any bandwidth flow.""
Of course, before someone leaps into Web-based syndication, there is the more fundamental issue of figuring out who holds valid asset-management credentials.
""At the major trade shows like NAB and IBC this year, you encountered some form of asset management in every stall. But only a fraction of the companies trying to promote these so-called asset-management solutions really understand what asset management is all about. And fewer still appear to be seeking integrated partnerships,"" says Mark Jones, director of the Jupiter Project at BBC News in London.
Content without boundaries
Formidable asset-management players with very deep pockets abound. The list includes IBM, Sony and Hopkinton, Mass.-based EMC Corp., which acquired Denver-based Avalon this summer.
""We are offering a comprehensive infrastructure, where we facilitate the high-end storage, management and delivery of rich media for our customers,"" said Doron Kempel, general manager of EMC's media solutions group. ""With Avalon, we allow for flexible policies concerning the movement of content across platforms. Rich media requires intelligent content-propagation technology. We are leveraging Avalon, taking their technology to completely different applications and feature sets, from the LAN to the WAN."" EMC is taking what Kempel describes as a ""holistic"" approach.
""Media streaming is removing the license and country boundaries, and puts an emphasis on really knowing your content,"" Kempel says. ""There is no opportunity here for some sort of point-in-time snapshot. All the core components are going to grow, so the key is to provide a supporting infrastructure, which grows and scales accordingly. Being culturally sympathetic as you set out to liberate operations in this regard is important, too.""
This year, EMC joined with Cisco Systems, Sun Microsystems, Oracle, Digital Island and iXL to launch the ""Create Once, Publish Everywhere,"" or COPE, intitiative. The aim is to establish an integration model, not just for asset management but for dynamic media creation, publishing, distribution and presentation.
IBM's expertise in digital-library creation and hierarchical-storage management is added to Sony's PetaSite robotic data-tape solution at CNN, for example, where a $20 million digital-archive system is taking shape. Virage is also part of CNN's system.
IBM's Content Manager, a rich-media database that is a much enhanced follow-up to IBM's earlier DB2 Digital Library platform, is one example of the company's vast array of software-driven content-management and content-distribution solutions for broadcasters, says Dave Trumbo, solutions manager for content management at IBM's Global Media & Entertainment Industry group in Santa Monica, Calif.
IBM's hardware solutions for asset management include IntelliStations-high-performance NT workstations for video editing and digital creation tools; highly reliable UNIX servers; and a full spectrum of data-storage products for storage area networks (SANs), online disk storage and near-line automated tape libraries. IBM Linear Tape-Open (LTO) products include automated tape libraries that handle up to 200 GB of compressed data per cartridge at data-transfer rates of up to 30 MB/s.
""The LTO technology is an open industry standard with multiple vendors supporting the technology, [thus] offering protection for broadcasters' investments,"" says Trumbo. ""There is also a clearly defined growth roadmap for the technology, increasing tape capacity by eight times over the next four years.""
Roadmap for digital
The IBM Content Manager-based video-asset-management system integrates with partners AdWare, Avid, Grass Valley Group, MediaSite, Sony and Virage. Significant enhancements targeted for broadcasters are currently under development, according to Trumbo, who adds that IBM is positioned to offer specific implementation support and to assist in the development of a roadmap for a customer's digital transformation.
Conrad Coffield, vice president of sales at Sony Electronics Broadcast and Professional Co., says that, when it comes to selling an asset-management system, to coin a phrase, ""it takes a village."" And it all starts with a consulting engagement. Sony employs what Coffield calls a ""use case"" methodology.
""You have to identify how work flow will be affected by the asset-management implementation. That will drive which software applications and hardware configurations will be used. You do not simply put metadata in,"" Coffield says. ""All the processes involved should be systematically analyzed and planned. It took six months alone just to identify the 300 to 400 use cases at CNN, which in turn generated over 2,500 specific requirements translated back to individual pieces of software and hardware.""
Sony's GY-8240 DTF-2 tape drive represents the next generation of high-speed, large-capacity drives with 200 GB of storage per cassette and sustained-transfer rates of 24 MB/s.
""DTF has a forward-migration plan that takes it up to 800 GB per cassette and a sustained transfer rate of 96 GB/s with backward compatibility to DTF-1,"" Coffield says. In the realm of film-to-data capture and compositing, Sony has partnered with Discreet by allowing 4:4:4 real-time capture and transfer on its VIALTA telecine system using Discreet's Backdraft solution to manage and track film transfer in the background. Outputting on a one-film-pass basis from the VIALTA to RGB data, HDTV and SDTV is now possible.
Finished material can be recorded on a Sony DTF-1 or DTF-2 data recorder. And automated EDL capture and assembly via Backdraft allows operators of Discreet Inferno, Flame, Flint, Fire and Smoke to avoid the cross-platform interchange-related time delays.
Nevada City, Calif.-based GVG is attacking asset management from several directions. Its innovative XML-based ContentShare software, for example, is an attempt to address what GVG sees as a huge gap: the lack of standardized data-exchange interfaces. ContentShare is not only resident in GVG's new line of Profile XP media platforms but has also been adopted by more than a dozen other companies.
""What we are telling the application developers is that we have now made software available that lets the tools work together and eliminates the need for customized software,"" says Steven Bilow, GVG's product marketing manager for media-software products. ""End users can now choose whatever tools they want. This allows for asset management across different devices. At the same time, it addresses the issue of legacy applications by giving developers the option of writing a small piece of software in the form of a broker, rather than creating a whole new driver or scrapping the device in question, which is a costly and avoidable option.""
GVG is also facilitating Webcasting and Web-distribution activities with its drag-and-drop-driven WebAble product, another ContentShare-based application. WebAble comprises software modules that enable users to browse MPEG-1 versions of Profile Media, and then send them out over the Internet in the Windows Media or Real Video formats. A future QuickTime version is planned as well.
SGI is focused on convergence via its ""Media Commerce"" solutions, including a 64-bit MIPS mid-range video server. The SGI Media Server for production and broadcast is priced from $100,000 to $150,000 and can store up to 176 hours of DVCPRO-25. A more scaled-back version starts at $60,000.
The SGI Media Server for production is an out-of-the-box solution with a real-time FTP file system for inter-facility as well as intra-facility file transfers via SMPTE 305M SDTI for 4X RT transfer. The SGI Media Server for broadband with Kasenna MediaBase software is a multiple-bit-rate streaming-media platform.
""Two years ago, the theme was all about keeping everything behind the firewall on the intranet,"" says Greg Estes, vice president and general manager of SGI's telecommunications and media group. ""Now, the doors have opened and customers are looking for the easiest way to take content and manage it and repurpose it inside and outside their facilities.""
Montreal-based Keops Broadcast's MediaWorks application is built on SGI's StudioCentral Library and brings frame-accurate video browsing with an added emphasis on single-version video-clip management. It runs on SGI's MediaServer as well as GVG's Profile. MediaWorks supports GIF, JPEG, MPEG and QuickTime formats, allowing users to immediately store, find, share and play digital assets.
Dominique Ste-Marie, president and CEO of Keops Broadcast, believes that control of both high-resolution and low-resolution copies in a synchronous stream offers more than merely a time-saving advantage in the larger sphere of asset management.
""It reduces the bandwidth and storage requirement substantially,"" Ste-Marie says. ""Controlling the high-resolution world at the point of ingestion is what I consider to be our key differentiation.""
Keops Broadcast is supporting multiple NLE formats with MediaWorks as well as EDL support for Avid/ALE, CMX 3600 and Discreet's Backdraft extensions.
Integrators get involved
System integrators have watched the growing influence of asset management with great interest, knowing from the outset that the challenges posed would be substantial.
""There is a recognition that no one single, monolithic, overall, asset-management infrastructure exists, but rather a number of disparate media-management elements, each of which performs an important but particular function and does it very well,"" says David George, a director and senior consultant with New Jersey-based AZCAR Technologies (IMMAD ECVS). ""Bringing these together under some common technology umbrella presents both new problems and new opportunities for the system integrators.""
This involves much more than the traditional organization of a number of hardware elements into a working whole, according to George. Critical new skill sets are required to address new problems such as file manipulation and control, data storage and retrieval, video/data compression and processing, and metadata strategies and application.
""The need to develop new and innovative software solutions from scratch in particular is not an arena in which traditional system integrators have been strong,"" says George. ""The introduction of this additional data-intensive dimension into the overall facility design accelerates the transition that all integrators must make from a video to a data world in which IT skills and resources become as valuable as television experience once was.""
Automation vendors such as Colorado-based ENCODA Systems Inc., Omnibus Systems and FloriCal are looking to capitalize on the intrinsic ties between asset-management solutions or platforms and incumbent automation systems.
""We are looking at a business model in Europe where the mechanics of playout are now being successfully subcontracted out, including ingest and transmission,"" says Barry Goldsmith, CEO of ENCODA. For example, Encoda operates a broadcast facility in London for Scandinavian DTH satellite operator Viasat.
""You have more multichannel operators in play in Europe, too, so the whole model is different, including the emphasis on centralized playout,"" says Goldsmith. ""For example, the film library at BSkyB in the UK is linked via ATM to the uplink site, which is 30 to 40 miles away. There, 70 to 80 movie channels are transmitted using GVG servers on a Fibre Channel infrastructure.""
According to Jim Moneyhun, president of Florida-based FloriCal Systems Inc., automation vendors are responsive to customers searching for asset-management solutions, because the trend toward shared resources in multichannel environments is a natural extension of automation.
Moneyhun cites examples such as wwor-tv in New York and wutb(tv) in Baltimore, two stations operated from a single site in New Jersey, along with wfla-tv in Tampa, a new facility where newspaper and television news departments share space. At wfla-tv, four video servers and a StorageTek digital robot hold the station's assets, managed by FloriCal's acquisition, storage-management and on-air presentation solutions.
""With TV networks like Groupe TVA Montreal, for example, we are handling multiple-network programming from one central EMC Celerra server out to affiliates and to five regional server-equipped stations all across Canada,"" Moneyhun says. ""In Australia, Europe and Canada, we routinely encounter a degree of regionalization and centralization that you do not see here in the U.S. yet.""

"Scientific American has an excellent article debunking seven of the main climate change denial talking points promoted by people like James Inhofe: Seven Answers to Climate Contrarian Nonsense.
The introduction to the article draws the distinction between honest skeptics and deniers, a topic that’s frequently raised in our threads about climate change:
On November 18, with the United Nations Global Warming Conference in Copenhagen fast approaching, U.S. Sen. James R. Inhofe (R–Okla.) took the floor of the Senate and proclaimed 2009 to be “The Year of the Skeptic.” Had the senator’s speech marked a new commitment to dispassionate, rational inquiry, a respect for scientific thought and a well-grounded doubt in ghosts, astrology, creationism and homeopathy, it might have been cause for cheer. But Inhofe had a more narrow definition of skeptic in mind: he meant “standing up and exposing the science, the costs and the hysteria behind global warming alarmism.”
Within the community of scientists and others concerned about anthropogenic climate change, those whom Inhofe calls skeptics are more commonly termed contrarians, naysayers and denialists. Not everyone who questions climate change science fits that description, of course—some people are genuinely unaware of the facts or honestly disagree about their interpretation. What distinguishes the true naysayers is an unwavering dedication to denying the need for action on the problem, often with weak and long-disproved arguments about supposed weaknesses in the science behind global warming.
What follows is only a partial list of the contrarians’ bad arguments and some brief rebuttals of them.
Read the whole thing. There’s a lot of good information about the role of CO2 as a greenhouse gas, the “hockey stick” graph, the influence of the sun on global warming, and the false claim that global warming “stopped a decade ago.”
(The comments for the article are overflowing with deniers and contrarians, spouting the very talking points the article debunks, of course.)",en,web
"LENINGRAD — Imagine George Washington as hateful.
Imagine a campaign to rename Washington, D.C., as the most cherished political hope of residents in the nation`s capital.
Imagine the Founding Fathers discredited and in disgrace, blamed rather than praised for the American Revolution, while the new president and his Congress scurry to rewrite the Constitution and the history books to keep the country from disintegrating into 50 independent states. Imagine National Guard tanks already on patrol in several state capitals to keep the peace.
Then imagine trying to grow up in this atmosphere of shattered ideology and faith, and you might just be able to understand why I see a crisis in Soviet youth.
It is a quiet crisis, because its manifestation is apathy and studied indifference toward everything but the most personal concerns.
Living in Leningrad for the past half-year, I have spent a great deal of time with teenagers and young adults, going to school with them, hanging out after school with them, and talking, talking, talking with them.
They are the Soviet ``Lost Generation.``
At a Leningrad high school, I was talking about belief with a 16-year-old who immediately responded that her age group ``could best be described as nihilists.``
Her parents` generation grew up with a comforting belief that dictator Joseph Stalin saved the nation from the Nazis and rebuilt its economy. But youth raised during glasnost know the truth about his labor camps, show trials and mass executions.
``For us, there was no way we could believe in Stalin, since I, for instance, began hearing the truth about Stalin when I was 7-my father told me,`` she said.
Indifference is the primary characteristic of contemporary teenagers, as one parent related to me. This indifference is selective, protective, directed at Soviet society, politics and economics, which have never evinced any interest in improving young people`s lives, but only in complicating them.
Thus, young Leningraders` indifference toward their own society is paired with a thirst not only for information about the West but also for the life there. Nearly without exception, Soviets aged 16 to 26 hate politics and only want a better life.
One variation of this attitude manifests itself in a desire to emigrate, mostly seen in those over 18 and out of school. They distrust their political system and its politicians, and thus have no desire to participate. Recent bloodshed in the Baltics and the insulting monetary reform, in which people`s life`s savings were wiped out overnight, only reinforced this distrust.
Those who do participate in political life are a small minority. They join such fringe groups as the Monarchists-who call for the return of the czarist autocracy-or Anarchists-who believe that having no system is better than having one.
There are several preservationist movements, with more wholesome platforms, in which young people participate, one dedicated to the
architectural renaissance of Leningrad and another whose politics parallel the West European Greens Party.
The Komsomol, or Young Communist League, like an ideological Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts, has a dwindling cadre. Participation once was a prerequisite for future professional standing, but today its members remain more from inertia than interest.
A 16-year-old told me she is still a komsomolka, but only because she retains a membership card. There are rarely meetings these days, and she never attends.
Steps toward a market economy and private property also brought changes in Soviet youth. Some young Leningraders doubt the value of finishing their higher education at technical or professional institutes, or of ever working officially at all if they have obtained their decrees.
Thanks to the current inflation, they have seen their parents` salaries becoming laughably insufficient, and realize they would be better off at semi- legal biznes-or even plying the illegal black market-than trusting the system that betrayed their parents.
Young speculators who bribe their way into possession of scarce consumer goods at government prices resell them at a price 10 times higher, netting in one day more than an honest worker makes in a month. One 25-year-old told me he dropped out of an engineering institute because he can earn more as a private car mechanic in the shadow economy. And black marketeers, who often earn their profits in Western currencies, live the most golden life of all, even if it is totally illegal.
These are the new hero-workers of Soviet society.
The cultural effects on Soviet teenagers of the current social transformations tend to be more subtle. For ethnic Russians, their identity is reinforced by joining the recently unfettered Orthodox Church; last January, the Russian Orthodox Christmas was officially celebrated for the first time in 74 years. One teen told me she even was christened last fall-at her own intitiative.",en,books
"|MadSci Network: Evolution|
When people ask about eukaryotic organisms that lack mitochondria, the obvious candidate is Giardia intestinalis, a single celled intestinal parasite. For a long time, Giardia was thought to be a basal eukaryote, representing a survivor from the days before mitochondrial endosymbosis had occured.
However, as discussed by Mike Klymkowsky in this answer (1069520850.Cb), even Giardia contain remnants of mitochondria.
Eukaryotes that do not have obvious mitochondria are known as amitochondrial organisms. This group includes Giardia and other parasites such as Trachipleistophora hominis and Entamoeba histolytica. However, all of these appear to have remnants of mitochondria in their cytoplasms (as well as mitochondrial genes in their nuclear genomes), and in most cases these remants seem to retain some sort of function.
Take a look at the following papers for more information about the cytoplasmic and genomic mitochondrial remnants in these organisms.
Chan KW, Slotboom DJ, Cox S, Embley TM, Fabre O, van der Giezen M, Harding M, Horner DS, Kunji ER, Leon-Avila G, Tovar J. (2005) A novel ADP/ATP transporter in the mitosome of the microaerophilic human parasite Entamoeba histolytica. Curr Biol. 15(8):737-42.
Regoes A, Zourmpanou D, Leon-Avila G, van der Giezen M, Tovar J, Hehl AB. (2005) Protein import, replication, and inheritance of a vestigial mitochondrion. J Biol Chem. 280 (34):30557-63.
Williams BA, Hirt RP, Lucocq JM, Embley TM. (2002) A mitochondrial remnant in the microsporidian Trachipleistophora hominis. Nature. 418 (6900):865-9.
I thought that this quote from the end of the abstract in the Williams paper was particularly interesting, ""The finding of relictual mitochondria in [amitochondrial organisms] provides further evidence of the reluctance of eukaryotes to lose the mitochondrial organelle, even when its canonical function of aerobic respiration has been apparently lost.""
So, all eukaryotes appear to have mitochondria (or to be descended from an organism that had a functional mitochondrion). As Michael Onken points out in this answer (887302952.Ge), all mitochondria seem to be descended from the same ancestral endosymbiont. It seems likely that the first eukaryotes to incorporate endosymbiont organisms were wildy successful, and out-competed any nucleated non-endosymbiont organisms. With smaller, less complicated genomes and fewer internal structures to maintain, bacteria and archaea have been able to compete successfully against eukaryotes, where nucleated non-endosymbionts failed.
You can find much more information about research into amitochondrial organisms by searching for the word 'amitochondrial' on PubMed.

"An open letter to the president of the United States of America from the International Alliance of Grandmas for Progress:
Dear Mr. President,
Obamamamas around the globe are alarmed today that your historic, transformative, catharctic rule may come to a premature end and that all the mesmerizing promises of revolutionary change will not come to pass. We propose a three-step plan to close the trust gap and give you a mandate to achieve your progressive dreams of a new America and a better world:
- People are rightfully disgusted with your healthcare reform---both its content and the way it was passed does nothing to strengthen democracy or address the needs of patients. There is a simple solution for the fears of all the uninsured. While you still hold the majority, Congress must nationalize hospitals and mandate doctors to provide treatment to all who need it. Their costs will be covered and they will all receive a living wage from communal health accounts financed by excise taxes on yachts and private jets as well as import tariffs on caviar and champagne.
- The way things are going with the economy, you will soon have to deal with an opposition takeover of Congress. It is naïve to keep throwing good money down that bottomless capitalist drain expecting economic recovery and job growth in the private sector in time for this year's election, but we can do something to save the White House for you in 2012. Expropriating all the idle capital and spreading it among the idle workers will add nothing to the deficit and will have an immediate economic effect. The empowered proletarians will form cooperatives, producing Monday through Thursday and serving as managers on Fridays. GDP goes through the roof; unemployment becomes a thing of the past.
- What started the whole mess that propelled you to power in 2008 was a housing bubble. Capitalism is predestined to booms and busts. The electorate has anointed you to end this cannibalistic system of production for profits. The first step is to let the homeless move into the empty houses. Then a National Bureau of Production for the People will gather statistical data and determine what to produce and how to distribute it in the most equitable and fair way---and we shall let the workers' cooperatives determine in a democratic and decentralized manner how to reach their quotas.
Your fans forever,

The end of World War Two saw the perfect storm in corporate America. An economy swollen with profits from the war, executives and middle management used to moving swiftly from plant to plant, division to division across the country and lots of returning pilots, many anxious to continue flying - for a living, this time. There lacked but one thing, the fast passenger aircraft to act as corporate transports. The demobilised C-47 (see blog entry) was too slow, the C-46 (see blog entry) was too large and not many were available. Companies turned to the ranks of the now redundant twin-engined medium bomber and attack aircraft.
There were problems with many of these ‘warbirds’. As well as being hung around with such excressences as gun turrets and bomb aimer’s positions, their fuselages all had one characteristic that there was no getting around. They were of comparatively small cross-sectional area – to reduce drag and keep the speed as high as possible. Consequently, although the A-20 Havoc (see blog) was converted in small numbers as a company transport, and the B-25 Mitchell (see blog) performed the same function as a VIP transport for the fledgling USAF and some civilian owners, even when all the operational equipment was removed, there still was not enough room. The solution lay with the Lockheed Ventura/Harpoon series of patrol bombers, which had capacious fuselages due to their ancestor, the Lockheed Model 18 civil transport.
Several conversions of these Lockheed twins were made post-war including the Oakland Centaurus and the Spartan Ventura, but the best-known exponent of Ventura conversions was Howard Aero Inc. of San Antonio, Texas. Durrell Unger ‘Dee’ Howard, along with the well-known aircraft designer Ed Swearingen, made a series of modifications (mainly surrounding increased tankage, luxury interiors and heavy-duty undercarriage from PV-1 aircraft); from 1955 onwards, these included the Super Ventura, Super Harpoon, Howard 350 and Howard 400. However, it wasn’t until Howard bought the fuselage and wing jigs from Lockheed, that a definative airframe emerged. The Howard 500 was a new-built aircraft, with an all new, pressurized fuselage (+6.75lb/sq in, giving sea-level pressure at 16,000 ft), executive interior for between 10 and 14 passengers, non-stop Transcontinental range, and a cruising speed of 350 mph. Twenty two Howard 500s were built, plus eight converted from PV-2 Harpoons to almost the same standard as the Howard 500. Modifications included Pratt & Whitney R-2800 Double Wasp engines, similar to those on the Douglas DC-6, propeller hubs from the Chance-Vought F4U Corsair, propellers and spinners from a Douglas DC-7, outer wing panels from a Venture, and a new, ‘wet’, inner wing.
N500LN, seen here at ‘Airbase’ Coventry, is one of only two Howard 500s left in the world, the other, N500HP being based in Minnesota. It was converted from a Ventura GR.V which saw service with the RAF (FP579) and SAAF (6417) after being handed over by the USN, for whom it had been built as a PV-1. Formerly owned by Duncan Baker of Baker Petroleum Ltd., and based at Exeter International Airport (IATA - EXT; ICAO – EGTE), it rarely flew until delivered to Coventry on May 18, 2010. It has now been completely overhauled for its new U.S. owner, TP Universal Exports International LLC of Eagan, Minnesota. It is waiting for its Transatlantic ferry flight.
Sadly, the Howard 500 emerged at about the same time as the first generation turboprop executive aircraft, the Grumman Gulfstream 1, and despite attempts to refine it further – a single Howard Eldorado 700 was built – it was based on ‘old technology’, and never made a sales breakthrough.",en,reference
"- Cuisines: American
NileGuide Expert tip:
Sit inside if you want to avoid being hassled by the sadly prevalent street hawkers around here.
- The Pham Ngu Lao backpacker district may be heaven for thrifty westerners seeking familiar fare for pennies, but much of the food peddled down here can be filed under 'forgettable'.
There are, however, a good few notable exceptions and this long-standing favorite is one. The friendly, smiling waitresses set a nice vibe from the off and the presence of several vintage Vespas outside provide a dash of louche style to proceedings. Reasonably priced drinks are the main stock in trade, but the food is far from being mere ballast for another heavy night on the tiles. Paninis, sandwiches and salads are professionally presented and imaginatively composed, but the real stars here are the burgers. Toppings such as gorgonzola and emmental and bacon are suitably decadent while a price tag of around $4 a pop will ensure that any cravings for packaged patties from McDonalds or Burger King – both absent in Vietnam – will be well and truly assuaged.

"In honor of International Coaching Week, February 6 through 12, I am posting a series of short articles about coaching.
My path to becoming a coach was rather roundabout. I have an established career as a professional book copy editor, and for a while I had my own direct sales business as well. After a particularly grueling quarter with some difficult projects and a lot of extra work, I was exhausted and extremely frustrated. I felt like I was doing the same old thing over and over! I started thinking about what I really wanted, and I began to realize that I wanted my work to make a difference in the world and have an impact in people’s lives. I was getting tempting little tastes of it here and there, and I decided to ramp that up! The only problem was, I wasn’t sure what path would allow me to do that. Should I find a job somewhere? Go back to school? Try something entirely different? At that point “keep doing what I’m doing” was not an attractive option!
In what turned out to be a life-changing meeting, I attended the national conference for my sales company and met a wonderful trainer. I was struck by her enthusiasm and creative ideas, so I made a point of going up to her and asking point-blank if there was any way I could work for her! She said, “I need coaches with your sales experience” (to coach other direct sellers). Ding ding ding! The more I thought over this option, the more appealing it became. I could use my communication skills, combine them with my desire to work with people, and really help clients transform their lives for the better!
My new mentor insisted I take an ICF-accredited coach training course, and I’m so glad I did! I learned the foundation of true coaching: supporting the client to unlock his or her own genius! I’ve been able to work as a coach since 2007, and immediately loved it. In 2008 I started Archer Coaching, my own coaching practice, for working with professionals to create a meaningful career and a balanced life. In 2010, I earned my Associate Certified Coach credential from the International Coach Federation and began working with Roving Coach to offer coaching in corporations.
My approach to coaching is simple: I believe the client is whole, resourceful, and wise. My job is to help unleash a client’s inner genius by asking the right questions, providing a new viewpoint, and supporting him or her on the path to achievement. I am constantly amazed at what people can create, and how they make things happen in their lives. It’s an honor and a privilege to be a part of that. Coaching as a career is an excellent fit for my natural enthusiasm, optimism, curiosity, and desire to learn.

"Florence – the cultural stronghold of the Renaissance – is packed with historical architectural highlights such as the gothic cathedral Santa Maria del Fiore. Its dome was built by the architect Filippo Bruneleschi and was the first double skin-dome ever made.
Or the picturesque Ponte Vecchio, one of the oldest existing segmental arch bridges.
Recently the Italian architects of GGAF unveiled their conceptual and rather provocative projects which challenge the establishment of the cultural heritage of the city.
“One provocative and yet therapeutic response to the question on how to awaken Florence into the 21st century is to make the dome of the cathedral disappear,” say GGAF. “If for a year or so we applied a futuristic painting of the dome’s surface, making it transparent, we would be led to ponder its concealment and how its cathedral, Santa Maria del fiore, appears somehow incomplete to us, as well as Florence itself.” By doing so, the firm say, psychological disruption will present itself to encourage forward thought and remove inhibitions.",en,books

Vanderbilt returns its entire roster from a team that won 19 games but missed out on a postseason bid last season. The Commodores also added freshman guard John Jenkins, who is expected to provide the outside shooting that was sorely missing last season. Jenkins should provide instant offense to a team that ranked 11th in the SEC in scoring and made fewer 3-pointers than any team in the conference but Alabama. Now the Commodores just need center A.J. Ogilvy to stay healthy for a full season.
Vanderbilt will look for A.J. Ogilvy to become more of a force this season.
Ogilvy averaged 15.4 points and 7.1 rebounds to earn second-team All-SEC honors last season, but his season was a mild disappointment. He showed flashes of dominance late but struggled with injuries for most of the season after trying out for the Australian Olympic team the previous summer. Now that he had a chance to rest this offseason, Ogilvy could be poised for an exceptional junior season. Jeffery Taylor showed plenty of promise as a freshman and was Vanderbilt's best player at times last season. The Commodores also are looking forward to the return of Andre Walker, who tore his anterior cruciate ligament while making his first career start early in the 2008-09 season. Festus Ezeli and Steve Tchiengang give Vanderbilt size and depth.
Jenkins could have the biggest impact of any SEC freshman not playing for Kentucky. Jenkins, a 6-foot-4 shooting guard, averaged 42.3 points per game his senior year at Station Camp High in the Nashville, Tenn., suburb of Gallatin. Jeremy Beal, who delivered more than twice as many assists as turnovers last year, provides steady leadership at point guard. Brad Tinsley made 40 percent of his 3-point attempts last season and should team with Jenkins to make the Commodores a much-improved team from beyond the arc. Tinsley also has enough experience at point guard to give Beal an occasional rest.
Vanderbilt has cause for optimism even after missing out on the postseason last season. This is an experienced and deep team, and the Commodores welcome Jenkins, the No. 15 prospect in the nation. Throw in the return of a healthy Walker, and there's reason to believe Vanderbilt should earn its third NCAA tournament bid in the past four seasons.

"Monthly Archives: September 2011
European Central Bank officials have come under increasing pressure in recent weeks to step up their response to the worsening European sovereign debt crisis. These concerns hit the headlines again over the weekend when Christine Lagarde, Head of the IMF, called for immediate action, stating that the organisation had enough funds to meet its current debt obligations to debt-riddled Eurozone nations, but that if debt contagion spread to other more significant European economies, then the IMF might not be able to offer help.
However, market rumours suggest that the EU / IMF is about to announce a bold rescue plan to provide help for Eurozone nations struggling to service their current debts. The package will significantly bolster its ability to offer bail-out assistance by increasing the funds available to the ECB’s bail-out fund, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), from its current level of €440bn to €2 trillion. The increase in emergency funding should cover all potential European debt scenarios in the short-to-medium term, causing a pick-up in investor sentiment towards the Euro. However, whispers are emerging that the IMF is proposing that Greece writes down 50% of its current debt obligations to private investors, a move which would place significant pressure on the European retail banking sector.
At the moment, the currency markets are focussing on the negative element of the rumoured IMF rescue plan, causing the Euro to give up ground. This has seen the GBPEUR rate gain over 1.5c from its Friday close in this mornings trading.
To keep up to date on this ever changing situation feel free to contact me, Stephen Hughes, directly at firstname.lastname@example.org or call me on 01494 787457.
Sterling Euro exchange rates have slipped following the Bank of England Minutes this morning. Whilst Quantitative Easing was not extended this month the minutes this morning said the decision was finely balanced and the economic conditions were increasing the likelihood of its introduction. It means October’s meeting may see large volatility on rates as markets try to second guess if and when it will be introduced. Combined with Jean Claude Trichet’s speechcoming up on Friday, and the fact that the ECB may cut interest rates at their next meeting, this currency pair is likely to remain volatile. Further announcements on Italy and Greece’s financial positions are also making analysts lives very difficult. If you have a requirement ot buy or sell either currency then feel free to e-mail email@example.com or call 01494 787 465 and I would be happy to discuss your options.
A former advisor to China’s central bank has said China should stop buying Euro bonds and should only do so if certain conditions are met. Whilst Yu Yongding’s views may not represent official Chinese policy, and China has regularly expressed confidence in the Eurozone, they have yet to lay out any concrete support package should the single currency remain in trouble. China holds over a quarter of its FX reserves in Euro and so its approach to this could be instrumental in any long term solution.
Euro Dollar exchange rates have moved around 6% in the greenback’s favour over the last few weeks as the Dollar has strengthened amidst a new flight to safety, especially as the alternative option, the Swiss Franc, has been made a lot less attractive by the Swiss National Bank.
Bank of England Minutes are released in 25 minutes so will be key to short term GBP EUR rates- be ready to move quick on any news of Quantitative Easing being discussed or not.
GBP EUR exchange rates will be very much dependant on the Bank of England Minutes due out tomorrow morning. Whilst the BofE didn’t increase their asset purchase program of Quantitative Easing this month it is unclear how close they actually came to doing so; the Minutes will reveal all as to what was discussed and the markets will use the information to forecast future bank policy and price this into the exchange rate.
As a result if following some very poor UK data some members of the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee have pushed for an increase in QE then sterling Euro is likely to fall significantly. However should the bank remain optimistic about a slow but steady recovery in the UK then the pound may claw back some recent lost ground against the single currency. As the outcome is an unknown, and the scale of the movement in exchange rates potentially very large indeed, please do not hesitate to e-mail me for information once the news is published- firstname.lastname@example.org

Angela Merkel was quoted on radio today saying the Eurozone must stick together. Following a tense few days for Euro rates, we have actually seen the Euro gain back some ground against both the pound and the US dollar. This is I feel a combination of investors taking profits ( you can read more on this in my post on our sister site http://www.poundsterlingforecast.com/2011/09/13/be-fearful-when-others-are-greedy-and-greedy-when-others-are-fearful/ ) and Merkel’s comments.
I have written before that despite the huge difficulties in the Eurozone there is a huge economic and political will to keep the Euro alive. If I had to put my neck on the line I think the Euro in it’s current form is doomed. But that the doomsday scenario painted is not necessarily upon us yet. We do seem to be drawing closer however and it is only right that the Eurozone economies seriously start drawing up contingency plans. With shrinking economies and ballooning budget deficits the PIIGS situation is deteriorating. The massive losses in share price of all of the banks exposed to Eurozone debt underlines the lack of confidence that these debts will be repaid. The true extent of the crisis is perhaps better reflected in these falling stocks, since when investors look to the Euro as a currency there are a number of positives. Namely high interest rates and the participation of Germany and France, as two of the world’s largest economies in the Euro project.
Looking to data for the rest of the week ahead, we have Industrial Production orders tomorrow and Unemployment change and Inflation data Thursday. Any releases out of line with expectation could cause some movements but I would expect the biggest news this week will be political fallout from on going discussions over the future of the Euro.
In the last few days EURUSD and GBPEUR movements have been quick and sustained. If you have any trades to make why not get in touch to find out if you could be getting a better deal?

The continued turmoil in the Eurozone and within the ECB itself has given a boost to the Pound with Friday’s movment taking us to the highest levels we have seen since March.
With European Central Bank chief economist Juergen Stark resigning on Fridayspeculation of conflicts within the ECB over its bond-buying programme are rife. Stark was reportedly one of four members of the ECB who voted against last month’s controversial decision to revive a programme of buying the bonds of indebted eurozone nations.
Mr Stark’s surprise move pointed to continuing divisions in Germany over the ECB’s direction.
While in the short term we may see Sterling gain a little further ground against the Euro as a result of this uncertainty and turmoil in the long term the health of the global and European economy will weigh heavy on the pounds shoulders due to the dire need for international investment to come into the UK and the reduction in trade volume with these failing economies.
The major release this week isn’t until Thursday when we get the latest set of inflation (CPI) figures. Analysts are expecting a turn round from negative growth to positive so expect a strong Euro fightback later in the week. Those of you needing to buy the single currency who are still sitting on the fence should seriously consider making a decision prior to this announcement.
To join in my personal Euro debate feel free to contact me at email@example.com
The Euro is really suffering at the moment as evidenced by it’s recent falls against the pound and the dollar. There is a deep rift developing not just economically but also politically over how this crisis can be managed. The Eurozone debt crisis is the biggest threat to the global recovery and the outcome for the Euro rate will be affected by the decisions that are taken. The sides are basically those who are in favour of more bailouts and those not. The current status quo is clearly unsustainable with many feeling an end needs to come to the continuous flows of money emmanating from Germany to the peripheral nations. Some believe however that in order to ensure the future of the Eurozone this needs to continue until such time as they can pay their debts themselves. How long will that take?
A German court decision has confirmed that in future all bailout funds will require approval before the German parliament. This stems from the deep resentment and anger amongst German citizens for the way in which Germany, a hard working and industrious nation, is having to support other countries in the Eurozone, basically because they have mismanaged their own finances. A majority of German citizens do not see it as their responsibility to shore up the rest of Europe’s economies.
So what can they do? This German ruling will make it more difficult for countries in distress to receive funding via Germay, which will not help what is already seen as a long, slow and drawn out process. Italy and Spain are now well in the market’s sights. In July the European Central Bank bought up a huge amount of Italian and Spanish bonds to calm the markets. This had the effect of calming the markets, but did nothing to tackle the underlying problems in the Eurozone. The issue is already flaring up again and I am certain the Euro will continue to struggle. But the Euro remains very strong against the pound due to higher interest rates in the Eurozone versus the UK and the fact the pound is exceptionally weak.
We are seeing more and more problems in the Eurozone, the economic unity is slowly crumbling and clearly not working as expected. The political unity that has underlined the Euro is clearly experiencing grave difficulties too. Merkel and her party are suffering in Germany and we saw earlier this year how a Finnish far right group gained much support on the back of anti europe votes. With a growing concensus around the world that many Euro based countries will not be able to finance their debts confidence is falling.
If you have an upcoming Euro trade I would be weary of waiting for rates to improve significantly. The current range of 1.12-1.15 is due to interest rates in both countries. Until these change we will not see any major movement because interest rates are the biggest factor behind exchange rates. Further crisis in the Eurozone definitely has the potential to move the rate in favour of those buying Euros, but we don’t know exactly how this will all pan out. It is worth noting that the UK’s economic position (and consequently the pound’s) is extremely fragile and will not be able to withstand a serious financial shock that major crisis in Europe will create. The last recession was caused by credit drying up. If that happens again (i.e debts cannot be paid – or at least the markets lose faith that debts will be repaid) it is likely UK banks will suffer which will harm the UK economy and the pound. It really is not as simple as the Euro breaking up and the rates returning to 1.40 ‘just like they used to be’.
The bottom line is we just don’t know what will happen and that is the danger. If you have a currency transfer we can assist with information on what is driving the markets and that will help ensure you get the very best from the market.

With UK interest rates set to remain at 0.5% until deep into 2012 and the Euro interest rate remaining solid at 1.5% we can see why exchange rates are where they are. Some poor manufacturing sentiment data from the Eurozone showed confidence was down which has given a small spike on GBPEUR and provided a platform for the rate to break the 1.14 mark this afternoon. On a €200,000 purchase, a trade this afternoon would be £2500 cheaper that at the start of the week…
With interest rate decisions next week for the pound and the Euro we could see some further volatility that would give rise to good trading opportunity for clients. The last UK meeting saw all members vote for no change, representing a change in the policy of the committee. With all the debt problems in the Eurozone I would be very suprised to see a further rate hike on the Euro but in the speech after by Trichet we will learn some more about Euro economic policy going forward. Such events can provide the trading opportunity you are looking for.
With the challenge faced by the UK in it’s economic recovery, we are unlikely to see any major improvements for some time. By major I mean 3 or 4 cents. Put it this way I would expect to see 1.10 before 1.20! Getting the best rate is about being realistic about what is possible in current conditions and being able to take advantage of spikes – like we have seen in the last two days. Markets are moving every two seconds twenty four hours a day, three hundred and sixty five days a year. As specialist currency brokers we keep our clients informed of market developments that can save them money.

"Saginaw Bay: Those heading out 5 miles off Palmer Road caught some walleye in 12 to 18 feet of water. Small perch were caught closer to shore. Off Linwood, perch anglers caught fish a mile out and walleye were caught in the Black Hole in 20 feet of water. Near Quanicassee, perch were caught off Vanderbilt Park. A few walleye were caught 12 miles off Thomas Road and perch near Tietz Drain. A lot of anglers at Bay Port and Mud Creek, but catch rates for perch were spotty. At Caseville, a couple lake trout were taken near the breakwall.
Tittabawassee River: Is ice covered however ice conditions are poor. No fishing activity at this time.
Saginaw River: Ice conditions were improving. Most of the walleye caught were sublegal but a few keepers were reported. Small walleye were the common catch between the mouth and Saginaw. A few perch were caught from the mouth to the Independence Bridge.
SOUTHWEST LOWER PENINSULA:
St. Joseph River: Steelhead fishing has been good below the Berrien Springs Dam. Warmer weather this week should help reduce shelf ice.
Coldwater Lakes: Are producing some bluegills in the early morning or evening.
Gull Lake: Smelt, yellow perch, and lake trout are being caught.
Gun Lake: Had fair to good bluegill fishing.
Duck Lake: Producing bluegills in the early morning in 10 to 15 feet of water.
Grand River at Grand Rapids: Steelhead have been caught below the Sixth Street Dam. Watch for shelf ice.
Grand River at Lansing: A lot of pike have been caught on minnows below the dams at Moore's Park and North Lansing. Walleye were caught at both locations.
Jordan Lake: Perch and bluegills were caught just off the bottom.
Lake Lansing: Producing a lot of pike on tip-ups with sucker minnows. Most of the fish are running small but anglers are having fun.
Muskrat Lake: Had decent bluegill and crappie action. Look for bluegill straight out from the boat launch and crappie along the drop-off on the west side of the lake in 10 to 16 feet of water.
Muskegon River: Some walleye were caught in the Hardy Dam Pond. Those spearing pike reported good success with some nice fish taken.
NORTHEAST LOWER PENINSULA:
Sturgeon River: More anglers are steelhead fishing but success was limited.
Burt Lake: Of the few perch caught recently, some of the fish were decent size.
Mullett Lake: Ice conditions are generally good; however, there are a few pressure cracks starting to form. Anglers should avoid those areas near the pressure cracks. A few perch were caught on minnows and wigglers in 25 to 40 feet of water. Spearing for pike and musky was slow and no reports on walleye.
Black Lake: Was producing some nice perch but catch rates were slow. A few muskie were caught.
Grand Lake: Is producing some perch and panfish. For pike and walleye, try tip-ups in Whiskey Bay or Black Bass Bay.
Van Etten Lake: Ice anglers were catching a few perch.
Higgins Lake: Smelt have been caught in the evening along the west side of the lake between Big Creek and the North State Park. The fish are suspended in 30 to 40 feet of water. Lake trout and whitefish are still in the North Bay in 80 to 100 feet of water. Try gray shiners for lake trout or wax worms and wigglers for whitefish. Those pike spearing off Sam-O-Set Park have taken fish in 15 to 18 feet of water. Perch were also caught in the same area in 20 to 40 feet of water however anglers will need to sort out the small ones. Perch can still be found off Point Detroit and Flag Point.
Houghton Lake: Nothing on panfish yet however with the warm up, bluegill and crappie should start biting. For walleye, fish the west side of the lake.
Tawas: Fishing was slow but perch anglers were still targeting waters 15 to 20 feet deep and 20 feet for walleye. Pike spearing was slow because of muddy water.
Au Gres: Produced a few walleye straight out in 32 feet of water and off Booth Road in 26 to 30 feet of water. Rumor has it pike spearing has picked up and so has the success rate south of the breakwall and in the bayous.",en,reference

PowerMizzou.com will get Tiger fans ready for fall camp like no one else. Camp opens on Thursday, August 4th. Between now and then, we will provide an in-depth preview at every position on the roster. Today, we look at the defensive line.
Nowhere is Missouri more loaded than at defensive end. Jacquies Smith and Brad Madison have a chance to be the league's top tandem. Inside, the starters are Terrell Resonno and a healthy Dominique Hamilton for now.
On the edge, Kony Ealy evoked talk of Aldon Smith all spring. Brayden Burnett and Michael Sam should be in the mix as well. If needed, Shane Ray could lend some depth, though a redshirt seems more likely. Inside, Jimmy Burge is back, along with Marvin Foster and Lucas Vincent, who drew high praise over the summer. But the key question here is two-fold: Will Sheldon Richardson be on campus for the first fall practice (it is expected he will) and just how good can he be? Richardson is an elite talent. It will not be a surprise to see him in the starting lineup by the time the Big 12 season begins.
How often can you lose a top ten player in the NFL Draft and still feel confident his position is the best on the roster? That's where Missouri is at defensive end. Inside, Hamilton's return is huge. Resonno played well and good things have been said about Vincent and Foster. But Richardson is really the wild card here. He has the ability to take a very good defensive line and make it the best in the conference.
Is Richardson ready to go? Does his presence light a fire under Resonno? Is Hamilton the same player he was before an ankle injury? All questions that have to be answered in camp.
Madison is a pre-season all-Big 12 player. Smith could be one. Hamilton has that ability as does Richardson. We're not saying the Tigers are going to have four all-conference players on the defensive line. That would be ridiculous. We are saying they have a chance to have the best front four in the league.
Nobody covers the Tigers year-round like PowerMizzou.com. All of our previews leading up to the first practice will be free content. If you are not yet a member, just try out our free trial.",en,web

SOTE was cool, moreso for the whole multimedia onsluaght that came with it - the games, OST etc.
Still, and with no aplogies, the NJO series is my favourite. You have to admire the planning that has gone into it - 19 books, plus 2 ebooks, almost a dozen authors, all linking in many diverse aspects of the EU. If you can remember at the start of one of the Force heretic books, there is this quote from some obscure leader many would never have heard of before, that was just the authors' way of showing off that they were so EU savvy that they had read rpg sourcebooks........ gosh, Farlander even got a mention in the NJO, and his/his family was originally just a short story that came with the tie fighter pc game !

"The Craftsman - 1867
The Provincial Grand Lodge of Nova Scotia, under the jurisdiction of the Grand Lodge of Scotland, have done a very foolish thing, which they will regret before many months elapse, in issuing the following proclamation:- ""Whereas at a special convocation of the Provincial Grand Lodge of Nova Scotia, under the jurisdiction of the M.W. the Grand Lodge of Scotland, holden at Freemason's Hall, in this city, on Thursday evening, the 13th inst., the following resolution was unanimously adopted, viz:- ""Whereas, it has come to the knowledge of this Provincial Grand Lodge, that a number of the brethren belonging to the Scottish Lodges in the Province have illegally and unconstitutionally attempted to throw off their allegiance to the parent Grand Lodge of Scotland, and hold meetings for Masonic purposes, under no authority except that of the so-called Grand Lodge of Nova Scotia, in defiance of the directions of the said Grand Lodge of Scotland.
""Resolved, that the R.W.

"Nikhil Agarwal uses his mobile phone to search Google maps more than to make calls. The 29-year-old marketing professional has to travel extensively in the course of his job and needs to find his way around strange cities and unknown towns. For Nikhil, the map in his palm is a blessing. He says this was why he upgraded to a GPS-enabled mobile. He knew it would simplify life.
Nikhil's experience illustrates a truth now universally acknowledged. A mobile phone is no longer merely a portable alternative to a landline. It can have so much more. Reasonably priced feature-rich handsets may have qwerty keypads, wider screens, touch interfaces. The mobile is increasingly becoming the multi-tasking workhorse of the 21st century:
enabling the user to surf the net, access emails, get directions, shop or stay in touch with friends on social networking sites.
According to Opera, a popular mobile web browser, page viewing on Indian mobiles has grown 322% from May 2009. It says the number of unique users has grown 324% in the same period. That's not surprising, considering Vinay Goel, Google India products' head, says, that ""the number of mobile users in India with data plans (that allow you to use the internet) has increased 10-fold, from 2.5 million to 25 million in the last two years.""
Goel says that almost all phones sold in India today are GPRS-enabled. GPRS or General Packet Radio Service, allows internet access at speeds of anywhere between 56 and 114 kbps. ""Besides the 25 million data plan users, there are an additional 70-80 million using GPRS-enabled phones to download operator applications like ring-tones and wallpapers,"" he says. But the phone is handy in other ways too.
BOOK TICKETS: Thulasidaran M, a Bangalore-based tech writer, confesses he has quite forgotten the long queues he stood in for years at railway reservation counters. Today, he uses his mobile to book tickets on the Indian Railways website. ""I can even book my tickets while travelling,"" he says.
HOME SHOPPING: Then there is the shopping. Mobile purchasing is still a nascent phenomenon, but it is undoubtedly catching on. The mall has literally come to your phone as companies tie-up with stores, allowing you to buy almost anything from the comfort of your home. There are a slew of players – Ngpay, mChek, Obopay, Atom Technologies, Paymate – that enable the purchase of airline, railway, bus and movie tickets, pay utility bills and insurance premiums and make hotel bookings.
TUNE IN: The mobile has also put music at everyone's fingertips. Shubha C S works at Bengaluru International Airport and says FM radio is a boon. ""I spend three hours travelling daily. The only time I relax is when I shut my eyes and
listen to music on my mobile,"" she says.
MOTHER'S HELP: The mobile has become an extraordinary help for the harassed mother. Geetanjali S says she regularly searches the mobile's web browser for new games to amuse her six-year-old. ""When his friends are not around to play, he throws a tantrum. He is bored of the games I have on my mobile. So I keep finding new ones,"" she explains.
CHEAP INTERNET: Mobile internet has become fairly affordable, with costs coming down almost 300% over the last couple of years. Goel says that Aircel's monthly internet plan for Rs 95 triggered a revolution. ""India is now among the top five countries for data traffic. Data plans here are cheaper than anywhere else. And only a tiny fraction of internet traffic is through high-end phones.""
Now, Airtel offers internet vouchers starting at just Rs 7. ""I was surprised when the 15-year-old son of a farmer in Dharwad told me that he uses his pocket money (Rs 100) for phone internet. The cost has influenced rural penetration too,"" says Venkatesh V, CEO of mobile services for Bharti Airtel's Karnataka operations.
BSNL has made it still more attractive. ""Customers purchasing a 3G data card from BSNL are given free data usage of 6 GB per month,"" says D M Ezhil Buddhan, director (southern region) in the Department of Telecommunications. 3G will further marginalize voice on the mobile phone, given the extremely high internet speeds it promises. Already, BSNL 3G offers TV on the cellphone. Videos will catch on too.
Unsurprisingly, app stores have become treasure troves. There are more than 2.25 lakh apps in the iPhone store and 60,000 in Google's Android store. Some are severely useful, helping track daily calorie intake. Some are fairly barmy, reproducing, say, the moo of a cow (Hello Cow) or tricking people into believing your phone can detect smells (Smell Scanner).
Now, Indian telecom operators are creating their own app stores. When Bharti Airtel opened its mobile application store – Airtel App Central – earlier this year, it clocked over 2.5 m downloads in just one month. ""Now, we have over 1,500 apps for downloads and these are as low as Re 1 per day,"" says Venkatesh of Bharti Airtel. The apps range across 25 categories, including business, games, books and social networking.
The future seems bright. Micromax has introduced phones that double up as a remote for the TV, DVD and AC. Texas Instruments has helped build what is called a DLP Pico projector into cellphones, which allows one to take a picture or a video and share them instantly on any surface that can take a big projected image.
In short, that little device in your hand is becoming the way to achieve almost anything and everything.",en,web
"To nurture faith in people’s hearts through music which serves the Lord’s ministry of Word and Sacrament.
The word “mission” is a pretty bold word. Although most corporations have “mission” statements these days, such statements risk claiming more for an enterprise than it ought. And yet, in all humility, we do need goals, and people need to know what purposes a company is trying to accomplish. What ends does it serve?
Ultimately, only God knows the purposes He has for us, but we do believe He has given us the gift of music to magnify His Word, and so Liturgy Solutions seeks to use this gift for His purposes: to nurture faith in people’s hearts, that they may attain the fullness of life created for them in Christ Jesus. We believe the best way for music to serve the Gospel is for it to serve the Lord’s ministry of Word and Sacrament in the Divine Service. Our small part in this holy work is simply to provide music--mostly choral, but some solo and instrumental--that works well with the liturgy, psalmody, and hymnody of the Church.
Liturgy Solutions was founded in 2005 in order to achieve these noble ends. Most of our work, especially originally, was focused on providing music for the liturgy as it finds expression in the appointed readings and psalmody of the Lutheran Service Book, the most recent official hymnal of the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod, in which our composers are in fellowship. Our first publications therefore were seasonal booklets that provided church musicians with a variety of psalms, verses, and hymn stanzas they could use during a particular season of the Church Year. Today, however, our music in our catalog is also available by single piece, so that musicians can get “just the Verse they want” and so that musicians in other communions can locate individual Psalms or hymn stanzas they might find useful in their worship.
We continue to add pieces to our catalog every month. With our new, expanded format, you will begin to find more pieces for summer and fall, alongside our extensive listings for Advent, Christmas, Epiphany, Lent, and Easter. This coming year we will also offer music for some of the fall festivals, original hymn concertatos, alternative accompaniments for select songs, and even a setting of the Divine Service.
We have made these improvements based upon feedback from our clients. They have come up with some great ideas for helping us serve the church, and we pray our new efforts will bear good fruit for the Gospel. If you have additional ideas that might help us further our mission: To nurture faith in people’s hearts through music which serves the Lord’s ministry of Word and Sacrament.",en,reference

"Concepts of human behavior contribute at least as much to the physician's skills as his concepts of anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, bacteriology, pharmacology, or pathology. The complaints of the patient rarely originate in biological disturbance alone, but rather include a liberal admixture of psychosocial dysfunction. Still, human behavior often baffles physicians far more than the most complex disturbances of anatomy or physiology. Too often, the most devastating organic disease is attacked with less fear and more enthusiasm than any maladjustment of the patient's social or psychological relationships.
Paul R. Miller of the Northwestern University Medical School has designed his new book, Sense and Symbol, to present human behavior with the same objectivity as the physician views other basic medical sciences. All systems of man's behavior, whether biological, psychological, or social, are viewed with the kind of comprehensive perspective the internist aspires to see.

"There’s no question that wood cabinet hardware is a natural choice for those who want to create an earthy feel in their space. The addition of wood handles, wood knobs and wood pulls to any room adds warmth, character and distinction without costing a fortune. Just as trees live for years and still stand gracefully, wood handles and wood knobs are easy to install and designed to endure years of usage.
Wood cabinet hardware is available in a variety of different wood types, each of which has its own unique grain and color varieties. Homeowners who want to integrate their wood knobs or wood handles seamlessly into their space can choose unfinished wood cabinet hardware that can be easily painted to match the color of the walls or the décor of the room. With their golden brown color and smooth surface, oak knobs and oak pulls are increasingly popular for spaces with a rustic design or a lightly-colored motif. Oak knobs can be adorned with metal trim or design for additional style, while traditional oak pulls can be found in a range of drill centers - perfect for replacing old cabinet hardware or creating a new look. Likewise, homeowners can find a maple handle with almost any drill center and use it to update the look of any existing cabinetry.
Wood handles, wood knobs and wood pulls are perfect for country-styled spaces, rustic retreats and other warm spaces. Because wood cabinet hardware is available in a variety of wood types and grains, wood hardware can be selected to match any furniture, cabinets or kitchen accessories, creating a tasteful, integrated look in any space.",en,reference

It's been a while since we were involved in a creative for a magazine ... but when one of Canada’s most respected event planning professionals Cynthia Martyn Events contacted us back in July, how could we say no?!?!
Actually, at first we did say no, haha, ... but fortunately we were able to massage our schedules to make it work ... and we're so happy we did!! Check out the results in the recently released Winter/Spring 2012 issue of WedLuxe Magazine ... pages 68 - 70.
Basically, the idea behind the photoshoot was to gleen inspiration from a favoured designer (Cynthia chose famed housewares and accessories designer Jonathan Adler as her muse) and then translate it into a wedding day design!",en,web

i just read the article by dr nelson on treatment interuptions. i was undiagnosed for 8-10 yrs. then when i found out, in 94, i still avoided meds. i finally started them in 96. but i went off again in april 2000 and am still off. of course ur gonna lose cd's in the first 3 months off meds.. also ur VL goes up. so what? ur immune system will catch up. if not, then the patient will know they are not candidates for sti. my t's stablized and so did my VL. i'm doin fine.. i think sti are a very good tool for treatment. i know i'd be dead if i was still on meds. the side effects are horrendous for me. i think u doctors are really scaring patients way too much. u do that to scare them into adherence but in the long run, i think it's has negative results. i hope, when i ever go back on meds, to do the pulse treatment. how r u ever gonna get good research results when u scare most patients away from any form of sti's? over 2 1/2 yrs aprx i have gone from 900 t's to 340, and my VL from UND to 200,000. that's not all of that bad. but i can hear patients intake of breathes. that's b-cuz they have been terrorized into thinking that they will die if their VL goes that high. i'm no where near death. u docs have got to shape ur patients treatment to them. not ur case books. i bet my life that their are tons of people on meds that would do very well on some kind of sti. save their organs big time. why do u insist on terrorizing us?
| Response from Dr. Boyle
I don't think anyone is out to terrorize you or anyone else. Clinicians treating HIV patients want them to do well, and that means helping them in every way they can, including the appropriate use of antiretrovirals. Admittedly, we don't have all the answers but, at the same time, we are actively trying to find out what works and what doesn't. The data to date indicate relatively strongly that for some people (generally those who have never had a T cell count below 200), interrupting therapy with careful monitoring is probably OK. On the other hand, however, for patients who have had T cells less than 200, at any time, interrupting therapy may entail some risk, including a risk of new or recurrent opportunistic infections. So, while I am happy that you have done relatively well, we have to base treatment decisions on more that the results of just one patient. I think most patients understand, expect and appreciate that and I hope that after thinking about it you do too.

"Now let's check the drives out in FC-Test. Running a little ahead, we can tell you that it produces the same general picture as CrystalDisk Mark except for one nuance.
The Kingston beats the opposition in the read test and is followed by the external HDD from Seagate. The remaining flash drives deliver similar performance, the Transcend being just a little better than the Silicon Power at reading.
The picture isn't so clear in the test of writing although we've got the same pairs of leaders and losers.
The Kingston DataTraveler Ultimate G2 is slower than the external HDD when writing a single large file, but goes ahead with medium and small files.
Oddly enough, the second-generation Kingston performs very differently in the write tests from CrystalDisk Mark and FC-Test. Compared to the first-generation model we tested in our previous review, it is slower in every write test from CrystalDisk Mark except for sequential writing. FC-Test, which is closer to real-life applications, produces a completely different picture: the second-generation model is somewhat faster than its predecessor in each mode.
The Silicon Power is ahead of the Transcend in terms of sequential writing but the latter is better with small and medium-sized files. The Transcend is overall the faster drive in this pair.
Compared to the Kingmax ED-01 from our previous test session, these products are somewhat slower when writing a single large file, but faster with small and medium-sized files where the Kingmax failed completely. This may be due to the difference in the USB 3.0 controllers, though (the ASMedia controller proved to be faster than the EtronTech when writing small files to a fast flash drive, but we guess we should leave this topic for a comprehensive review of USB 3.0 controllers).
The Kingston DataTraveler Ultimate 3.0 G2 is surely the star product of this review. It proved to be superior to the other two USB 3.0 flash drives in every parameter and could even challenge the external HDD. So if you used to prefer portable HDDs for their speed rather than storage capacity, it's time to switch to modern flash drives which deliver the same performance but are much easier to handle. Rather large for a flash drive, the DataTraveler Ultimate 3.0 G2 is still much smaller than an external HDD.
The Transcend JetFlash 700 and Silicon Power Blaze B10 can also be considered as rather fast portable storage media if you don't mind their low write speed, especially with medium-sized and small files. These two are quite fast at reading files of any size and do not slow down much when writing large files. They are affordable and comparable to ordinary USB 2.0 products in price. Somewhat faster and cheaper, the Transcend JetFlash 700 may seem more appealing than the Silicon Power Blaze B10. But again, you must be aware of their ambiguous speed characteristics. They are fast when reading or when writing large files, but are no better than regular USB 2.0 flash drives when writing small files. They were also inferior in speed to the external HDD.",en,reference
"Windows NT is a family of operating systems produced by Microsoft, the first version of which was released in July 1993. It was originally designed to be a powerful high-level-language-based, processor-independent, multiprocessing, multiuser operating system with features comparable to Unix. It was intended to complement consumer versions of Windows that were based on MS-DOS. NT was the first fully 32-bit version of Windows, whereas its consumer-oriented counterparts, Windows 3.1x and Windows 9x, were 16-bit/32-bit hybrids. Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, Windows Home Server, and Windows Server 2008 are based upon the Windows NT system, although they are not branded as Windows NT.
Windows NT 3.1 was the first version of Windows to utilize 32-bit ""flat"" virtual memory addressing on 32-bit processors. Its companion product, Windows 3.1, used segmented addressing and switches from 16-bit to 32-bit addressing in pages.
Windows NT 3.1 featured a core kernel providing a system API, running in supervisor mode, and a set of user-space environments with their own APIs which included the new Win32 environment, an OS/2 1.3 text-mode environment and a POSIX environment. The full preemptive multitasking kernel could interrupt running tasks to schedule other tasks, without relying on user programs to voluntarily give up control of the CPU, as in Windows 3.1.
Notably, in Windows NT 3.x, several I/O driver subsystems, such as video and printing, were user-mode subsystems. In Windows NT 4, the video, server and printer spooler subsystems were integrated into the kernel. Windows NT's first GUI was strongly influenced by (and programmatically compatible with) that from Windows 3.1; Windows NT 4's interface was redesigned to match that of the brand new Windows 95, moving from the Program Manager to the Start Menu/Taskbar design.
NTFS, a journaled, secure file system, was created for NT. NT also allows for other installable file systems, and with versions 3.1 and 3.51, NT could also be installed on DOS's FAT or OS/2's HPFS file systems. Later versions could be installed on a FAT partition gaining speed at the expense of security, but this option is no longer present in Windows Vista.
Microsoft hired a group of developers from Digital Equipment Corporation led by Dave Cutler to build Windows NT, and many elements of the design reflect earlier DEC experience with Cutler's VMS and RSX-11. The operating system was designed to run on multiple instruction set architectures and multiple hardware platforms within each architecture. The platform dependencies are largely hidden from the rest of the system by a kernel mode module called the HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer).
Windows NT's kernel mode code further distinguishes between the ""kernel"", whose primary purpose is to implement processor and architecture dependent functions, and the ""executive"". This has led some writers to refer to the kernel as a microkernel, but the Windows NT kernel no longer meets many of the criteria of a ""microkernel"", although this was the original goal of chief architect Cutler. Both the kernel and the executive are linked together into the single loaded module ntoskrnl.exe; from outside this module there is little distinction between the kernel and the executive. Routines from each are directly accessible, as for example from kernel-mode device drivers.
API sets in the Windows NT family are implemented as subsystems atop the publicly undocumented ""native"" API; it was this that allowed the late adoption of the Windows API (into the Win32 subsystem). Windows NT was one of the earliest operating systems to use Unicode internally.

The first release was given version number 3.1 to match the contemporary 16-bit Windows; magazines of that era claimed the number was also used to make that version seem more reliable than a '.0' release. There were also some issues related to Novell IPX protocol licensing, which was apparently limited to 3.1 versions of Windows software.
The NT version number is no longer used for marketing purposes, but is still used internally, and said to reflect the degree of changes to the core of the operating system. The build number is an internal figure used by Microsoft's developers and beta testers.
In order to prevent Intel x86-specific code from slipping into the operating system by developers used to developing on x86 chips, Windows NT 3.1 was initially developed using non-x86 development systems and then ported to the x86 architecture. This work was initially based on the Intel i860-based Dazzle system and, later, the MIPS R4000-based Jazz platform. Both systems were designed internally at Microsoft.
Windows NT 3.1 was released for Intel x86 PC compatible, DEC Alpha, and ARC-compliant MIPS platforms. Windows NT 3.51 added support for the PowerPC processor in 1995, specifically PReP-compliant systems such as the IBM Power Series desktops/laptops and Motorola PowerStack series; but despite meetings between Michael Spindler and Bill Gates, significantly not on the Power Macintosh.
Only two of the Windows NT 4.0 variants (IA-32 and Alpha) have a full set of service packs available. All of the other ports done by third parties (Motorola, Intergraph, etc.) have few, if any, publicly available updates.
Windows NT 4.0 was the last major release to support Alpha, MIPS, or PowerPC, though development of Windows 2000 for Alpha continued until August 1999, when Compaq stopped support for Windows NT on that architecture; and then three days later Microsoft also canceled their AlphaNT program, even though the Alpha NT 5 (Windows 2000) release had reached RC2 (build 2128).
Released versions of NT for Alpha were 32-bit only. The 64 bit port of Windows was originally intended to run on Itanium as well as on Alpha, and Alpha hardware was accordingly used internally at Microsoft during early development of 64-bit Windows. This continued for some time after Microsoft publicly announced that it was cancelling plans to ship 64-bit Windows for Alpha, because Itanium hardware was not yet available for development.
Limited Editions of Windows 2000 Advanced Server and Datacenter Server, Windows XP 64-Bit, and Windows Server 2003 Enterprise and Datacenter support Intel's IA-64 processors. As of 25 April 2005 Microsoft had released four editions for 'x64' (see x86-64 architecture): Windows XP Professional x64 Edition, Windows Server 2003 Standard x64 Edition, Windows Server 2003 Enterprise x64 Edition, and Windows Server 2003 Datacenter x64 Edition.

The project's earlier name was NT OS/2. Another of the original OS/2 3.0 developers, Mark Lucovsky, states that the name was taken from the Intel i860 processor—code-named N10 (or 'N-Ten') —which served as the original target hardware. Various Microsoft publications, including a 1998 question-and-answer session with Bill Gates, reveal that the letters were expanded to 'New Technology' for marketing purposes but no longer carry any specific meaning.
It is popularly believed that Dave Cutler intended the initialism 'WNT' as a pun on VMS, incrementing each letter by one, similar to the apocryphal story of Arthur C. Clarke's deriving HAL 9000's name by decrementing each letter of IBM.
The letters were dropped from the name of Windows 2000, though literature contained the phrase 'Built on NT technology' and the system folder retained the WINNT designation. This action ostensibly reflected Microsoft's intent to unify its home and business lines, then represented by Windows 98 and Windows NT 4.0, but this goal would not be fully achieved until the introduction of Windows XP.

"Alumni Spotlight: Rod Landness
History meets modern ingenuity in Richmond’s historic Depot District, and Rod, BA’09, and Kiera Landess are steadfast in carving out a niche of their own.
Here, abandoned warehouses, a collapsing train depot and the city’s oldest firehouse are getting new life as budding entrepreneurs create a reawakening in the city’s once-forgotten business district. The Landesses, in fact, are using a piece of the past as their company’s namesake.
The Richmond couple is co-owners of the New Boswell Brewing Company named after Ezra Boswell, a school teacher and city clerk, who in 1816 opened “Boswell’s,” the first brewery in the city and state. The original brewery was located not far from where the Landesses have planted their entrepreneurial roots at 413 N. Eighth St.
“It’s coming up on 100 years since there’s been a brewery in town,” said Rod Landess. “And it’s really a bridge between the modern beer and what most microbreweries are making right now.”
Rod left IU East with a bachelor’s degree and a newfound enthusiasm for entrepreneurship to create the business, which brews ales inspired by traditional American beers. He hit the ground running after commencement.
“It’s been a steady amount of work since graduation for me last year,” Rod said. “I went directly from all that work on finals week, to starting the brewery immediately after finals. I started moving into the building and getting that ready. The whole summer was just working all day and driving back and forth. I got to the point where I was ready to open, but I had to work my day job, too.”
The venture got a boost through an Indiana start-up grant worth up to $10,000 in order to become established as a wholesaler to local bars and restaurants. The Landesses also spent the past summer promoting their products at weekend festivals across the region. In the long term, the couple plan to develop the business’ store front, ramp up production and offer resources to fellow microbrewers. At the same time, Rod continues to work in Richmond Community Schools’ information technology department while Kiera operates a web design business of her own.
“We’re at the point where we can sell the beer,” Rod said. “We haven’t been able to get out and make enough of it. I’ve been brewing once or twice a week.”
The company’s early success follows a tried-and-true business concept.
“Rod is a thinker,” said Tim Scales, Landess’ former professor, and IU East’s director of the Center for Entrepreneurship. “He’s a moderate risk-taker. He’s not going to take on something that’s foolish.
“Rod is doing the model that I actually teach often,” he said. “That’s start small, start slow and test the market. As the market accepts you, build up as you can.”
Neighboring Depot District businesses have already rolled out the red carpet for the couple. The 4th Floor Blues Club hosted the company’s grand opening on St. Patrick’s Day, an event that ended with lots of “empty cups.” And Steve Terzini, the owner of Little Sheba’s restaurant and Zini’s place, a bar, is the company’s top customer.
“It’s cool,” Terzini said. “I’d love to see it (the company’s storefront) so you can walk in and taste the beers.”
Terzini has carried New Boswell’s brown and cream ales — one at a time— and is quick to offer them to his customers who are looking to try something new.
“I tell them, ‘We have a local brew, you want to try it?’ ” Terzini said. “We’ve sold a lot of it.”
Soon, New Boswell will also make a special brew that will be sold at the Firehouse BBQ & Blues, a restaurant opening in Richmond’s oldest firehouse.
The brewery is one of about thirty in the state, about the same number of breweries that existed before National Prohibition shut down all legitimate operations in 1918, according to the Brewers Guild of Indiana.
The Landesses say interest in their company has been wide ranging.
“Some people have called the Brewers Guild of Indiana to find out what’s going on in Indiana and they will send them our way,” Rod said. “We had a guy who was starting a brewery in Florida who stopped by to see our setup. It’s been really surprising.”
The couple has found that they fit well in to a fraternity of sorts of beer makers.
“Everyone seems so friendly,” Kiera Landess said. “You’re never without friends when you’re a brewer.”
“It’s kind of a little club,” Rod said. “Everyone says that there are only nice people in brewing. They are really open about technique and ingredients. Having a recipe doesn’t mean you know how to make the beer.
“We’ve even had people volunteer to let us try out their equipment, to brew beer on their system and to learn a bit more about how that works,” he said.
Despite the support and excitement surrounding their business, getting started has been a challenge.
“Stress has been a big issue,” Rod said. “Like managing the stress and being able to work the hours we’re working, both of us.”
“Every time you reach a new point where you had never been this stressed before in your life, at least you know that if you get through that, you’ll always be able to get to that point again.
“Once I just have the brewery to worry about, we’ll be good.”",en,web

"It might sound crazy to get excited about a stock trade that will potentially cap your gains and leave you with plenty of downside losses. After all the reason most people get into investing is to get rich and grow their money. However, seasoned investors will tell you that patience is a virtue. After all, Wall Street wasn't built in a day (that goes for Main Street too). So, sometimes it pays to be patient and take the profits that are put in front of you, instead of just hoping for that big once in a lifetime gain.
Investors in Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc. (GMCR), Tesla Motors, Inc. (TSLA) and Arch Coal Inc. (ACI) can find that there are some amped up covered call trades your portfolio needs. Each company brings us energy in their very own unique ways, but more importantly, the volatility on the common stocks of these companies creates opportunities to sell calls and profit from the time value decay of the options.
Green Mountain Coffee Roasters brings us our caffeine fix every day with branded coffee products. Investors in this stock could consider an out-of-the-money covered call sale. The November 2012 $23 strike price call option sells for a time value premium of $2.63. It has no intrinsic value and will only provide the buyer of the option with a payoff if the shares rise significantly above the strike price at expiration. For the seller of the call option, it can provide a limited and profitable upside. If the investor is lucky enough to see their shares rise above the $23 strike price, then they will automatically be assigned at expiration, bringing the investor a 15.3% profit over that 39 day period. If shares trade unchanged, the investor pockets the call premium and continues to hold their shares, keeping a nice portfolio yield of 13.0%. The break-even for the trade is $19.94 per share.
Tesla Motors is a start-up that is focusing on the electric vehicle market and having limited success with their upscale models like the Tesla Roadster. The holders of Tesla stock could consider selling an out-of-the-money call option to take advantage of the rich options premium on the November 2012 $29 strike price call option, which has a bid price of $1.55. If shares rise above the $29 strike price at or before expiration, then the shares could be called sending a 6.5% profit to traders holding for about 39 days. If shares trade unchanged, the call option premium represents a 5.5% portfolio yield to the investor, which is about a 51.2% annualized return. The break-even price for the trade is $27.22.
Arch Coal does exactly what it sounds like it does. Investors holding the common stock shares could consider selling the $7 strike price November 2012 call option for $0.61. This out-of-the-money call could generate a return of 13.1% over 39 days if shares rise above $7 and stay there at expiration. Otherwise, if shares trade flat the premium received from selling the calls will generate a yield of 9.2%, or an annualized return of 85%. The break-even price on the trade is about $6.19.

"Alright, so, I’m a fifteen-year-old girl currently doing grade ten. I eat far too much in the way of carbs, but other than that, I’m not too unhealthy. I procrastinate; I’m not the best friend to have due to my laziness; and I’ve never felt like I belonged anywhere.
My problem is this: why do I get so utterly furious so often? Sure — teenage girl, raging hormones, blah, blah, blah — but the tiniest things can set me off, then I’m crying and yelling, often with a mixture of utter rage and guilt boiling in my gut. If this were ‘normal’, the world would have torn itself to shreds by now.
There is no history of abuse of any kind in my family, no alcoholics, nothing. I can’t be myself around my family, but then again, can anyone? However, with my father sometimes the sound of his voice literally makes me want to hit him. I love him dearly, but he makes me so mad at the tiniest comment, it’s ridiculous!
Is there anything I can do to control my rage (especially with my father!)?
Our Clinical Psychologist’s Reply
You began your question by mentioning a few things: a tendency to procrastinate, a sense of not fitting in, an idea of yourself as lazy, and the sense that you cannot be yourself with your family. I understand that these are not the issues you are concerned about, but I mention them because I wonder if they contribute to the bigger picture of your mood and reactions.
Procrastinating can create stress as the deadline approaches. And I wondered if you have gotten negative feedback from peers about being “lazy.” Conflict with peers, feeling as if you do not fit, and feeling as if you cannot be yourself with your family: these things put together seem to me to leave you with few places or people with whom you are at ease or even happy. If academic stress, a lack of satisfying social relationships, and disconnection within your family do not leave you feeling irritable and/or angry, I would be surprised! For teenagers especially, school and friends are two very important arenas that contribute to both how you feel and how you think of yourself. If you are feeling less than successful with friends, as well as with schoolwork, it would make sense to me if this was spilling over into your mood and temper.
Now, with that said, while it could be these experiences causing you to have a short or intense temper, it may be something else. Without ruling out more concrete medical or mental health causes for your anger and rage, we would not be able to say for sure.
You stated that you have not been abused or had to deal with alcoholism in your family. This is good. But I wonder about other ways that your experiences and your family’s mental health history could be playing into what you are experiencing. You did not mention whether mood disorders (such as depression or bipolar disorder) or other mental health problems (such as ADHD or other impulse control disorders) run in your family.
So, I have mentioned circumstances as well as biological causes. However, most often it is not either/or. Typically, it is both/and. What I mean is, what is inside you (neurochemistry and hormones) and what is going on outside you (situations and relationships) interact together to cause behavior. For example, if depression runs in your family, you might be predisposed to have a low or irritable mood. This may never occur, but if you were to add in an ongoing stressful situation at school, conflict with friends, or a culture of perfectionism and criticism in your family (just as an example), you might find that depression symptoms are triggered.
So, regardless of the cause, you are wondering what you can do to control your temper. Sometimes it can be helpful to identify a pattern with regard to what is making you angry. For example, when your father says X, Y or Z, it really sets you off. If you can start to see how certain kinds of comments he makes or ways that he interacts with you trigger you, then you can consider speaking with him about it. Often in these situations, it is best for people to approach a sensitive topic when they are feeling calm, rather than mentioning it in a moment of anger. For example, one might say, “I’ve noticed that when you comment about X, Y, or Z, I feel really frustrated.” Often when approached calmly, people are willing to discuss ways of changing the problem together.
However, sometimes they are not! Let’s imagine that your father is going to continue to say the things he says that make you mad, no matter what. There are a few strategies you can use in the moment. Deep, abdominal breathing can help your body move from the physical agitation that anger can bring, over to a more relaxed state. Breathe, filling your belly with air, as you count to three. Hold the breath for three counts, and then blow it slowly out as you count to three again. If you do this several times, you might find that you feel more calm. Another anger management technique is to “talk back” to your anger in the moment to avoid acting out in a way that will worsen the problem. For example, you might say something in your head to yourself such as, “I am feeling really angry, but I can wait to say what I need to say.” You can also search online for additional information about anger management for teens.
It is absolutely normal to have feelings of irritation, anger, even rage at times. However, if these feelings are beginning to feel like the norm instead of the exception, you might find that speaking to an adult and obtaining help is a next step. For some kids, parents are the first people in whom they want to confide. If you are not comfortable talking to your parents or other family members, your pediatrician or school counselor might be a neutral, safe adult who can offer ideas or point you in a direction to get some help.",en,reference
"After installing Ubuntu 12.04 on a Toshiba NB510 the screen resolution is 800x600 instead of the native 1024x600. This is a netbook that contains the infamous GMA3650 (aka PowerVR SGX5450) which is poorly supported by the Linux kernel. I've looked around and tried several different solutions. Namely:
- I've tried installing a newer kernel (3.3+), since some people have reported success with it. That didn't seem to fix the resolution problem.
- I've tried installing an older version of Ubuntu (10.04), since someone suggested there's an older driver that should provide basic support for the card, but the liveCD image wouldn't boot.
- I've tried using this ppa. On first reboot, the screen resolution was correct. Subsequent reboots lead to a blank screen immediately after grub.
- I've tried passing the kernel option
video=1024x600with the above PPA, to no avail.
- I've tried installing a daily build of Quantal. The live image boots with the correct resolution. The installed system boots to a blank screen. The
video=1024x600option doesn't work here either.
- On Quantal I've blacklisted the
gma500_gfxdriver to force the use of
vesa. This causes Ubuntu to boot into a 800x600 resolution.
After this, I've tried using the following
Section ""Device"" Identifier ""card"" Driver ""vesa"" EndSection Section ""Monitor"" Identifier ""panel"" Modeline ""1024x600_DDC"" 54.03 1024 1048 1184 1344 600 603 609 670 -hsync -vsync Option ""PreferredMode"" ""1024x600_DDC"" EndSection Section ""Screen"" Identifier ""screen"" Device ""card"" Monitor ""panel"" DefaultDepth 24 SubSection ""Display"" Depth 24 Modes ""1024x600_DDC"" EndSubSection EndSection
where the modeline comes from DDC, as reported in
/var/log/Xorg.0.log. This seems to have no effect, with the resolution stuck at 800x600.
- Additionally, adding
nomodesetto the kernel command line does not help with either the resolution problem or the blank-screen problem.
Ideally, since I don't think I can trust the
gma500_gfx driver or that from Meego (the one in Sarvatt's PPA), I would like to use the
vesa driver (probably reverting to 12.04), and specify the resolution in a
xorg.conf file, but I can't seem to get this to work. Any ideas?

"Cabaret Review by Stephen Hanks
""You don't have to review this show, just relax and enjoy it,"" Lauren Fox told me at around 10:30 pm last night at the Metropolitan Room, before she and the all-star cast she assembled for the one-shot benefit show, Cabaret Rocks the Rockaways, tried to squeeze in one last mini-rehearsal. Unlike some cabaret performers who might say that to a reviewer due to fear a show may not be quite ready for judgement, Fox exuded sincerity even though she and her troop had managed just one full rehearsal-at her parents' home yet.
Fox came up with the idea for a benefit show in early December after witnessing first-hand some of the devastation that hit New York's Rockaways--the vulnerable Queens community on the peninsula of Long Island--during early November's Hurricane Sandy. This rising cabaret young star with an angelic face and voice was also an angel of mercy in the aftermath of the storm, trekking out with some of her friends and cabaret buddies to places like Breezy Point with a plethora of supplies and a wealth of good cheer. Last night's show, the box office proceeds of which will go to Rockaways relief efforts, was a natural outgrowth-but certainly not a culmination-of Fox and company's efforts to help thousands in that area who are still trying to rebuild their homes and their lives.
So any glitches in a fairly hastily put together variety show (a format that for the most part I do not love), could be forgiven and the reviewing mode set to off. But damn, if Lauren (right in photo, with Marissa Mulder) and a group of real cabaret pros didn't pull it off. And starting at 11:30 on a Friday night no less. Not review this show? Are you kidding? If any bunch of performers deserved some recognition for this kind of effort under tough circumstances it was this one. Somehow, I managed to take copious notes, sing along with many of the songs under my breath, and have a blast at the same time.
With a supportive and almost full house ready to rock and roll, Cabaret Rocks the Rockaways got off to a rollicking start with a powerhouse duo of Natalie Douglas and Heather Mac Rae nailing Neil Young's ""After the Gold Rush."" I got a rush when after Mac Rae sang the second verse of the song, Natalie smiled and laid her head on Heather's shoulder. Next up was a totally rocking Stacy Sullivan on Bob Dylan's ""Simple Twist of Faith."" If that wasn't enough of a departure for a singer currently dazzling the cabaret world with her Peggy Lee tribute show, Stacy came back later and produced a haunting and understated rendition of Stevie Nicks' ""Landslide,"" featuring great support from the band of Musical Director Jon Weber on piano, Ritt Henn on bass and Ted Stafford on guitar.
Although Fox is definitely more a Joni than a Janis, she had the guts to take on Joplin's ""Piece of My Heart,"" and pulled off an unplugged version featuring just Henn's bass as accompaniment. Ted Stafford, who joined the group just one day before the gig (as a fill in for Peter Calo) but definitely didn't show it, did a audience-pleasing version of the J. Geils Band hit ""Centerfold,"" which culminated (with some urging from the mischievious Henn) with a transition into a ""Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, Hey Jude"" ending riff. Heather Mac Rae (photo above) returned (with Sullivan, Douglas and Fox--oh my!--as backup) and was gloriously gospel-like on Paul Simon's ""Gone at Last."" Douglas remained on stage to beautifully backup T. Oliver Reid's subtle and soulful ""Desperado"" and you could hear the faint sound of an entire audience unable to resist singing along. The biggest surprise of the show may have been next when the usually sweet sounding Marissa Mulder channelled her inner Ann Wilson on Heart's power ballad ""Alone.""

"The Infernal Machine
James C. Petrille has every right to be concerned about the unhealthy economic state of American musicians as a group. The industry is acutely overcrowded, a condition for which one cure would be an application of the age old rule of the survival of the fittest. But Petrilo's is a different prognosis, although it involves almost as old a principle, namely that technological progress constitutes a social menace. The new record ban, according to his announcement, is not just a means of obtaining for musicians a bigger share of the $210,000,000 annual income from recordings, but a move designed to get rid of the institution permanently as a job-reducing evil.
Unfortunately for Petrillo's ever all popularity, technological progress is in favor with most Americans. It creates as well as destroys jobs, and whatever its temporary effect may be on one particular group of workers, it usually results in more benefit than loss to the general public.
But with a long history of success against hostility outside the musicians' union behind him Petrillo is facing as his most imminent danger the possibility of internal breakup.
Judging from past experience, his legal vulnerability is not so great, Several years ago, on the inspiration of a similar Petrillo ban, Congress passed the Lea Bill, which forbade the forcing of a radio station licensee to hire any more employees than necessary for the running of his station. The Act was judged unconstitutional by an Hlinois District Court in 1946 on the grounds of being indefinite, discriminatory, and a violation of the thirteenth amendment forbidding involuntary servitude. Petrillo might possibly be stopped in the courts either by an appeal from this decision, by an application of the Taft-Hartley secondary or unfair labor practices provisions, or on the basis of some new law not yet on the statues; but proceedings will, in all probability, never get that far. The fifth column activity of those unwilling to let foreign and non-union recording musicians make hay in fields that used to be theirs ought to do the trick.",en,books

"We provide a continually improving collection of questions and answers
Mike Lee, U.S. Senator from Utah
The Senate’s Advice and Consent role is grounded in the Constitution’s system of checks and balances. In Federalist 51, James Madison wrote that “the great security against a gradual concentration of the several powers in the same [branch of government], consists in giving to those who administer each [branch] the necessary constitutional means and personal motives to resist encroachments of the others.” Among those constitutional means is the Senate’s ability to withhold its consent for a nominee, forcing the president to work with Congress to address that body’s concerns.
In discussing the method for appointment of judicial and executive officers at the Philadelphia Convention in the summer of 1787, some believed the legislature alone should have the appointment power. Others would have vested that power entirely in the executive. The result, a compromise, was to authorize the president to nominate judges and executive officers, but only with the advice and consent of the Senate. This choice was, of course, deliberate. The Framers reasoned that “as the President was to nominate, there would be responsibility, and as the Senate was to concur, there would be security.” And they noted that it would not be wise “to grant so great a power to any single person,” as “[t]he people will think we are leaning too much towards Monarchy.” The Framers thus avoided, as Alexander Hamilton put it, the “several disadvantages which might attend [placing] the absolute power of appointment in the hands [of the president alone].”
The Framers also noted the general characteristics of the Senate that made it a proper body in which to vest the Advice and Consent role. James Madison considered placing the entire appointment power in the Senate, noting that its representatives are “sufficiently stable and independent to follow their deliberate judgments.” Similarly, in Federalist 76, Alexander Hamilton stated that requiring the cooperation of the Senate “would be an excellent check upon a spirit of favoritism in the President . . . [and] would be an efficacious source of stability in the administration.”
Because, at the time of the nation’s founding, Congress routinely recessed for six to nine months at a time, the Framers also authorized the president to “fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate.” As Alexander Hamilton explained in Federalist 67, the Framers allowed for recess appointments only because “it would have been improper to oblige [the Senate] to be continually in session for the appointment of officers.” But the Recess Appointments clause was meant “to be nothing more than a supplement [to the normal method of appointment],” which required the Senate’s advice and consent.
An important report from the Senate Judiciary Committee Report makes this same point. During a seconds-long intersession recess in 1903, President Theodore Roosevelt made over 160 recess appointments. In response, the Senate Judiciary Committee issued a report condemning the notion that the president can unilaterally make appointments during such a ‘constructive recess.” The Report explains that “[the Recess Appointments Clause] was carefully devised so as to accomplish the purpose in view [filling vacancies occurring while the Senate was in recess], without in the slightest degree changing the policy of the Constitution, that such appointments are only to be made with the participation of the Senate.” The Report further makes clear that, by providing for recess appointments, “[t]he framers of the Constitution were providing against a real danger to the public interest, not an imaginary one. They had in mind a period of time during which it would be harmful if an office were not filled; not a constructive, inferred, or imputed recess, as opposed to an actual one.”
In unilaterally making appointments to the CFPB and NLRB while the Senate was holding pro-forma sessions, President Obama has nonetheless attempted to fabricate a constructive, inferred, or imputed recess. Not only are President Obama’s January 4, 2012 appointments unconstitutional, but the justification for those actions does great violence to the Constitution’s separation of powers and system of checks and balances.
The key conclusion of the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel memorandum on which President Obama has relied is that the president may unilaterally conclude that the Senate’s “pro forma” sessions do not constitute sessions of the Senate for purposes of the Recess Appointments Clause. If allowed to stand, this deeply flawed assertion would upend an important element of the Constitution’s separation of powers. Under the procedures set forth in the Constitution, it is for the Senate, not the president, to determine when the Senate is in session. Indeed, the Constitution expressly grants the Senate power to “determine the Rules of its Proceedings.” Commenting on this provision in his authoritative constitutional treatise, Joseph Story noted that “[t]he humblest assembly of men is understood to possess [the power to make its own rules,] and it would be absurd to deprive the councils of the nation of a like authority.” And yet this is precisely the result of President Obama’s attempt to tell the Senate when it is in recess.
President Obama has thus encroached on the Senate’s prerogatives and violated the Constitution’s separation of powers. As the Supreme Court, has noted, the principle of separation of powers is “not simply an abstract generalization in the minds of the Framers: it [is a principle] woven into the document that they drafted in Philadelphia in the summer of 1787.” But that principle can mean little to the legislative branch if the executive branch is allowed to deprive the Senate of its constitutional right to make its own rules and determine for itself when it is in recess.
In justifying an improperly expansive reading of the executive’s authority under the Recess Appointments Clause, the OLC memorandum makes a number of mistakes, a few of which merit special mention.
First and foremost, the OLC memorandum employs an unsound interpretative methodology. Instead of engaging with the text, purpose, and original meaning of the Constitution’s Recess Appointments Clause, OLC’s memorandum engaged in a kind of “functional” analysis of the Constitution. Relying on a prior opinion rendered by Attorney General Harry Daugherty in 1921, OLC’s memorandum asserts that the Recess Appointments Clause must be given a “practical construction,” and that the “touchstone” for determining when the Senate is in session is “its practical effect: viz., whether or not the Senate is capable of exercising its constitutional function of advising and consenting to executive nominations.” The OLC memorandum thus ignores what Federalist 67 makes clear, namely that “[t]he ordinary power of appointment is confined to the President and Senate JOINTLY,” and the president’s power to appoint nominees absent Senate approval is but a small exception to that rule for cases in which a significant recess of the Senate requires a position “in the public service to [be] fill[ed] without delay.”
The OLC memorandum’s functionalist argument also fails on its own terms. During the Senate’s pro forma sessions, including its session on January 6, 2012, the Senate was manifestly capable of exercising its constitutional function of advice and consent. Notably, at one such pro forma session on December 23, 2011, the Senate passed a significant piece of legislation—the payroll tax cut extension, demonstrating that it is capable of conducting business at such sessions.",en,academic

"McLouth makes impact with homer, leaping grab
Running into wall, O's left fielder starts key double play to end Yanks' threat
NEW YORK -- Hot for more than a month, Nate McLouth saw red for an entire inning Thursday night.
Leading off the fifth, the Orioles left fielder drilled a fastball out to right at Yankee Stadium. Then, in the bottom of the inning, he made a leaping catch at the wall as he crashed into an electronic red sign he said was blindingly bright. That saved a run and started an inning-ending double play.
""I mean, it almost blinded me,"" McLouth said of the State Farm sign.
Before the O's took Game 4 of the American League Division Series, 2-1, over the Yankees in 13 innings, McLouth's homer was Baltimore's only run for 12 innings.
The O's leadoff man has been their best hitter this series, and he homered on a 1-2 pitch from Yanks starter Phil Hughes that got too much of the plate. That put Baltimore up, 1-0, and came after McLouth had walked and doubled in his first two plate appearances.
""It was obviously a mistake,"" said McLouth, who's hitting .333 (6-for-18) with two runs scored and three RBIs in the series. ""I think [Hughes] was trying to come in and didn't get it there. But you know, to get us on the board there, to get a lead there, it was the fifth inning, it was nice. I put a pretty good swing on it.""
McLouth has hits in all four games of the series, coming off his hottest month of the season, September, when he posted a .298/.372/.491 line. At an opportune time like this, he said he's feeling as good as he has all year.
""I really do,"" McLouth said. ""It's funny, when you feel good, and you get good pitches, you don't miss 'em. When you're struggling, you'll foul those pitches back. I just, yeah, I've been able to slow things down at the plate, and I think that's kind of what any hitter will tell you when they're feeling pretty good. They're able to stay under control.""
The catch in the bottom of the inning was remarkable in itself. The 7-6-3 double play he started with a relay to J.J. Hardy made it that much sweeter.
The Yankees had a runner on first base with one out, and Jayson Nix, starting at shortstop in place of Derek Jeter, hit a deep drive to left. McLouth raced back to the left-field wall, leapt and came up with it as his left side hit against the sign. His jump was well-timed, so he didn't hit the wall with overwhelming force.
""That's that deep part out there,"" McLouth said. ""I went back, I knew it was going to be close to the wall. And I took my eye off the ball for a second and it was kind of weird, because when I took my off the ball, I looked right into -- there's like a bright red State Farm [sign] out there -- and I mean it almost blinded me. Because I wanted to check where the wall was, but I just happened to look right at that bright sign, and it kind of threw me off for a second. But I was able to pick up the ball again when I looked back.""
Essentially, McLouth preserved the shutdown inning, and all the momentum he himself had created with the home run.
From his vantage point, catcher Matt Wieters wasn't sure McLouth had a chance at the ball, but he wasn't surprised by the play. To Wieters, the O's have two center fielders: one playing that position, Adam Jones, and the other playing left, McLouth.
""I didn't know he had it, but I knew if he had a chance, Nate was going to come down with the ball,"" Wieters said. ""He ran a long way for that ball, and was able to get it and make a good throw to J.J. to get a double play. That was a huge out in the game, and something that gave us a little bit of relief, to get back in the dugout with the lead.""",en,web
"In January 2006, the Ruakaka residents and ratepayers association called a meeting with the aim of bringing major industry leaders, developers and community representatives together, to ensure Ruakaka and its growth gained a mutual understanding by all as to the infrastructure and amenity requirements of the district as opposed to ad hoc development.
The Ruakaka Community Partnership was subsequently formed and for three years many valuable and successful discussions took place. Of these, the One Tree Point Foreshore Protection, Wastewater Disposal, and the Rail were some.

"Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (June 20, 2012) – Today, the U.S. public and private sectors announced that they are dedicating over half a billion dollars to address key water challenges around the world through the newly formed U.S. Water Partnership (USWP). U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lisa Jackson and former U.S. EPA Administrator William K. Reilly keynoted the global launch of the partnership, one of six signature initiatives announced by the U.S. government at the UN Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio + 20).
A joint effort of both public and private sectors in the U.S., the U.S. Water Partnership is supported by 41 members including government agencies, academic organizations, water coalitions, NGOs and the private sector. The partnership was first announced on March 22, 2012 by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton.
“I am proud to announce that the American people are doing our part by coming together through the U.S. Water Partnership, a public-private partnership that is pooling resources and mobilizing American expertise, knowledge, and ingenuity to address water challenges around the globe, especially in developing countries where needs are the greatest,” said U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton.
To support water security around the world, the USWP provides access to knowledge, technical assistance and training and partnership development services. The Global Environment & Technology Foundation is serving as the USWP’s secretariat.
“The U.S. Water Partnership will allow us to bring together the best thinking – in both the private and public sectors – to tackle the pressing water challenges the world faces today and will face in the future. Sharing American knowledge and expertise in water protection will allow us to mobilize resources and bring about real progress in the United States and abroad,” said EPA Administrator Lisa P. Jackson. “Like all of our sustainability work, this effort is about protecting health and the environment at the same time that we strengthen our economy. The 2 cross-sector partnerships that emerge will also allow us to rapidly scale-up innovative solutions so they can be deployed in places all over the globe – especially in the developing world, where water needs are greatest.”
Highlights of the contributions made by partners include:
- The Coca-Cola Company pledged $3.5 million to support sustainable safe water access in five African countries as well as support for operations of the U.S. Water Partnership.
- World Vision will dedicate $400 million in project support toward the goals of the partnership, including best practices from Water, Sanitation and Hygiene interventions in Haiti, India and West Africa and support for the USWP.
- Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) intends to invest at least $150 million within the next one to two years in critical water issues including desalination and distribution infrastructure.
- National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) will invest $21 million over the next five years on research and application activities that contribute to the understanding and improved management of our global water resources.
- The Nature Conservancy (TNC) is investing $30 million over the next five years to advance integrated water resource management, including Securing Water for People and Nature and the Great Rivers Partnership.
- The Rockefeller Foundation – The Foundation will support a $100,000 USWP signature initiative on “Multiple Use Services.”
- Skoll Global Threats Fund is investing $100,000 in a USWP signature initiative on water security in South Asia.
- U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will provide access to its watershed management tools, its water quality standards, and regulatory and policy support.
- World Resources Institute (WRI) is offering access to Aqueduct – a global information platform and tool for helping private and public sector decision-makers understand water-related risks.
On Monday, June 18, 2012, 45 corporate chiefs attending Rio+20 pledged to make water security a strategic priority and called for decisive action by governments. 3 In a message to USWP launch participants, Secretary Clinton said, “If you represent a region or a country in need of cross-sector water solutions, please reach out to us as this partnership was formed primarily to serve your needs. If you are an American citizen or organization with water knowledge and resources to share, I invite you to join the effort.”",en,reference

"Question Details:Our landlord just presented us with a lease renewal and he changed one major provision, that the maintenance of the furnace is now our responsibility and that we are required to purchase a service contract with his oil provider. I called the oil provider and the annual fee is $249.
Under the laws of all states in this country, if a landlord wants to place a provision in the written lease agreement such as the tenant being responsible for paying the annual service contract on the rented unit's furnace and the tenants sign the agreement, such provision is legally binding upon all parties to the lease.
There is nothing illegal about such a provision. If you do not want to sign the agreement with the provision, the landlord cannot force you to do so. But if you do not sign the lease as written, the landord may lease the rental to some other person who will sign the lease with the annual service contract provision in it.",en,reference
"In a basic Arduino sketch, if you want to take action based on the status of a digital input pin, you’d check the state of the pin repeatedly until a particular condition is met. However, as your sketches become increasingly complex, you’ll find that it’s not always the best way to do this. EngBlaze posted a pair of guides to using interrupts so that you can execute code asynchronously in Arduino sketch. Here’s the analogy they use to illustrate the difference:
Imagine you’re sitting on your couch, enjoying a frosty brew and watching a movie after a long day. Life is good. There’s only one problem: you’re waiting for an incredibly important package to arrive, and you need it as soon as possible. If you were a normal AVR program or Arduino sketch, you’d have to repeatedly stop your movie, get up, and go check the mailbox every 5 minutes to make sure you knew when the package was there.
Instead, imagine if the package was sent Fedex or UPS with delivery confirmation. Now, the delivery man will go to your front door and ring the doorbell as soon as he arrives. That’s your interrupt trigger. Once you get the trigger, you can pause your movie and go deal with the package. That’s your interrupt service routine. As soon as you’re done, you can pick up the film where you left off, with no extra time wasted. That’s the power of interrupts.
The first guide covers using hardware interrupts, such as switches and the second discusses timer interrupts, so that you don’t have to repeatedly check if a certain amount of time has passed when executing code on a particular interval. The guides are complete with code examples to give you a jumpstart on your own interrupt-driven Arduino project. [via Reddit]",en,code

Gauguin: Maker of Myth
February 27–June 5, 2011
Gauguin (1848–1903) was one of the most traveled artists in history, and it showed up in his work. His colorful images of Brittany and the islands of the South Seas are some of the most striking, distinct works of the last 200 years. His travels will be on display in nearly 120 works by Gauguin in the first major look at the artist's oeuvre in the United States since the NGA’s retrospective of the artist in 1988–1989. The exhibition, organized by Tate Modern, London, brings together an eclectic breadth of self-portraits, genre pictures, still lifes, and landscapes from throughout the artist's career. It includes not only oil paintings but also pastels, prints, drawings, sculpture, and decorated functional objects.
Venice: Canaletto and His Rivals
February 20–May 30, 2011
Venice inspired a school of competitive painters, who focused on the land, sea and cityscapes of the Bride of the Sea, resulting in a remarkable achievement in 18th-century art. This exhibition celebrates the rich variety of these Venetian views, known as vedute, through some 20 masterworks by Canaletto and more than 30 by his rivals. The painters depicted the famous monuments and vistas of Venice in different moods and seasons.
In the Tower: Nam June Paik
March 13 – October 2
Paik (1932–2006) is a towering figure in contemporary art. Born in Korea and trained in Japan and Germany in aesthetics and music, Paik settled in New York in 1964 and quickly became a pioneer in the integration of art with technology and performance. Considered by many to be the first video artist, this exhibition features a selection from Paik's estate as well as from the Gallery's own collection. The centerpiece is One Candle, Candle Projection (1988–2000), one of the artist's simplest, most dynamic works. Each morning a candle is lit and a video camera follows its progress, casting its flickering, magnified, processed image onto the walls in myriad projections.
Gabriel Metsu 1629–1667
April 17–July 24, 2011
One of the most important Dutch genre painters of the mid-17th century, Gabriel Metsu (1629–1667) could capture ordinary moments of life with freshness and spontaneity. Although his career was relatively short, Metsu enjoyed great success as a genre painter, but also for his religious scenes, still lifes, and portraits. The show will feature some 35 paintings by the artist.",en,reference

"The Infiniti G37 convertible.
The Infiniti G37 coupe and convertible performance models are the next boost...
... to the prestige brand’s presence.
The luxury arm of Nissan is the latest entrant in Australia, launching in September with the FX range of SUVs and the M sedans.
A G37 coupe and convertible will join the fleet later this month with prices starting at $75,900 for the V6-powered coupe and $87,900 for the hardtop. Infiniti Cars Australia general manager, Kevin Snell, says the duo deliver on the company’s “inspired performance” motto.
“The Infiniti G Coupe and Convertible are exciting alternatives to the current crop of luxury sports cars. Their exterior designs set them apart and they deliver a true sports car-style driving experience,” he notes. Both cars are propelled by a 3.7-litre V6 with 235kW/360Nm matched to a seven-speed automatic.
Standard equipment includes 18-inch alloy wheels, bi-xenon headlamps, dual-zone climate-control, leather upholstery, powered and heated front seats, a seven-inch touchscreen for the infotainment system, satnav, Bluetooth streaming, a Bose sound systems and a sunroof
The range-topping S premium versions add more interior bling along with upgraded brakes fitted inside 19-inch rims with a tyre pressure monitoring system. The coupe’s sports credentials are boosted by four-wheel steering, a sports suspension tune and a limited-slip differential.
The G37 will take on products from Japanese rival Lexus along with the usual German suspects in Audi, BMW and Mercedes-Benz, all of which have less powerful engines for the same price. Infiniti says its design gives buyers a chance to stand out from the angular pack without sacrificing comfort or performance. It also has the best warranty of any prestige brand at four years/100,000km.
“These two cars open Infiniti to another vital segment within the Australian luxury car market and expand the scope of our ability to offer luxury car buyers a long-awaited new choice,” Snell says.

"Whether they want to be or not, celebrities are always in competition with one another for the best film roles or maybe the top of the music charts. Regardless of how famous you get or how much money is in your bank account, it seems like nothing flaunts your status quite as well as owning your very own private island. Some famous names buy an island with plans to turn it into a luxury resort, while others merely want a quiet place they can relax with their family and friends without having to worry about their photo being taken. Owning your own island may seem crazy to some, but to those who have the money to spare, it's not all that crazy...especially if they have their own private plane to take them there.
Here are some of our favorite celebrity islands, past and present, from Johnny Depp's island retreat in the Bahamas to late Marlon Brando's French Polynesian haven.

Depp's island, Little Hall's Pond Cay, can be found in the Bahamas and is a tribute to some of the most important people in his life, with each beach dedicated to someone specific. For example, ""Gonzo"" beach is named for his friend, the legendary Hunter S. Thompson, while other beaches are named ""Paradis,"" ""Lily Rose,"" ""Jack,"" (after his previous partner and their kids) and ""Brando"" (after his mentor, actor Marlon Brando). He's also named a favorite snorkeling spot ""Heath's Place,"" in honor of the late Heath Ledger. The reclusive actor reportedly bought the island in 2004 for $3.6 million to find privacy for himself and his family, and keeps it as exclusive as possible. He also reportedly announced that the island is run solely on eco-friendly solar power.
In a 2009 interview with Vanity Fair, Depp said about his island, ""I don’t think I’d ever seen any place so pure and beautiful. You can feel your pulse rate drop about 20 beats. It’s instant freedom.”

Gibson reportedly bought Mago Island, which measures at around 5,400 acres, in Fiji for anywhere from $9 to $15 million (depending on what source you're reading) back in 2005. The Daily Beast reported that Gibson had plans to keep the island relatively untouched, save for a home he was planning on building, meaning that he gained many environmentalist fans. Apparently, it's one of the largest privately-owned islands in the South Pacific and considering it's basically the size of a small country, I'm not surprised.

Talented actor, and adamant advocate for environmentally friendly living, Leonardo DiCaprio bought his very own Belizean island, named Blackadore Caye, back in 2005 for a reported $1.7 million. Spanning 104 acres, this island is set right between the mainland of Belize and Ambergris Caye, meaning that he has the famed Barrier Reef nearby. Years ago DiCaprio announced his plans to build an eco-friendly resort and make his island public, but we have yet to see anything concrete in terms of development.

This famous magician owns Musha Cay, which is part of an archipelago, near the Bahamas, and is apparently longer than 100 miles. Years ago Copperfield allegedly claimed to have found the fountain of youth on his island, with many publications reporting that he told them he was able to watch dry leaves and small dead animals come back to life in front of his very eyes. I'm not sure about his claims but if it's true, there are certainly some people out there (Salma Hayek and Jennifer Aniston) that may be bathing in those waters monthly. If you're dying to find out for yourself, you can spend a week at the private island resort where Copperfield charges around $37,500 a day, with a four night minimum and a maximum of 24 guests allowed to stay at any one time.

Brando was one of the first big celebrities to buy himself an island back in 1965 and even helped buddy Johnny Depp out when Depp was hunting for his own. Brando's Tetiaroa haven, found in the South Pacific, was actually more than a simple island, it was a series of land masses that made up an entire atoll, spanning around 2.23 square miles across 13 islands. The actor apparently fell in love with the tropical beauty of the land back when he was filming Mutiny of the Bounty and lived on one of the islands right up until his health began failing in 1990. Purchased by Pacific Beachcomber, the islands are all set to be made into The Brando Hotel, which will feature 35 private villas and six-star facilities.

While most of the celebrities on this list favor tropical islands that really showcase their status, Celine Dion's island is surprisingly modest...all things considered, of course. Located in her home province of Quebec, this island is set in the Mille Îles River. While the location is pretty low-key, the mansion built on it is a testament to her diva-status. While tourists aren't welcome on the island itself, you can sneak a peek of Île Gagnon while on board a boat tour.

Faith Hill and Tim McGraw
As country music's biggest power couple, Faith Hill and Tim McGraw needed a private place to call their own, which is why they bought their own island in the Bahamas. Their island is found in Exumas, which is filled with luxury resorts, cute towns, and other retreats owned by people like Oprah Winfrey. This stretch of land is apparently fully developed and features many different hiking and horseback riding trails, as well as plenty of sunny beaches.

It's pretty tough to reach a higher status than the late John Lennon. The Beatles member bought his very own island in the late 1960s, which happened to be the craziest height of his life making a private island pretty necessary to get away from it all. Found in Ireland's Clew Bay, Dorninish island was purchased for only ?1,700 (around $2,737) and features 19 acres, originally meant to be his holiday vacation spot. When the island wasn't used as intended, it ended up being taken over by a group of 25 hippies, against the local residents' wishes, and became the group's campground for two years. Lennon reportedly had plans to retire to the island prior to his untimely assassination in 1980. The island can easily be seen from the mainland and stands as a must-visit spot in Ireland for any true Beatles fan.

"These wise words from Tolstoy seem even more relevant 100 years on.
Matt Ridley has published a great essay in WIRED SCIENCE today. Ridley nails an issue that has plagued humanity since time immemorial. Some supposedly intelligent human beings become so convinced that Doomsday is upon them that nothing will persuade them to the contrary. Ridley’s essay is a must read for everyone interested in Doomsday predictions that have failed to materialise and why we should dump the Climate Scare in the same basket.
When the sun rises on December 22, as it surely will, do not expect apologies or even a rethink. No matter how often apocalyptic predictions fail to come true, another one soon arrives. And the prophets of apocalypse always draw a following—from the 100,000 Millerites who took to the hills in 1843, awaiting the end of the world, to the thousands who believed in Harold Camping, the Christian radio broadcaster who forecast the final rapture in both 1994 and 2011.
Religious zealots hardly have a monopoly on apocalyptic thinking. Consider some of the environmental cataclysms that so many experts promised were inevitable. Best-selling economist Robert Heilbroner in 1974: “The outlook for man, I believe, is painful, difficult, perhaps desperate, and the hope that can be held out for his future prospects seem to be very slim indeed.” Or best-selling ecologist Paul Ehrlich in 1968: “The battle to feed all of humanity is over. In the 1970s [""and 1980s"" was added in a later edition] the world will undergo famines—hundreds of millions of people are going to starve to death in spite of any crash programs embarked on now … nothing can prevent a substantial increase in the world death rate.” Or Jimmy Carter in a televised speech in 1977: “We could use up all of the proven reserves of oil in the entire world by the end of the next decade.”
Predictions of global famine and the end of oil in the 1970s proved just as wrong as end-of-the-world forecasts from millennialist priests. Yet there is no sign that experts are becoming more cautious about apocalyptic promises. If anything, the rhetoric has ramped up in recent years. Echoing the Mayan calendar folk, theBulletin of the Atomic Scientists moved its Doomsday Clock one minute closer to midnight at the start of 2012, commenting: “The global community may be near a point of no return in efforts to prevent catastrophe from changes in Earth’s atmosphere.”
APOCOHOLISM IS GROWING
Over the five decades since the success of Rachel Carson’s Silent Spring in 1962 and the four decades since the success of the Club of Rome’s The Limits to Growth in 1972, prophecies of doom on a colossal scale have become routine. Indeed, we seem to crave ever-more-frightening predictions—we are now, in writer Gary Alexander’s word, apocaholic. The past half century has brought us warnings of population explosions, global famines, plagues, water wars, oil exhaustion, mineral shortages, falling sperm counts, thinning ozone, acidifying rain, nuclear winters, Y2K bugs, mad cow epidemics, killer bees, sex-change fish, cell-phone-induced brain-cancer epidemics, and climate catastrophes.
So far all of these specters have turned out to be exaggerated. True, we have encountered obstacles, public-health emergencies, and even mass tragedies. But the promised Armageddons—the thresholds that cannot be uncrossed, the tipping points that cannot be untipped, the existential threats to Life as We Know It—have consistently failed to materialize. To see the full depth of our apocaholism, and to understand why we keep getting it so wrong, we need to consult the past 50 years of history.
Ridley takes the reader through a modern day analogy of the four horsemen of the apocalypse.
The classic apocalypse has four horsemen, and our modern version follows that pattern, with the four riders being chemicals (DDT, CFCs, acid rain), diseases (bird flu, swine flu, SARS, AIDS, Ebola, mad cow disease), people (population, famine), and resources (oil, metals).

"Rafael Correa said he was ready to confront international lenders
Ecuador is to default officially on billions of dollars of foreign debt it considers ""illegitimate"", says President Rafael Correa.
Mr Correa said he had given the order not to approve a debt interest payment due on Monday, describing the international lenders as ""monsters"".
The president said that some of Ecuador's $10bn debt was contracted illegally by a previous administration.
It is the first debt default by a country in Latin America since 2001.
At that time, Argentina failed to repay debt in the midst of its financial meltdown.
Speaking in the city of Guayaquil, Mr Correa said ""as president I couldn't allow us to keep paying a debt that was obviously immoral and illegitimate"", according to the AFP news agency.
""We'll present a proposal to restructure the debt in order to resolve this problem as fast as possible,"" added the US-trained economist and ally of left-wing Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez.
His decision follows a government audit in November which recommended that Ecuador default on almost 40% of the $10bn foreign debt, accusing former officials and bankers of profiting irresponsibly from bond deals.
The country's foreign debt amounts to about a fifth of its Gross Domestic Product, or GDP.
In the past, Mr Correa has vowed to put money he has earmarked for spending on public programmes - ahead of paying foreign debt.
Correspondents say Ecuador's decision to effectively cut itself off from outside financing could lead to a budget shortfall, especially if the price of oil - the country's main revenue earner - continues to fall.
Oil is Ecuador's main source of income and accounts for 40% of the national budget.",en,web
"The Israel Koschitzky Virtual Beit Midrash
Surf A Little Torah
Yeshivat Har Etzion
By Rav David Silverberg
Among the more bizarre passages in the Talmud is the story told in Masekhet Megila (7b) of Rava and Rabbi Zeira, who each year would eat the Purim meal together, until one year, during the festivities, Rava became inebriated and ""slaughtered"" Rabbi Zeira. The following day, Rava prayed and the Almighty brought his colleague back to life.
How are we to understand this story? Could it be that Rava became so intoxicated that he murdered a fellow Jew, let alone a distinguished Talmud scholar?
The Maharsha explains that Rava urged Rabbi Zeira to drink during the Purim festivities, to the point where Rabbi Zeira took seriously ill. Rava then prayed on his colleague's behalf and Rabbi Zeira recovered from his intoxication. According to this reading, the Gemara relates this story in order to emphasize the dangers of excessive drinking, and warns against encouraging others to drink beyond their tolerance levels.
Rav Yaakov Emden explains differently, claiming that Rava pretended to kill Rabbi Zeira in order to restore a degree of solemnity to what had become a scene of frivolous merrymaking, rather than a true expression of gratitude to God. Rav Yaakov Emden refers us in this context to the famous stories told in Masekhet Berakhot (30b-31a) of wedding celebrations that became excessively frivolous, prompting rabbis to take drastic measures such as breaking an expensive glass to restore a sense of solemnity. Similarly, Rava sought to bring a halt to the silly merriment by staging a murder. Rabbi Zeira, who was unaware of Rava's intentions, was terror-stricken and fainted. Rava thus had to pray for Rabbi Zeira's recovery, which the Gemara describes as his revival from death. According to Rav Yaakov Emden's reading, the Gemara here seeks to emphasize the importance of maintaining a degree of solemnity even during the Purim celebrations, rather than allow the festivities to degenerate into sheer silliness.
Hutner, in his Pachad Yitzchak (Purim, 32), suggests interpreting the
Gemara's reference to Rabbi Zeira's ""death"" as a metaphoric description of the
transformational experience he underwent over the course of his Purim
observance. Chazal famously
describe Purim as a day of kabbalat ha-Torah, when we celebrate the
Jewish people's reacceptance of the Torah even under the trying conditions of
exile. As part of our celebration
of this festival, we, too, are enjoined to reaffirm our unwavering commitment to
the study and observance of Torah; the Purim festivities celebrate not only our
nation's rescue from Haman, but also our spiritual renewal. This experience of kabbalat
ha-Torah, Rav Hutner explained, entails a process of internal
transformation. Thus, for example,
Chazal comment that when Benei Yisrael accepted the Torah at
Rav Yitzchak Blau (""The Wildness of Purim,"" http://vbm-torah.org/purim/pur66-yb.htm) added an insightful observation concerning the implications of this story's conclusion in light of Rav Hutner's understanding. The Gemara concludes that the following year, Rabbi Zeira chose to discontinue the practice of joining Rava for the Purim feast, unwilling to have to again rely on supernatural divine intervention. If, as Rav Hutner explains, Rabbi Zeira did not actually ""die,"" but rather underwent a powerful transformation of self as a result of reaffirming his commitment to Torah, why did he fear repeating this experience? Rav Blau suggested that this perhaps reflects the instinctive fear that people have of substantive change and transformation. People grow accustomed to their current selves and the ""fear of the unknown"" often prevents them from welcoming meaningful change in their lives, even changes that can profoundly enhance their characters and conduct.
We might add yet another dimension of Rav Hutner's understanding of this episode. If, indeed, the Gemara refers to Rabbi Zeira's internal transformation, why does it attribute this experience to Rava ""Rava arose and slaughtered Rabbi Zeira""? Why is Rava described as having brought this experience upon Rabbi Zeira?
Perhaps, the Gemara seeks to emphasize the profound influence that peers and colleagues can exert upon one another. Rabbi Zeira could not have achieved this watershed spiritual experience alone; it was Rava's company and influence that inspired Rabbi Zeira to this level of kabbalat ha-Torah. If so, then this Gemara becomes a powerful statement regarding the importance of dibbuk chaveirim, the extent to which friends and colleagues can inspire and impact upon each another.
The Malbim, in his commentary to Megilat Ester, presents a novel
and intriguing approach to understanding the techniques and schemes employed by
Haman in securing Achashverosh's approval for his plan to destroy the Jews of
Persia. While it is commonly
understood that Haman won Achashverosh's wholehearted support for his cruel
edict, the Malbim interprets the verses to mean that Haman actually had to
deceive the king in order to execute his plan. Otherwise, the Malbim contends,
Achashverosh would not possibly have agreed to the elimination of such a large
group of people in his kingdom, certainly not the Jews, who had achieved in
For one thing, the Malbim notes, Haman does not identify the name of the
group of people he seeks to eliminate, referring to them instead as ""one nation,
scattered and dispersed among the peoples
"" (3:8). He proceeds to emphasize this group's
allegiance only to their own rules and principles, and not to the mores and laws
Of course, in the actual sefarim scrolls that Haman dispatched throughout the kingdom, he clearly called for in the name of the king killing all the empire's Jews (see 3:13). However, as the Megila tells (3:12), these scrolls were ""sealed with the king's seal."" While this clause is generally interpreted to mean that the scrolls bore the royal seal as proof of authenticity, the Malbim claims that the scrolls arrived sealed to each locale with strict orders that they not be opened until the thirteenth of Adar. In this vein, the Malbim understands the verse that tells of the writ being ""revealed to all the peoples"" and the announcement that the kingdom ""be prepared"" for the day of the thirteenth of Adar (3:14). The content of the scrolls, which recorded the king's order to kill all the Jews in the empire, was to be revealed only on the day when this was to be executed. All that the people were told in the interim was that they must be prepared for warfare come the thirteenth of Adar. Haman thereby ensured that the Jews would have no possibility of preparing themselves for this day, either by lobbying government officials or by mobilizing a paramilitary.
According to the Malbim, then, Haman's edict to kill the Jewish
What foiled Haman's plan, the Malbim writes, was Mordekhai's discovery of the plot. This explains the otherwise peculiar phrase, ""And Mordekhai knew of everything that was happening"" (4:1), which suggests that we might have otherwise presumed that he had not learned of Haman's plan. The Malbim chooses not to speculate as to how precisely Mordekhai gained access to this confidential information, commenting instead that Divine Providence saw to it that Mordekhai would discover the plan so he could summon Ester to work against it.
The Malbim's approach accentuates one of the primary themes of Purim, that of ""utzu eitza ve-tufar"" (Mishlei 3:25), God's ability to foil even the most sophisticated and carefully-designed plan. Regardless of what kind of schemes Am Yisrael's foes design in planning for our destruction, it is well within the Almighty's power to disrupt their plans and ensure our survival.
The Torah in Parashat Ki-Tisa restates the mitzva of aliya le-regel, requiring all males from Benei Yisrael to frequent the Beit Ha-mikdash during the three festivals of Pesach, Shavuot and Sukkot (34:23). This mitzva had been mentioned earlier, in Parashat Mishpatim (23:17), but here, in Parashat Ki-Tisa, the Torah adds an accompanying guarantee that Benei Yisrael's properties would remain secure even when all the men are away in Jerusalem: ""No man shall covet your land when you go to be seen by the Lord your God three times a year"" (34:24).
The Gemara (Pesachim 8b) derives from this verse that the obligation of aliya le-regel applies only to those who own property; men who own no land or houses are not required to make the tri-yearly pilgrimage.
Rav Yissachar Frand observed that this halakha might affect our understanding of the
reason behind the mitzva of aliya le-regel. Instinctively, we might assume that the
pilgrimage is intended to ensure regular pilgrimages to the
In light of the condition of land ownership, however, a more specific purpose may be attributed to this mitzva: to remind the landowner of the One who truly owns his land, that he lives on his property only through the grace and kindness of the Almighty. The Torah requires one to leave his property to come and pray and bring offerings to God in the Beit Ha-mikdash, to impress upon him that the Almighty is the true owner over the entire earth. This obligation requires one to trust in God's ability to protect his land during his absence, further emphasizing His unlimited power and control over the entire earth. Indeed, as noted by Seforno (23:17), both here and in Parashat Mishpatim the Torah refers to God in this context with the term Adon (""Master""), a term rarely used in reference to the Almighty. Seforno explains Adon as referring specifically to God's authority over the earth, thus reinforcing the notion that this mitzva serves as a reminder of God's ownership over all property on earth.
It should be noted that both here and in Parashat Mishpatim, the section that mentions this mitzva includes as well the obligation of bikkurim bringing one's first fruits to the Mikdash (23:19, 34:26). This mitzva, too, serves as an expression of God's ownership over the land; the farmer brings his fruits to God just as a sharecropper transfers a percentage of his crop to the field's owner. Similarly, the parallel section in Parashat Mishpatim includes the mitzva to desist from agricultural activity during the shemita year (23:11), an obligation that is intended at least in part to remind the farmer of his limited control and authority of his land.
Thus, aliya le-regel, too, serves to remind Benei Yisrael that it is God, and not they, who enjoys full ownership and control over the land in which they settle. Three times each year, Benei Yisrael leave their homes and fields to give honor to God in the Beit Ha-mikdash, trusting in his promise and ability to protect their properties from intruders.
In the wake of the sin of the golden calf and Moshe's appeals to God on Benei Yisrael's behalf, God declares to Moshe the ""shelosh esrei midot rachamim,"" the thirteen ""attributes of mercy"" which establish the possibility of earning forgiveness for sin. This declaration allows for the covenant between God and Am Yisrael to continue even should Benei Yisrael break their side of the agreement; the divine attributes of mercy delineated in this list guarantee the nation the possibility of repairing its relationship with God through the process of teshuva.
The thirteen attributes begin with ""Hashem, Hashem,"" the double mention of God's Name. As Rashi cites from the Gemara (Masekhet Rosh Hashanah 17b), ""Hashem, Hashem"" constitutes one of the thirteen attributes, and should be understood to mean, ""I am Him before a person sins, and I am Him after a person sins and repents."" God declares His preparedness to relate to a person in precisely the same fashion after he transgresses as He had prior to the misdeed. In interpersonal relationships, it often happens that even after an apology and granting of forgiveness, a certain tension remains between the two parties that prevents them from fully restoring their relationship to where it had been before the wrong was committed. God therefore guarantees that sincere teshuva can bring a sinner's relationship with the Almighty to precisely the same point where it had been previously.
Rav Shraga Pollak, in his work Tishbi (
The Ramban, in his commentary to Parashat Ki-Tisa (32:1), advances his
famous theory claiming that the sin of the golden calf did not constitute
idolatry. According to the Ramban,
Benei Yisrael fashioned the calf not as a substitute for the Almighty,
but rather as a substitute for Moshe.
This indeed seems to be the straightforward meaning of the request they
present to Aharon: ""Go and make for us an elohim that will lead us
[literally, 'that will go out before us'], for this man Moshe who took us from
The Ramban begins his discussion by citing Rashi's comments to this verse, and expressing his disapproval of Rashi's approach. Rashi wrote in his commentary, ""They desired many deities: 'for this man Moshe who took us from the land of Egypt' and would show us the way which we should travel 'we know not what has happened to him' and we therefore need many deities who will lead us'."" It appears from the Ramban's presentation that he understood Rashi's remarks to mean that Benei Yisrael indeed worshipped the calf as a deity, and did not merely seek a replacement for Moshe.
Rav Eliyahu Mizrachi explains that the Ramban arrived at this understanding of Rashi based on Rashi's comment, ""elohot harbei ivu lahem"" ""they desired many deities"" which seems to suggest that they were drawn to polytheistic worship. However, as Rav Eliyahu Mizrachi contends, the word elohot need not be understood to mean ""deities""; quite often this term is used in reference to human leadership and authority, particularly in the context of the judiciary. Accordingly, Rav Eliyahu Mizrachi argues that Rashi, too, did not view chet ha-egel as a sin of idolatry, and he in fact subscribed to the Ramban's view, that Benei Yisrael sought a substitute for Moshe. Indeed, Rashi explicitly describes the people bemoaning the perceived loss of Moshe who ""would show us the way which we should travel,"" seemingly indicating that it was Moshe, and not the Almighty, whom they found it necessary to replace.
The Taz, however, in his Divrei David, dismisses the approach taken by Rav Eliyahu Mizrachi, and claims that Rashi indeed understood chet ha-egel as a sin of outright idol worship. According to the Taz, the Ramban's reading of Rashi is based on Rashi's concluding remarks to this verse: ""and we therefore need many deities [elohot] who will lead us."" Rashi understood the people's comments to Aharon as emphasizing that in Moshe's absence, they require specifically elohot and not human beings to lead them. Moshe's presumed death did more than simply necessitate a substitute; it changed the people's perspective on their leadership needs. The sudden loss of Moshe made Benei Yisrael feel insecure being led by a mortal who can one day disappear. In their mind, they needed a leader that cannot die, in which they can confidently rely to bring them successfully to their destination. They were no longer interested in a human prophet who would instruct them in accordance with the will of an invisible God; they desired physical beings that would not perish and to which they could look as a secure source of success and protection.
According to the Taz's reading of Rashi, then, Benei Yisrael indeed sought to replace Moshe, but to replace him with a pagan deity, and they thus committed genuine idolatry through the fashioning and worship of the golden calf.
Parashat Ki-Tisa begins with the mitzva of machatzit
ha-shekel, the annual tax donated by each male of Benei Yisrael and
with which the national census was taken.
God commands Moshe that the amount required for this donation is ""a
half-shekel in the shekels of kodesh"" (""machatzit ha-shekel be-shekel
ha-kodesh"" 30:13). Rashi
explains this expression as simply intended to identify the currency to which
God refers. He speaks here of ""the
shekels of kodesh,"" the unit of currency that Benei Yisrael were
to use in making calculations relevant to the
The Ramban explains similarly, adding that it was Moshe himself who
established this unit of currency.
It was common for kings to designate a currency that would be identified
with their rule, and thus Moshe, who had the status of king of
Rav Moshe Feinstein (as cited in Kol Ram, vol. 3) suggested a homiletic explanation for the term shekel ha-kodesh, in accordance with the literal implication of the phrase ""the sacred shekel."" The Torah here seeks to convey the message that when a person donates money to important causes in this case, the Beit Ha-mikdash all his money assumes a ""sacred"" quality. Generous donations to meaningful causes reflect the recognition of the fact that all that one owns has been given to him by the Almighty to be used constructively. Thus, if a person is prepared to give his money to support the poor and religious institutions, his money becomes kodesh, property that has been designated for the sacred purpose of furthering the cause of Torah and mitzvot among the Jewish people.
Parashat Ki-Tisa begins with God's instruction to Moshe, ""When you count the Israelites according to their enrollment, each man shall give a ransom for himself to the Lord when they are counted"" (30:12). This verse establishes the obligation to conduct censuses by having each individual donate a ""ransom for his soul."" In the next verse, God commands, ""This is what they shall give, all who are included in the census: a half-shekel ""
The conventional reading of this pair of verses views the second verse as explaining the first. Meaning, it clarifies that the ""ransom"" given by each person included in the census was to be a half-shekel. Whenever a census was taken of Benei Yisrael, they were each required to donate a half-shekel by which the census was conducted.
The Vilna Gaon, however, as cited in Ha-ketav Ve-ha-kabbala, explained this pair of verses differently, as referring to two entirely separate contexts. The first verse establishes the obligation to count the nation by having each member donate a ""ransom for his soul."" The second verse, which calls for a mandatory half-shekel donation, speaks of an obligation that applied only at this point when Benei Yisrael constructed the Mishkan. After the completion of the Mishkan, Benei Yisrael were called upon to make this half-shekel donation towards the maintenance and operation of the Mishkan; this verse does not, however, introduce an eternal obligation of an annual half-shekel tax.
The Vilna Gaon's reading yields several ramifications. For one thing, it means that the obligation for Benei Yisrael to donate a ""ransom"" when a census is conducted does not require specifically the donation of a half-shekel towards the Beit Ha-mikdash. Indeed, the Ramban (30:15) already raises the question of why the monei ha-mitzvot, the Rishonim who listed the 613 commandments, did not list a prohibition against donating more or less than a half-shekel when a census is taken, as the Torah forbids here in Parashat Ki-Tisa (30:15). According to the Gaon, the answer is, quite simply, that this prohibition was issued only for that generation, with regard to the one-time contribution required after the Mishkan's construction. This did not establish a Torah obligation to donate precisely a half-shekel when a census is taken. Furthermore, it emerges from the Gaon's approach that the Torah never explicitly requires an annual half-shekel donation. The annual obligation of machatzit ha-shekel, the Vilna Gaon claimed, was taught through oral tradition, and was not established explicitly in the Torah. Finally, the Gaon disagrees in this regard with the classic commentators (such as Rashi and Ramban) who explained that God here commanded that a census be taken of Benei Yisrael before the construction of the Mishkan. In his view, as mentioned, the second verse of this pair ""This is what they shall give a half-shekel"" is not a continuation of the first verse which speaks of taking a census. Hence, when God ordered Benei Yisrael at this point to donate a half-shekel, it was not for the purpose of counting the nation, but rather simply to raise funds for the functioning of the Mishkan.
The Gaon's approach to this pair of verses may also involve a linguistic issue, as discussed by Ha-ketav Ve-ha-kabbala. The second verse begins with the word zeh, which, of course, is generally translated as ""this."" This verse is therefore normally translated as, ""This is what they shall give "" Ha-ketav Ve-ha-kabbala, however, contends that according to the Vilna Gaon, the word zeh here means ""now."" After introducing the law concerning the census, God tells Moshe that ""now,"" at this point, no census is required, but Benei Yisrael must contribute a half-shekel for a different purpose, namely, to support the operations in the Mishkan.",en,academic

"Gloucester Sheriff’s Office investigating apparent murder/suicide
The Gloucester Sheriff’s Office is investigating the apparent murder/suicide of a husband and wife. Deputies were called to 11369 George Washington Highway around 2:50 p.m. on Wednesday, Sept. 8, where they found the bodies of 51-year-old Robert Harper and his wife, 40-year-old Lisa Harper, according to GSO Chief Deputy Darrell Warren. He said both were victims of gunshot wounds.
Lisa Harper lived at the house with her two teenage children, Warren said, and her husband had been living in Mathews. He said the husband and wife had been separated for two to four weeks. Warren said it appeared the deaths were a result of a murder/suicide but a final determination was pending a report from the medical examiner.",en,web

"With the smell of jerk chicken in the air and drinks courtesy of Grey Goose and Bacardi being served, a press conference was held Wednesday evening with International Reggae Superstars Shaggy and Maxi Priest to discuss their upcoming show next week at Barclays Center on Wednesday, December 12, 2012. Shaggy and Maxi Priest will be joined by two more International Reggae Superstars on stage at Barclays Center, Beres Hammond and Ali Campbell’s UB40.
During the press conference, Maxi Priest was asked if he ever thought one of his biggest hits, “Close To You”, would do so well. His answer, in a single word, was “Never.” He didn’t expect the single to be as big of a worldwide hit as it was, but he was able to capitalize on it with other big hits.
Speaking of big hits, not too many in music, let alone reggae, have had the type of success that Shaggy has experienced. From “Oh Carolina” and “Boombastic” to “Angel” and “It Wasn’t Me”, Shaggy is the only certified Diamond-selling Dancehall Reggae artist of all time. Diamond certification equals 10 million records sold.
Shaggy discussed the strong West Indian, or Caribbean presence in Brooklyn, where Barclays Center is located, and the Brooklynite talked about the “opportunity to make our presence known” for the Caribbean community at the arena the night of the show.
With all of the success that the four artists performing next week have had, Shaggy pointed out that there is still no major station that has a reggae format. That means that stars in the genre have to produce what Shaggy called “undeniable hits” that will enable the songs to crossover. Fans will be treated to four artists who managed to accomplish that success time and time again.
There were rumors that Maxi Priest was supposed to replace Ali Campbell in the band UB40 when Campbell left. He addressed the rumors head on, saying “From the horse’s mouth, not that I am a horse, I am not UB41″ to laughter and cheers of the crowd.
Shaggy pointed out to those in attendance that this is a “quality show with quality performers” that will bring a “quality audience.” Indeed, this is a show with artists with numerous hits, who will be joined by other big artists on stage (as they both agreed would happen at the show) and all of those in attendance should be in for a treat at the very first reggae concert at Barclays Center.",en,web

The Hindenburgdamm Rail Causeway across the Wadden Sea to the island of Sylt in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany
|Ancestor||None. (See Ford (crossing))|
|Related||None. (See step-stone bridge)|
|Descendant||None. (See viaduct)|
|Material||Concrete, masonry, Earth-fill|
A causeway is a road or railway route across a broad body of water or wetland raised up on an embankment. Some causeways may only be usable at low tide and the distinction between causeways and viaducts can become blurred when flood-relief culverts are incorporated in the structure; a causeway is however primarily supported on earth or stone, whereas a bridge or viaduct is mainly supported by free-standing columns or arches.
When first used, the word appeared in a form such as “causey way” making clear its derivation from the earlier form “causey”. This word seems to have come from the same source by two different routes. It derives ultimately, from the Latin for heel, calx, and most likely comes from the trampling technique to consolidate earthworks. In Ancient times, the construction was trodden down, one layer at a time, often by slaves or flocks of sheep. Today, this work is done by machines. The same technique would have been used for road embankments, raised river banks, sea banks and fortification earthworks. (The layers, though not the trampling action, can be seen in the Bayeux Tapestry: Building Hastings Castle.)
The second derivation route is simply the hard, trodden surface of a path. The name by this route came to be applied to a firmly surfaced road. It is now little-used except in dialect and in the names of roads which were originally notable for their solidly made surface.
The word is comparable in both meanings with the French chaussée, from a form of which it reached English by way of Norman French. The French adjective, chaussée, carries the meaning of having been given a hardened surface, and is used to mean either paved or shod. As a noun chaussée is used on the one hand for a metalled carriageway, and on the other for an embankment with or without a road. Other languages have a noun with similar dual meaning. In Welsh, it is sarn. The Welsh is relevant here, as it also has a verb, sarnu, meaning to trample. The trampling and ramming technique for consolidating earthworks was used in fortifications and there is a comparable, outmoded form of wall construction technique, used in such work and known as pisé, a word derived not from trampling but from ramming or tamping.
The modern embankment may be constructed within a cofferdam: two parallel steel sheet pile or concrete retaining walls, anchored to each other with steel cables or rods. This construction may also serve as a dyke that keeps two bodies of water apart, such as bodies with a different water level on each side, or with salt water on one side and fresh water on the other. This may also be the primary purpose of a structure, the road providing a hardened crest for the dike, slowing erosion in the event of an overflow. It also provides access for maintenance as well perhaps, as a public service.
Notable causeways include those that connect Singapore and Malaysia (the Johor–Singapore Causeway), Bahrain and Saudi Arabia (25-km long King Fahd Causeway) and Venice to the mainland, all of which carry roadways and railways. In the Netherlands there are a number of prominent dykes which also double as causeways, including the Afsluitdijk, Brouwersdam, and Markerwaarddijk. In Louisiana, two very long bridges, called the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway, stretch across Lake Pontchartrain for almost 38 km, making them the world's longest bridges (if total length is considered instead of span length). They are also the oldest causeways on the Gulf Coast that have never been put out of commission for an extended period of time following a hurricane. In the Republic of Panama a causeway connects the islands of Perico, Flamenco, and Naos to Panama City on the mainland. It also serves as a breakwater for ships entering the Panama Canal. Its English name causeway is sometimes confused with ""Coastway"", name of a touristic zone in Panama city. The Aztec city-state of Tenochtitlan had causeways supporting roads and aqueducts. The oldest engineered road yet discovered is the Sweet Track in England, dating from the 3800s BC.
Causeways are also common in Florida, where low bridges may connect several man-made islands, often with a much higher bridge (or part of a single bridge) in the middle so that taller boats may pass underneath safely. Causeways are most often used to connect the barrier islands with the mainland.
The Churchill Barriers in Orkney are of the most notable sets of causeways in Europe. Constructed in waters up to 18 metres deep, the four barriers link five islands on the eastern side of the natural harbour at Scapa Flow. They were built during World War II as military defences for the harbour, on the orders of Winston Churchill.
The Estrada do Istmo connecting the islands of Taipa and Coloane in Macau was initially built as a causeway. The sea on both sides of the causeway had become shallower as a result of silting, and mangroves had conquer the area. Later on land reclamation took place on both sides of the road and the area has subsequently be named Cotai and become home of several casino complexes. In Okinawa, Japan, connected by the Mid-Sea Road are the Katsuren Peninsula, Henza Island, Miyagi Island, Ikei Island and Hamahiga-Island.
Specific causeways around the world 
|This section requires expansion. (April 2009)|
Various causeways in the world:
- Canso Causeway, Nova Scotia, Canada ( )
- Hindenburgdamm, Germany ( )
- Johor-Singapore Causeway ( )
- Lake Ponchartrain Causeway, Louisiana ( )
- King Fahd Causeway, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia ( )
- Venice ( )
- Mahim Causeway, Mumbai, India
- Swarkestone causeway, Derby, England, United Kingdom
- Causeway across Haraldssund, Faroe Islands
- Causeway across Hvannasund, Faroe Islands
- Rømødæmningen, Denmark, connecting Rømø (island) with the mainland across the wadden sea
- MacArthur Causeway, Florida, United States
Causeways affect currents and may therefore be involved in beach erosion or changed deposition patterns; this effect has been a problem at the Hindenburgdamm in northern Germany. During hurricane seasons, the winds and rains of approaching tropical storms--as well as waves generated by the storm in the surrounding bodies of water—make traversing causeways problematic at best and impossibly dangerous during the fiercest parts of the storms. For this reason (and related reasons, such as the need to minimize traffic jams on both the roads approaching the causeway and the causeway itself), emergency evacuation of island residents is a high priority for local, regional, and even national authorities.

"Great news for pilots: After at least 10 very slow years, the aviation industry is in a period of growth. Experts predict that we'll encounter a drastic pilot shortage in the coming years, which means that your dream job may not be as far away as you thought!
If you're looking for a flying job, here are a few links to check out:
If you're a low-time pilot, then US Pilot is a great site to start with. It is updated constantly with flight instruction, banner towing, aerial mapping, part 135 and corporate pilot jobs. Membership is free.
Popular among defense companies, AviationEmployment.com typically has a lot of job postings for test pilots and military veterans.
This widely-used website has been around since 1988, and according to their website, is the leading site for aviation and airline jobs. On Avjobs.com, you can learn about and search for pilot jobs, read articles, browse through tips and advice, search for an aviation school, subscribe to newsletters, and even get help with your resume. All of these services come with a charge, though. There are different payment plans for different services, with discounts for students and military members.
Aviation Week reaches over 185 countries, so their job board includes job openings from around the world. You'll see a variety of jobs here, but it's another hot spot for defense jobs and government contract jobs at places like Boeing, Northrup-Grumman, Sikorsky, and the military. There are a few corporate and flight instructor jobs openings listed here, as well.
The FAA hires pilots to create and inspect operations, both in the air and on the ground. Pilots for the FAA can inspect airways, test and identify problems with terminal and enroute procedures, etc. The FAA will surely be hiring more pilots to assist with the implementation of NextGen, so check out the FAA jobs website for updates.
Avianation.com is another job site that charges monthly or yearly fees to search and apply for jobs. The website boasts that they offer the most variety of job postings for low-time to high-time pilots. It's good for pilots looking for a global career, as well as cargo operations. The site does seem to incorporate information from a variety of sources. As with any site that charges, be careful you aren't paying for information you could be getting for free (such as job postings from the FAA and NTSB, which can always be found on the respective individual websites).
The monster of all job search sites, Monster.com is always a good place to look. It's a little light on the aviation jobs, especially flying jobs, and you might have to weed through the ads and irrelevant work-at-home jobs to find what you need. But Monster is a good tool for those of you that can relocate. There are a lot of postings for metropolitan areas, but you may notice that there are few listings for smaller cities and towns.
Similar to Monster.com, you may get lucky and find a few pilot postings here if you can get through the ads and unrelated postings. Be aware of the many pilot jobs for military careers (unless that's what you're looking for). The posts rarely disclose the military commitment required up front, and it can be a time-waster if you don't actually desire (or qualify for) a flying career in the military.",en,web
"Four local female senior varsity athletes were recognized as part of the 27th annual National Girls and Women in Sports Day last Friday. The girls, Pentucket’s Marissa Porter and Tori Spofford, and Newburyport’s Lea Tomasz and Casey Barlow were picked by their coaches and athletic directors as standout female athletes for their respective schools.
“I was really happy to be chosen,” said Porter, who co-captains the girls cross-country team for the Sachems, runs indoor track and plays lacrosse. “I was proud to be there. It was a really good experience to be with girls from all across the state who are athletes like you are. It was a good environment to be in.”
The event was held in Faneuil Hall and featured a pair of inspiring guest speakers. TD Garden president Amy Latimer was the keynote speaker, and former Rockford Peaches centerfielder and original member of the All-American Women’s Baseball League Mae Mordabito (who was played in the 1992 film, “A League of Their Own,” by Madonna) was a crowd favorite.
“We have so many more opportunities now,” said Spofford. “And they keep adding sports that girls can play. (Mordabito) only had baseball as an opportunity back then. And she’s still going. She’s amazing.”
Spofford, who co-captains the Pentucket field hockey, indoor track and lacrosse teams, says she was moved by the event and sees her opportunities as a female athlete in the 21st century as boundless, thanks to women like Mordabito.
“My friend, Sam Bomba, she’s the goalie on the hockey team,” said Spofford, who would love to try rugby some day. “And she’s starting varsity. I think that’s amazing too. I’d love to do something like that. I love the sports I play. I love the sports I chose. But I’d love to do everything.”
Latimer also stood out as a speaker.
“The keynote speaker was really good, she had an awesome story to tell,” Porter said of Latimer. “She talked about growing up playing sports and the opportunities she had then as opposed to all the opportunities we have now. She worked really hard to get where she is now. After listening to her, I felt really inspired.”
Tomasz, who plays field hockey, basketball and softball, represented the Clippers along with Barlow (cross-country, basketball, softball).
“There were a lot of different girls there,” said Tomasz. “There were over 200 girls from all over Massachusetts. It was cool to see all those other girls who play sports because usually sports are always based around boys. So it was interesting to see all the other girls there.”
Tomasz and Barlow were also joined in attendance by fellow Clipper female varsity athletes Kendra Dow (field hockey, hockey, softball) and Meri Adsit (cross-country, indoor track, lacrosse.)
“She talked about all the sports that go on (at the TD Garden),” Tomasz said of Latimer. “She went to the University of Rhode Island to play basketball, and she realized just how much she liked to be around sports, and how her sport has grown to be as vital as it is today.”
“It’s always nice to be chosen for something like that,” said Spofford, who hopes to play field hockey at Babson College next year. “It’s such an honor.”",en,web

"Belleau Wood, near Chateau Thierry, France, was the scene of a World War I battle, 6 June 1918.
(CV-24: dp. 11,000; l. 622'6""; b. 109'2""; dr. 26'; s. 31.6 k.; cpl. 1,569; a. 26 40mm.; cl. Independence)
New Haven (CL-76) was reclassified CV-24 and renamed Belleau Wood 16 February 1942. She became CVL-24 on 15 July 1943. Belleau Wood was launched 6 December 1942 by New York Shipbuilding Corp., Camden, N.J.; sponsored by Mrs. Thomas Holcomb, wife of the Commandant of the Marine Corps; and commissioned 31 March 1943, Captain A.M. Pride in command.
After a brief shakedown cruise Belleau Wood reported to the Pacific Fleet, arriving at Pearl Harbor 26 July 1943. After supporting the occupation of Baker Island (1 September) and taking part in the Tarawa (18 September) and Wake Island (5-6 October) raids, she joined TF 50 for the invasion of the Gilbert Islands (19 November-4 December 1943).
Belleau Wood operated with TF 58 during the seizure of Kwajalein and Majuro Atolls, Marshall Islands (29 January-3 February 1944), Truk raid (16-17 February); Saipan-Tinian-Rota-Guam raids (21-22 February); Palau-Yap-Ulithi-Woleai raid (30 March-1 April); Sawar and Wakde Island raids in support of the landings at Hollandia, New Guinea (22-24 April); Truk-Satawan-Ponape raid (29 April-1 May); occupation of Saipan (11-24 June), 1st Bonins raid (15-16 June), Battle of the Philippine Sea (19-20 June); and 2nd Bonins raid (24 June). During the Battle Of the Philippine Sea, Belleau Wood's planes sank the Japanese carrier Hiyo.
After an overhaul at Pearl Harbor (29 June-31 July 1944) Belleau Wood rejoined TF 58 for the last stages of the occupation of Guam (2-10 August). She joined TF 38 and took part in the strikes in support of the occupation of the southern Palaus (6 September-14 October); Philippine Islands raids (9-24 September); Morotai landings (15 September); Okinawa raid (10 October); northern Luzon and Formosa raids (11-14 October); Luzon strikes (15 and 17-19 October), and the Battle of Cape Engaño (24-26 October). On 30 October, while Belleau Wood was patrolling with her task group east of Leyte, she shot down a Japanese suicide plane which fell on her flight deck aft causing fires which set off ammunition. Before the holocaust could be brought under control 92 men were killed or missing.
After temporary repairs at Ulithi (2-11 November), Belleau Wood steamed to Hunter's Point, Calif., for permanent repairs and an overhaul, arriving 29 November. She departed San Francisco Bay 20 January 1945 and joined TF 58 at Ulithi on 7 February. During 15 February-4 March she took part in the raids on Honshu Island, Japan, and the Nansei Shoto, as well as supporting the landings on Iwo Jima. She also took part in the 5th Fleet strikes against Japan (17 March-26 May) and the 3rd Fleet strikes (27 May-11 June). After embarking a new air group at Leyte (13 June-1 July) she rejoined the 3rd Fleet for the final strikes against the Japanese home islands (10 July-15 August).
Belleau Wood launched her planes 2 September for the mass flight over Tokyo, Japan, during the surrender ceremonies. She remained in Japanese waters until 13 October. Arriving at Pearl Harbor 28 October, she departed three days later with 1,248 servicemen for San Diego. She remained on ""Magic Carpet"" duty, returning servicemen from Guam and Saipan to San Diego, until 31 January 1946. During the next year Belleau Wood was moored at various docks in the San Francisco area undergoing inactivation. She was placed out of commission in reserve at Alameda Naval Air Station 13 January 1947. She remained in reserve until transferred to France 5 September 1953 under the Mutual Defense Assistance Program.
Belleau Wood received the Presidential Unit Citation and twelve battle stars during World War II.",en,reference

"A inquiry about the nature of prints and their fleeting moments of acquirement
I have a few questions about prints that I hope people will answer. No! It’s not that kind of questions! It’s just that I’m interested to hear about other people’s view on those things.
(A) For people who do prints:
- If you do prints, do you limit them?
- If yes, why? Is there some thought behind it, a conscious decision or is it just that’s how it’s done by everyone else?
- Is it worth the hassle?
(B) For people who want prints:
- What’s your take on limited runs?
- The scarcity or the time limit, which of these are more motivational?",en,web
"You know how artists say that when you do art, just let it come to life on its own. Just let your hands do the strokes, let the paint brushes bring color and vibrancy to your work, and just let it grow into a masterpiece. Well here’s what happened on the eve of Christmas eve last year. Splashed on some shades of yellow, dipped my brush on the luscious red palette and dumped in on the canvas without any idea on what I would be painting.
I ended up with this and saw four of the most important people in my life. They’ve been there for almost all of the most important and happiest moments in my life. They all make me happy and feel loved through all the little presents and messages they sent me. They make me laugh so much that tears of glitter dust would stream down my face. I love them and I would cherish them forever. Merry Christmas to my aunts, Lu, Len and Ann and to my one and only boyfriend, my dad.",en,books

"Reaching a plea agreement for mass killer Jared Lee Loughner is one step.
Today, defense attorneys and prosecutors will need to accomplish the next: convince U.S. District Court Judge Larry A. Burns that Loughner, who has been forcibly medicated at a federal prison, is no longer mentally unfit for trial.
If Burns agrees, as legal experts expect, a formal change of plea hearing will follow. That's when those in the court could hear from the 23-year-old at length for the first time, as the judge questions him.
Loughner, who was brought to Tucson on Monday from a federal medical facility in Missouri, will be asked to admit that he shot and killed six people, including the top federal judge in Arizona, and wounded 13 others, including former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords.
He'll need to convince Burns he understands what is going on, what he's doing and what he did.",en,reference

"Israel says bomb blast hits bus in Tel Aviv
A bomb ripped through an Israeli bus near the nation's military headquarters in Tel Aviv on Wednesday, wounding at least 10 people, Israeli officials said.
The attack came as diplomats, including U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, shuttled around the region to try to broker a cease fire following a weeklong Israeli offensive against Palestinian militants in Gaza that has killed more than 130 Palestinians. Militant rocket fire into Israel has killed five Israelis.
The bus exploded about noon on one of the coastal city's busiest arteries, near the Tel Aviv museum and across from an entrance to Israel's national defense headquarters.
The bus was charred and blackened, its side windows blown out and its glass scattered on the asphalt. The wounded were evacuated and blood was splattered on the sidewalk.
An Israeli driver who witnessed the explosion told Army Radio the bus was ""completely charred inside."" Another witness said there were few passengers on the bus when it exploded. The witnesses spoke to Israeli TV and were not identified.
Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said authorities were investigating whether the bomb had been planted and left on the bus or whether it was the work of a suicide bomber.
""We strongly believe that this was a terror attack,"" he said.
He said that of the 10 wounded, three were moderately to seriously hurt.
More than 1,000 Israelis were killed during the violent Palestinian uprising in the last decade in bombings and shooting attacks. More than 5,000 Palestinians were killed as well.
The last bombing in Tel Aviv was in April 2006, when a Palestinian suicide bomber killed 11 people at a sandwich stand near the city's old central bus station. A bomb left at a bus stand in Jerusalem last year killed one person.
In Gaza, the Tel Aviv bombing was praised from mosque loudspeakers, while Hamas' television interviewed people praising the attack as a return of militants' trademark tactics.
There was no official comment from Hamas or Islamic Jihad.",en,web

"I had my baby girl at 39+4days on 3rd March 2012...
My husband and I did dtd on Thursday morning, straight away I had a bloody show but nothing happened until Friday evening, I wanted to dtd again, managed to persuaded my husband to do it
No contractions afterward so thought maybe it not my time yet, watched television then was about to get off the sofa to go bed but I felt a pop! Yes at 10.30pm my water broke, a lot of water gushing, we was so exciting, rang the labour ward, told us to go in but there chance for us to send home as this is my first baby. Rang the taxi, my contractions began, to be frankly they do bloody hurt so much I want to cry!
Arrived the labour ward just after 12am, no room was given, so we was send to waiting room with other people, I felt angry and embarrassed as I was in f**king pain, told the midwife I was really serious in pain, they moved me to other waiting room but no one here, waited for about a hour, I felt dizzy and so much pain, my husband was fuming and told someone, finally someone took me in, got given the room, luckily had really lovely midwife, checked me, already 4cm at 1.15am, my husband and I really thought we would be in for long morning, so I had gas and air, they do help but didn't take the pain away, I was out of it to notice it, I asked for epidural, they offered me wiser birth to see how it goes, I agree, went to birth centre, waited for water bath to be ready, but unfortunately I was in so much pain and started to leaking blood, they decided to cancelled the water bath and send me back to labour, checked me again I was already 10cm at 3.40am!!! Ready to push until 4.12am I had my beautiful baby girl Pollyanna Jane Tovey weighting 7lbs1oz on 3rd March! She had full dark hair, look like his daddy!
No snitches nor tears, I recovered quickly, we moved to other ward, fortunately we both was allowed to send home that day.
Just the kind of labour I hoped for and did successful!
We both are very much in love with her and still on
Will upload picture of my little Polly soon as when I'm on laptop as I am on iPad at the moment.

"Some are already calling it the unofficial state title game -- and who can blame them? It's Deerfield-Windsor against Mount de Sales in a classic matchup in the GISA Class AAA state semifinals on Friday night at Webb Memorial Stadium.
""It's a high-powered offense against a fierce defense,'' said DWS' Quentin Heard, who plays both ways for the Knights. ""It's a game a lot of people (in GISA) have been waiting for.''
There are six local area teams in the playoffs, but the Deerfield-Mount de Sales game is the highlight of this week's playoff round.
The games are just as big in Camilla, where Westwood's unbeaten Wildcats (11-0) meet Briarwood in the GISA Class A state semifinals, and in Damascus, where the Warriors of Southwest Georgia Academy face Edmund Burke (8-3) in the GISA Class AA state semifinals.
Westwood destroyed Curtis Baptist, 52-13, and it could have been worse. There was a running clock in the second half.
Freshman running back J.T. Edore rushed for 213 yards on only nine
carries and scored twice, and quarterback Mason Worsham threw three TD passes (two to John Vereen) and ran for two more. Westwood's defense made nine plays for no gain or losses, including eight in the first half when the first unit was on the field.
Briarwood escaped with a 30-28, last-second win against Randolph Southern, which finished third in the region race behind Westwood and Terrell Academy.
Two-time defending GISA Class A state champ Terrell Academy (6-4-1) is looking for its third consecutive berth in the state championship game, but has to go on the road to face the defending GISA Class AA state champ Memorial Day in Savannah.
The Eagles are always dangerous but they have their work in front of them. Memorial Day beat Thomas Jefferson, 48-20, and beat Briarwood, 42-0, this year. Terrell Academy just beat Thomas Jefferson, 30-25, last week to advance to the semifinals.
SGA (9-1) has won nine in a row and the kids from Damascus believe this is their year. It looked like it last week when the Warriors shut out Robert Toombs, 21-0, in the first round. Junior quarterback Dillon Driver had a big night, completing 14 passes for 141 yards and rushing for 97 yards, and Troupe Tabb ran for two touchdowns. The SGA defense held Toombs to negative 17 yards in the second half.
Edmund Burke (8-3 and the No. 2 seed from GISA Region 1-A) beat Arlington Christian, 35-16, to advance. SGA beat Arlington, 26-18, earlier this season, and based on those scores this one could be a toss up.
The biggest game of the week, however, is at Deerfield, because the two powers seem so evenly matched and because both have anticipated the showdown.
""That's a great team,'' DWS coach Allen Lowe said. ""They're loaded with talent. Our kids know what's coming in here on Friday night.''
Deerfield is trying to become the first Knights team in history to get to 12-0, and a win puts DWS in the state title game for the third consecutive year.
Mount de Sales (10-1), meanwhile, is loaded on offense and features a pair of talented running backs in Chris Swain (1,359 yards, 20 TDs and a 15.6 yards-per-carry average) and Myles Swain (664 yards on 12 TDs, and a 13.59 average). Mount de Sales quarterback Bradley Smith has rushed for 364 yards and four TDs, and he has completed 63-of-96 passes for 1,262 yards and 16 TDs, while being intercepted only four times all year.
The Knights picked off three passes in last week's convincing, 38-14, win against Griffin Christian Academy. Banks Kinslow had two of those, and ran one back 50 yards to the Griffin 8-yard-line. Davis Moore picked off the other one and ran it back 12 yards for a TD.
Kinslow also threw a TD pass, and Moore (131 yards on 15 carries) and Heard (109 yards on 19 carries) carried the ball and the load in that victory.
But DWS has lived on its defense all season, and that's what makes this showdown so intriguing, because Mount de Sales is averaging more than 45 points a game, and Deerfield is allowing fewer than seven a game.
Those are the four matchups in GISA. Two Southwest Georgia GHSA teams are still alive in the second round of the five-round public school playoffs.
Americus-Sumter (7-4) is coming off an upset against Washington County, but now must face defending Class AAA state champ Sandy Creek (11-0) on the road in the Class AAA state playoffs, while Miller County (8-3), which pulled off a huge upset last week against Calvary Day, is on the road in the Class A state playoffs against Clinch County (11-0), the No. 1-ranked team in the GSWA state poll.
Americus-Sumter may have a bigger obstacle than Miller County because Sandy Creek has won 25 games in a row and 36 of its last 38. It hasn't lost a game since Aug. 28, 2009.
The Panthers have made the most of dropping from Class AAAA to Class AAA this season and went 5-1 in the Region 1-AAA race, losing only to Cairo. But they have found themselves in a tough bracket, first facing Washington County and now Sandy Creek, which hammered Perry, 44-3, in the first round of the playoffs.
Americus-Sumter comes in with some momentum after beating WACO, 28-16, thanks to QB Malik Thomas' big night. Thomas threw for 256 yards and three TDs in the win.
Miller finished third in the tough Region 1-A race but is the lone team standing in Class A in Southwest Georgia. The Pirates (8-3) lost to Mitchell County and Seminole County in the region race, but both of those teams were eliminated last week. Mitchell, the No. 1 seed, fell to Savannah Christian, 17-7, at home but Miller beat Calvary Day -- the only team to beat Savannah Christian all year -- on the road. Seminole's season ended against Savannah.
Region 2-A champ Clinch County is loaded on both sides of the ball and has held opponents to just nine points a game this season while averaging 45 points a game. Miller's stars Juwan Jones and T.T. Barber will have to have big nights to pull off an upset.
But don't count Miller County out. The Pirates were trailing Calvary Day, 21-0, last week when they stormed back to win, 34-21.",en,web
"With a diverse array of possibilities for consumers to purchase product or services from your website, SEO only represents one attention funnel for driving qualified visitors to your pages.
Regardless of how consumers arrive, whether they (1) clicked a link from PPC pay per click ad (2) conducted a search in a search engine (3) clicked a banner advertisement or (4) followed a link from a directory, blog or website linking to you, the fact is, now that they HAVE arrived, it’s all about conversion and conversion optimization.
Traffic is Only One Variable
With SEO, determining key performance indicators that are clear, cut and dried to assess the quality of traffic. What may not be so clear to prospects reaching your website is what action they need to take to complete the desired objective. This is where the adage “you can bring a horse to water, but you can’t make them drink” has a distinct parallel in search engine marketing. Getting the traffic is half the battle, however, getting that same user to engage your offer is the real reason for developing a traffic funnel to begin with.
Here are a Few Other Metrics for Consideration:
View the time spent on your site by page and (1) determine the average time on key landing pages with most traffic and then (2) find the dead space and fill it with an action item to funnel diffused attention (like a widget, graphic, etc.).
Despite the fact they we love our own content, most people skim and do not really READ your content word for word. This is why it is important to have visual aids (supporting images) or methods to refocus their attention.
Most people read 200 words per minute, knowing this, you should add an actionable item after 400 words (since most people skim 1-2 minutes to extract the gist of your offer). Naturally, you can adjust this metric based on analytics data whereby you have a high bounce rate or your website just does not meet the relevance or requirements of the visitor.
Make it Easy for the Reader to TAKE ACTION
By using graphics, bullets, numbers with steps to break things up, graphic representations such as, pie charts or illustrations to convey supporting positive interaction you can triple or quadruple conversion. Please note that traffic can drift in on one keyword and if you are looking at one metric alone negate the fact that a user can change their mind.
If you feature enough supporting elements to aid the conversion objective the original intent can be transcended and someone who may have had the intention of just browsing around gets the feel good effect from your content and decides to take you up on your offer. We implemented a similar strategy where we used the top 3 landing pages on our site and incorporated action items in the key areas where attention wavers and lead generation increased lead gen 10 fold.
Also, by calculating the number of steps a person is willing to execute to be considered a qualified lead such as filling out a quick form with 2 fields (name and email) vs. name, email, best time to reach you, mothers maiden name, what color underwear you are wearing, etc… Just stick to the basics, build the relationship, provide value and let them know in at least three spots on the page (if it permits) what they gain from taking that action then measure the results.
This simplified tactic can single-handedly transform lackluster pages to stellar blockbuster landing pages. The takeaway here is, SEO is great, but SEO fused with common sense and value based conversion marketing is even better.",en,web

"Georges de Scudéry
BiographyHe is the older brother of Madeleine de Scudéry with which he will write several novels published under his only name. He chooses initially the military career, but in 1630 gives up it to devote itself entirely to the writing. In 1637, at the time of the quarrel having followed the publication of the Cid of Crow, it lines up resolutely in the camp of the adversaries of the part.
It will profit a long time from the protection of the cardinal of Richelieu and, after the disappearance of the minister, it adopts a careful neutrality with regard to the cardinal Mazarin, which appoints it governor of the fort of Our-Lady-of-the-Guard with Marseilles (1644-1647) and a master's certificate of the galères confers to him, purely honorary load though lucrative.
Having taken party for the Large Cop during the Sling, it is exiled in Normandy and is fixed at Rouen, where it marries in 1657 the rich person Marie-madeleine (or Marie-Francoise) of Martinvast (1631-1712), which will maintain a long correspondence with Roger de Bussy-Rabutin. He is elected member of the French Academy in 1650.

"San Clemente Green was not an anti-nuclear group until whistleblowers from San Onofre came to me to protect them from harrasment for reporting safety concerns. With first hand knowledge of the most dangerous nuclear power plant in the USA, turning away from the issue is not an option for me. Trying to balance my efforts between activism and my career in architectural illustration is a constant challenge. With so much at stake, nearly everything else gets put off when there is a call to action on the nuclear power issue.

"Lord Kenneth Clark is one of my intellectual heroes. Clark, who died in 1983, was for many years the director of the National Gallery in London and was generally recognized as one of the most insightful and influential art critics of the twentieth century. He burst into the popular consciousness in 1969 when his television program “Civilisation: A Personal View” became an unexpected international sensation. I watched this ten part series (and devoured the accompanying book) when I was a teen-ager, and Clark’s perspectives massively shaped my own thinking about history, aesthetics, and philosophy. When, a few years ago, I embarked on the production of a ten part documentary about Catholicism, emphasizing both the truth and the artistic beauty of the church, Kenneth Clark was my model and inspiration.
I had the privilege just a few nights ago to address the annual Iftar Dinner which was held at the Islamic Cultural Center in Niles. This event—at the heart of which is a festive meal signaling the end of the daily Ramadan fast—brings Christians and Muslims together for fellowship, prayer, and conversation. I had been asked to reflect briefly on the topic of the future of religion in America. Given my religiously mixed audience, I decided to speak on the responsibility that all people of faith have in the presence of the growing threat of ideological secularism in our society. A 2008 Pew Forum study showed that the fastest-growing “religious” denomination in American is the “nones,” those who claim no formal religious affiliation. It furthermore showed that there is no substantial difference in the attitudes of believers and non-believers in regard to a wide range of moral and political issues. What both of these data indicate is that secularism—the conviction that God, even if he exists, doesn’t much matter—is on the rise.
Perhaps you’ve heard of Christopher Hitchens. He is a British writer and cultural commentator who lives and works in Washington, D.C. For decades now, he has been observing the political/societal scene and writing about it in a particularly insightful, witty, and acerbic manner. Early in his career, he was something of a Trotskyite, but in the years following September 11th, he emerged as a strong advocate of the Iraq war and, much to the chagrin of his colleagues on the left, a supporter of George W. Bush. He is best known, certainly, for his recent contributions as a critic of religion. His book God is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything appeared a couple of years ago and proved to be a bestseller. Since the publication of this text, Hitchens has travelled the country debating a series of religious thinkers—Christian, Muslim, and Jewish—meeting them with an extremely swift mind and wickedly barbed tongue. Along with Sam Harris, Daniel Dennett, and Richard Dawkins, he is one of the “four horsemen” of the New Atheism, the movement that advocates an aggressive, take-no-prisoners approach to the claims of faith. I think it’s fair to say that Hitchens is playing today the role that another brilliant Englishman, Bertrand Russell, played nearly a century ago, namely, that of religion’s public enemy number one.
I’ve written often about Christopher Hitchens, the world’s most prominent atheist. Most recently, I did a piece on the CNN blog, urging Christians to pray for Hitchens as he battles a very serious form of cancer—and to my astonishment, this benign recommendation was met with an extraordinarily negative reaction from atheists. But that’s a story for another day. On my recent vacation, I took two books with me, Christopher Hitchens’s memoir Hitch-22, which I had begun and wanted to finish, and his brother Peter Hitchens’s The Rage Against God: How Atheism Led Me to Faith, a stunning account of the younger Hitchens’s journey through militant Trotskyite atheism to a robust Christianity. It was a fascinating, and I must admit rather unnerving, experience to overhear, as it were, the brothers Hitchens debating with one another in my own head. Things got so intense that Christopher Hitchens actually appeared in one of my dreams during the vacation!
So many people had urged me to comment on the new film “Eat, Pray, Love” that I felt obligated to see it on its opening weekend. The theater in which I viewed the movie was pretty much full, and the gender ratio was approximately 92% female, 8% male. The storyline of “Eat, Pray, Love” adheres fairly closely to the classic spiritual quest trajectory. As the narrative commences, our heroine, Liz Gilbert (played by Julia Roberts), finds herself in a sort of mid-life crisis. Her marriage has lost its spark, her job is going nowhere, and her friends don’t know how to help her. In one of the most affecting moment in the movie, Liz kneels down and, with tears, simply begs God to show her the way.",en,books
"The Click Five - Modern Minds And Pastimes Review
Fresh bubblegum taste does not last long.
The Click Five's sophomore effort drifts between solid guitar-fuelled power pop and bland lite-rock fodder that sounds older than any of the band's members. Half the album, like the stale '80s leftover ""Addicted To Me"", blips by with danceable bass lines and drippy synthesizers. The band uses their keyboards throughout, but when they remember to crank up the guitars a bit, the results are undeniably infectious bubblegum pop. The album rips open with the thrusting hook of ""Flipside"", making up for the saccharine background harmonies and heavy synth. The guitar-focused, buried synth sound of ""When I'm Gone"" gets a rock edge, missing from too much of the album.
The Click Five are at their best when kicking up the tempo, only putting listeners to sleep with mid-tempo balladry on tracks like ""The Reason Why"" and obligatory acoustic ""Mary Jane"". The band turns even their cheesier efforts into winners with cranked-up guitars. The distant chugging riffs and ultra-catchy melody turn ""Jenny"" into a power pop gem, despite the syrupy new wave synth blaring throughout. The heavy thrust of riffs in the hook turn the otherwise breezy belated ""Happy Birthday"" into a potential earworm.
Modern Minds And Pastimes is an unfortunately uneven listen with enough catchy bubblegum pop to make it worth a listen, but not worth keeping the entire album on your iPod for long. The album definitely serves as evidence in favor of the .99 iTunes single song purchase ability.

"Sometimes, peanut butter cookies just need to step up their game. I mean, I like them and all, but they are rather plain. Good, but plain.
My grandmother liked raw peanut butter cookie dough- she didn’t too much care for the baked cookie. On the other hand, peanut butter cookies were one of my grandfather’s favorites (not sure if he liked the dough though).
Sorry- I kinda got off track there.
So, I was starting to make peanut butter cookie dough, and opened my pantry for some inspiration. There, in front of me, was an unopened jar of chunky peanut butter. And next to that- chocolate chips! (ok, not really- they are in 2 separate cupboards, but it made the story sound good-right?!) Chocolate and peanut butter- I think most of us would agree that they are a good combination. I know I would! So, my plain peanut butter cookie dough got jazzed up a bit. I think you’ll like it!
CHUNKY PEANUT BUTTER CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES
Prep time: 10 minutes Bake time: 10-13 minutes
1 cup butter, softened
1 cup sugar
1 cup brown sugar
1 cup crunchy/chunky peanut butter
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda
2 1/2 cups flour
1 1/2 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips
Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
In large mixing bowl combine butter, sugars, and peanut butter. Mix until well combined. Add in eggs and stir. Add salt, baking powder, and baking soda and mix well. Stir in flour till just combined. Gently stir in chocolate chips.
Using a large ice cream scoop, scoop dough onto parchment paper lined cookie sheets. Bake for 10 to 13 minutes, or until lightly golden brown and set. Remove from oven and let cool for 5 minutes. Remove from cookie sheet and place on cooling racks to cool completely. Enjoy with a glass of cold milk!

Beloved, I notice everything & hear the cry of every broken heart before it is uttered.

"RIVER CLUB — A smile spread across Dehlia Garrity’s face as she flitted down the hallway of Braden River Elementary School.
Besides walking her two sons down these hallways many years ago, the first-grade teacher has spent almost her entire teaching career here. Fellow teachers Charlotte Gillott, Sue Tschappat, Donna Hart and Stephanie Lloyd have been at Braden River since the day it opened more than 20 years ago.
And on May 21, they and other educators gathered in the school’s media center for an informal 20th anniversary celebration.
“It was so exciting,” said Gillott of the school’s opening. “I had to drive out here to see the construction from the day I knew I was going to be here. I still have pictures of it in my album.”
The school opened in August 1988 under the direction of Principal Dote Shields, who handpicked Braden River’s first staff.
“I didn’t realize how lucky I was to be here until I found out there was a 12-page list of teachers who wanted to be there,” Gillott said.
But the camaraderie experienced among new staff members was instantaneous. Teachers pulled together, eagerly picking out equipment and supplies in preparation for the arrival of students who were redistricted from Oneco, Bashaw and Daughtrey elementary schools.
“It was the most special time to be able to open a new school,” Tschappat said. “Mr. Shields just had this ability to pull us together and make us feel like a family.
“We were getting kids from several different schools and that’s difficult sometimes,” she said. “The children felt part of that family atmosphere, too.”
A dedication ceremony was held on Feb. 12, 1989.
The feeling of being the Braden River Wranglers family has stayed strong throughout the years, regardless of who has been at the school’s helm. Teachers said they lend each other their support, sharing lesson plans for classes or helping one another when a need arises. They also have walked together through more personal issues such as births and weddings and divorces and deaths.
“We’ve all got each other’s backs,” Lloyd said.
Over the years as the East County has grown, Braden River’s student population has reflected that growth — first ballooning to overcrowded status and then finding relief when neighboring schools such as McNeal opened. At its peak, the school had more than 1,200 students.
As current and former educators flipped through scrapbooks of photos at the anniversary celebration, they made sure to point out each other’s children or old friends while swapping stories of the last 20 years at the school.
“It’s hard to believe (it’s been so long),” said substitute teacher Leah McElroy, who was the school’s first guidance counselor. “It went so fast.”

"As you know, organizing is a big task. Some people only need to organize a little, and still others need to organize their entire scrapbooking areas. Many scrapbookers are in need of storage solutions for often used supplies, and still others are looking for storage solutions for everything. So where exactly do you start? Simple – from the very beginning.
The first step to effective organization is to figure out what you have. In order to do this, you must first sort all of your materials and supplies into categories. It is also easier to do this by sorthing them into large, broad categories first.
Here are some great categories, and what belongs in them:
- Adhesives – This should include tapes, liquids, glue dots, glue sticks, runners and anything else you use.
- Cutting Tools – Your cutters, scissors, decorative scissors, blades and anything else you need. This can also include die cut tools and their accessories.
- Photographs and Negatives – Even if you primarily use digital now, you are still going to have dozens of photographs that need to find a storage home, and in addition, you probably still have plenty of negatives lying around. I still use my film camera in addition to my digital, so this is a pressing issue for me.
- Embellishments – Easy enough. Anything that is used to embellish your pages; metals, stickers, buttons, ribbons, eyelets, clips, corners, glitter, beads, etc.
- Stamping Supplies – If it belongs with a rubber stamp, or it is a rubber stamp, this is the category for it.
- Papers – Any shape, size, texture or pattern. They all go in this broad category. Yes, even the scraps.
- Writing and Drawing Tools – journaling pens, colored pencils, chalk, markers, watercolors, paints and anything else you’d like to include.
- Misc. Tools – This is a rather broad category, but can include anything you might not want to have its own category. For instance, you might only own 5 or 6 rubber stamps, so this category is for that. Other items include: punches, templates, embossing tools, brass stencils, etc.
And last but not least:
- Organization Supplies – Containers of all shapes and sizes, folders, baskets, labels, drawers, totes, and anything else you might have to begin your organizing.

"Meg Whitman is bound to outspend Jerry Brown in their contest for governor this fall, but the attorney general has a leg up on her in one arena: Publicity as the state's top prosecutor.
He's been making more use of his in-house communications office over the past two years, spreading the word about both the state's pursuit of justice and the guy in charge who happens to be running for governor.
His information shop is staffed with four writers and spokespersons, up from two earlier in Brown's term, A.G. Director of Communications Jim Finefrock said.
Brown's office issued 76 news releases in 2007, his first year on the job. It delivered 100 in 2008.
Last year, the attorney general's office published 136 news releases about such topics as raids, legal opinions and Brown's thoughts on Massachusetts Sen. Ted Kennedy's passing.
Last week, the 76th news release of 2010 from Brown's office crossed my desk. It was a warning about a rise in short-sale frauds.
Finefrock says there's no connection between his work and the campaign.
""Legally, we're prohibited from campaigning,"" he said. ""We do observe the firewall between the attorney general's office and the campaign.""
I read him the numbers I listed above. He said they showed the communications staff was doing its job well.
""It's kind of a nice compliment that we're doing our job trying to get the word out,"" he said.
Indeed, as an editor, I have never complained about having too much information from the attorney general's office. More often we're looking for ways to get past the press shop and find the news you deserve to read in your paper.
But the waves of news releases reflect a perk of incumbency in an election that pits billionaire outsider Whitman against career politician Brown. News about Brown's work in office reinforces his argument to voters that his experience makes him better prepared to lead the state again.
""Brown has the soapbox to disseminate information to the public and the news media,"" said Stephen Nicholson, a political science professor at the University of California at Merced.
""He can show how he's knowledgeable, certainly in areas that are important to Californians, and also that he's still doing his job while he's campaigning for governor,"" Nicholson said.
That's a common strategy for many of your elected leaders. State Superintendent Jack O'Connell is known to flood an inbox with news releases, as is Sen. Jeff Denham of Atwater.
Most of Brown's news releases highlight stings, arrests, gang crackdowns and legal opinions -- the stuff you expect from a state justice department.
A few steer into headline-grabbing political fights, like Brown's April 13 decision to expand an investigation in the California State University Stanislaus Foundation over its decision to hire GOP lightning rod Sarah Palin to speak at a fund-raiser without disclosing her fee.
""This is not about Sarah Palin,"" Brown said in that release.
Agreed, the foundation should release that number. But it doesn't hurt Brown -- or his own political fortunes -- to appear to target a Republican whom Democrats despise.
""You can often have multiple purposes for what you're doing in getting the word out,"" said David Frederickson, a visiting professor of communications at the University of the Pacific in Stockton who has worked for the past four Republican presidents.
""You always have to be careful to avoid overt campaigning,"" he said. ""But at the same time, if you have an agenda, and you're out there doing it, accomplishing the things (voters) sent you there to do, you should get the word out.""

"USA Today Weekly Listings Point Out the Best Online Video
The national newspaper now includes online video listings, reflecting the importance of streamed programming.
What to watch, what to watch? For online videos, it's an even harder question than with broadcast TV. With so many sites offering original and premium programming, even dedicated online viewers can feel overwhelmed. To help out, USA Today has begun a new offering: a weekly print and online listing called ""TV on the Web.""
USA Today's listings are hand-selected by editors and span all popular categories, including animation, comedy, drama, entertainment, tech and gaming, and family. They focus on web series, rather than viral video hits.
Visitors first encounter a top picks page showing nine current videos. Our only complaint is that the pages aren't user-friendly at first glance: visitors need to mouse over the images to get descriptions for each show. The listings pages would be more helpful if they showed short descriptions automatically, so that visitors can scan the selections and make a choice.
""With celebrities such as Tom Hanks and Jerry Seinfeld entering the web-only space, and alternative programming sites such as YouTube, Hulu, and Netflix carrying exclusive programming, the time has come to reflect the changing media landscape. This is the natural evolution of where TV programming is headed and USA Today is at the forefront,"" says Larry Kramer, president and publisher of USA Today.",en,web
"Eating spicy foods, such as pizza, may cause a person to feel heartburn. Although the name may imply the heart, heartburn has nothing to do with the heart itself. Heartburn is pain felt in the chest by a burning sensation in the esophagus, which is located close to where the heart is.
Here you can see the pizza passing from the mouth to the esophagus and on to the stomach. At junction between the stomach and esophagus is the lower esophageal sphincter. This muscular sphincter acts as a valve that normally keeps food and stomach acid in the stomach and prevents the stomach’s contents from regurgitating back into the esophagus.
However, certain foods may affect the lower esophageal sphincter, making it less effective. That’s how heartburn begins. The stomach produces hydrochloric acid to digest food. The stomach has a mucous lining that protects it from hydrochloric acid, but the esophagus does not.
So, when food and stomach acid regurgitate back into the esophagus, a burning feeling is felt near the heart. This feeling is known as heartburn. Antacids may be used to relieve heartburn by making stomach juices less acidic, therefore reducing the burning feeling felt in the esophagus. If heartburn becomes frequent or prolonged, medical intervention may be necessary to correct the problem.",en,reference
"Amazingly, if we were actually able to convert matter perfectly to energy with 1 kg of matter being completely annihilated, the energy produced from just that small amount of matter is about 42.95 mega tons of TNT. So an adult male weighing in at around 200 pounds has somewhere in the vicinity of 4000 megatons of TNT potential in their matter if completely annihilated.
This is about 80 times more energy than was produced by the largest ever detonated nuclear bomb, the Tzar Bomba, which itself produced a blast about 1,400 times more powerful than the combined explosions of the bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
To further illustrate, 1 megaton of TNT, when converted to kilowatt hours, makes enough electricity to power an average American home for about 100,000 years. It is also enough to power the entire United States for a little over 3 days. So 1 kg of some matter being completely annihilated would be able to power the entire United States for about four months. One average adult male then, when completely annihilated, would produce enough energy to power the U.S. for about 30 years. Energy crisis solved.
On a completely baffling scale, a typical supernova explosion will give off about 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 megatons of TNT. *cowers in the corner*",en,reference

"Testing on rocket engine’s ‘heart’ concludes at Stennis
by MBJ Staff
Published: December 17,2012
HANCOCK COUNTY — NASA has taken another step toward human exploration of new destinations in the solar system.
At the agency’s Stennis Space Center, engineers conducted the final test-firing of the J-2X powerpack assembly, an important component of America’s next heavy-lift rocket.
The J-2X engine is the first human-rated liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen engine developed in the United States in decades. Designed and built by NASA and industry partner Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne of Canoga Park, Calif., the engine will power the upper stage of NASA’s 143-ton Space Launch System (SLS) rocket. The powerpack is a system of components on top of the engine that feeds propellants to the bell nozzle of the engine to produce thrust.
The powerpack was worked out separately from the engine to more thoroughly test its limits. It also can be operated under a wider range of conditions. The tests provide a trove of data to compare with analytical predictions of the performance of several parts in the turbopump and flexible ducts.
“These tests at Stennis are similar to doctor-ordered treadmill tests for a person’s heart,” said Tom Byrd , J-2X engine lead in the SLS Liquid Engines Office at Marshall in Huntsville, Ala. “The engineers who designed and analyze the turbopumps inside the powerpack are like our doctors, using sensors installed in the assembly to monitor the run over a wide range of stressful conditions. We ran the assembly tests this year for far longer than the engine will run during a mission to space, and acquired a lot of valuable information that will help us improve the development of the J-2X engine.”
The powerpack assembly burned millions of pounds of propellants during a series of 13 tests totaling more than an hour and a half in 2012. The testing team set several records for hot-firing duration at Stennis test stands during the summer. NASA engineers will remove the assembly from the test stand to focus on tests of the fully integrated engine. Installation on a test stand at Stennis will begin in 2013.
The SLS will launch NASA’s Orion spacecraft and other payloads from the agency’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida, providing an entirely new capability for human exploration beyond low Earth orbit. The program is managed at Marshall.

"Lord, save me from the ""Best Little Whorehouse"" hypocrisy washing over America this very minute.
Let me say that I have deep respect for the true believers, whether they are devoutly Christians or not, conservative, liberal or somewhere in between.
But this Janet Jackson thing has people going, Oh, there is sex on television, oh the nation is going to hell.
If you remember the play and movie about a house of ill repute in Texas you will remember that things were fine for a long time. Politicians and winning football teams came to the establishment and suddenly some television reporter says there is a whorehouse in Texas and everyone expressed total shock. The outrage machine had to gear up and stop this atrocity.
Now hearings may be held on decency on television because oh, my goodness, milk is not the only thing being sold on television.
Duh, where have these people been. Sex, partial nudity, adult situations, off color jokes, bad language, have dominated television for decades now.
Madison Avenue has ruled the advertising mentality, convincing us that if we are lonely, depressed, can't get a date, just buy a $45,000 car, put on overpriced Speedo's and drive down to the beach and suddenly eight buxomy women are falling all over you. Never mind that you are 5'6"" and weigh 300 pounds and that the only push-up you have done in years is to push up closer to that big plate of food.
Television is not big in telling you to keep that 10-year-old car, lose a bunch of weight and set your standards on a date with someone who is not superficially attracted to the price of things.
Reality shows, sit-coms, commercials, talk shows have been pushing sex and nudity for years. The same network executives who are outraged and shocked by seeing part of Jackson's anatomy are the ones who shoved big butts in our faces on NYPD Blue years ago in prime time. The standards regulators rushing to defend our sensitive eyes and morals are the same ones who sat by while some guy walks around naked on ""Survivor"" or beautiful people frolicked naked in hot tubs in everything from The Real World to The Bachelor.
Did the regulators ever ask the sponsors just how spending $4 on a certain shaving cream that should cost 75 cents is going to get those scantily clad women chasing you. Just what is the secret ingredient?
Do you remember those horrible Calvin Klein commercials that looked like an audition for a porn tape? Grainy video of teens in a basement being interviewed and then asked to tear off part of their shirts. The ads were yanked after an outcry, but remember television didn't have any problem taking Calvin Klein's money to run them. Calvin Klein, who knows how to take $6 worth of blue jean material and a 50 cent an hour third world sewer and add lots of sex appeal and marketing and sell that garment for $100, knew exactly what he was doing. He got people talking about the commercials.
My fear is that the cure is worse than the ailment, often when bureaucrats get involved. Now that everyone has Oh, my gosh, discovered that the television networks have a whorehouse operating there is now a mad rush to shut it down.
The only thing worse than network television today is network television tomorrow after bureaucrats have gotten involved. I still maintain that if there are 100 million television sets in America there are 100 million censors. It is known as the channel changer. Did I watch what's his name run around naked on Survivor, crinkled picture or not? No, I did not. The censor at my house flipped it to the History Channel. Did I watch beautiful people frolicking in a hot tub on the Real World. Yes I did. I was watching the program already and when it occurred the censor said that was ok at my house to keep watching. Was I so outraged by Ms. Jackson's display that my censor turned off the Super Bowl. No, I was upstairs eating more food when the display occurred and even if I had seen it my censor was pulling for the Carolina Panthers. I have seen it 5,000 or so times now on CNN and network news. By my count it has surpassed the Screaming Demon video of Howard Dean. Each time the video of Ms. Jackson is part of a story on whether television has gone too far, whether there should be more decency on television. Duh, CNN look in the mirror. You are showing the very thing you are asking if there is too much of. Hypocrisy, you are alive and well in America.
My point is do you go to Barnes and Noble and complain there are too many romance novels or do you make a bee-line to the science fiction or history sections? Do you go to the buffet and complain to everyone around the salad bar that you don't like beets or do you just not put any beets on your salad while you are piling it up, leaving more beets for the beets-lovers?
Keep the censors, the hypocrites and the do-gooders away from my door. And if CNN and ABC will stop showing outraged reports on this stuff, those of us watching the History Channel or A&E won't even know it occurred.

"Effective leaders pay attention to structure and organization to insure the structure continues to benefit the organization’s mission. Read Deuteronomy 1:1-15.
The universe has overwhelming evidence of God’s use of structure and organization in the intelligent design of creation. Even the simplest living organism is more complex and subtle than the most sophisticated computer. The Bible gives insight into God’s instructions concerning structure and organization to Moses, the leader He chose to lead His people from a time of slavery in Egypt to the Promised Land. When carrying total responsibility for leadership of the people of Israel overwhelmed Moses, God encouraged him to change the organizational structure so as to channel more of Israel’s human resources to fulfill the leadership needs. Wisely Moses accepted God’s counsel.
Effective leaders create structure that addresses the methods by which resources flow through the organization to accomplish work. Read Numbers 11:1-35.
When Moses couldn’t handle all of the responsibilities of leading Israel, God told him to enlist seventy qualified persons, empower them and allow them to help to carry the burden. Moses was overwhelmed and the people under-served so God took action. The existing system wasn’t working so He changed it. It wasn’t about “who’s the boss”, it was about who would serve the people.
Structure and organization has a way of turning chaos into an effective use of resources. Read 1 Corinthians 14:40.
This verse, in a chapter on worship structure, furnishes a valuable glimpse into the public worship of the first-century churches. It stresses that order, structure, form, unity, like mindedness and mutual regard should prevail when believers gather together.
Well-led organizations can accomplish more than any individual can hope to accomplish. Read Exodus 18:1-27.
Moses was overwhelmed by the problems of leading a large number of people. Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, helped Moses to see that organization and structure are essential to effective operation. Not only is work accomplished more efficiently, but people are better served and supported in doing the work.
Effective Christian leaders make long range plans and give God room to actively direct or change those plans. Read Romans 15:22-29.
In today’s verses the Apostle Paul is in process of taking a love offering from the churches in Macedonia to the church in Jerusalem that had fallen on hard times. While on his way to Jerusalem, Paul is writing to the Christians in Rome discussing some long range plans to visit their church on his way to preach the Gospel in Spain.",en,books
"ESF Professor Honored for Wild Turkey Research
SYRACUSE, N.Y. - A professor at the SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry (ESF) has been honored by the National Wild Turkey Federation for his years of pioneering research.
Dr. William F. Porter is the recipient of the 1998 Henry Mosby Award, which honors outstanding achievement in turkey research.
Porter, a wildlife biologist who resides in Skaneateles, is a member of ESF's Faculty of Environmental and Forest Biology. He has been studying wild turkeys for more than 20 years. His work as a graduate student was the first to show that wild turkeys could thrive in agricultural areas and that they did not need mature forests in order to survive.
Another four-year study recently resulted in a booklet, ""The Future of the Wild Turkey,"" which examines the bird's history in the state, its breeding habits, and mortality rate. He and his students have used satellite imagery to examine wild turkeys' habitat on a large scale.
Porter received the award, a sculpture of three wild turkeys on a wooden base, at the federation's annual convention in Indianapolis. The award is named for a biologist who devoted 40 years to wildlife conservation and who helped establish The Wildlife Society.
Porter has been a faculty member at ESF since 1978. He is director of the Adirondack Ecological Center.",en,web

2012 NFL Draft Stock Up
Chandler Jones, DE, Syracuse
Jones has been one of the late risers in the draft process. ESPN's Mel Kiper and Todd McShay were the first two pundits to project Jones as a first-rounder and, not long afterward, NFL Network's Mike Mayock followed suit. Jones's draft stock is aided by the demand for pass rushers. The 6-foot-5, 266-pounder could stay as an end in a 4-3 defense or move to outside linebacker in a 3-4 defense.
Jones had a disappointing performance at the Combine with a slow 40 (4.85) and a low bench-press total (22). He totaled 38 tackles, 4.5 sacks, 7.5 tackles for a loss, two forced fumbles and one interception in just seven games this season. Jones has a nice combination of size and speed that allows him to combine a bull rush with a speed rush. After being a second-day pick for the majority of the lead up to the draft, Jones is now projected to be a first-rounder.
Shea McClellin, OLB, Boise State
The buzz building around McClellin has been ferocious. He had a strong senior season and followed that up with an impressive Combine. McClellin (6-3) ran a fast 40 at 4.62 seconds and was tremendous in the field drills. That was even more impressive considering he added 12 pounds in a month to reach 260 pounds at Indianapolis. McClellin projects as an ideal 3-4 outside linebacker who can rush the passer and drop into coverage.
McClellin recorded 50 tackles, seven sacks, 12.5 tackles for a loss, two interceptions, one forced fumble and a blocked kick this year. Aside from playing as a traditional defensive end, he has lined up as both a stand-up rush linebacker and an inside linebacker. McClellin had 9.5 sacks in 2010. To start his senior season, he had an impressive game and got the better of Georgia offensive tackle Cordy Glenn, a likely first-round pick.
Sources have indicated that there are teams in the middle of the first round that are considering McClellin. They include the Jets and Chargers. It looks like McClellin has a serious shot of going in the top 25 and shouldn't fall past the Patriots at No. 27 or the Packers at No. 28.
Doug Martin, RB, Boise State
The hard-charging Martin has laid claim to being the second-rated running back in the draft over Virginia Tech's David Wilson. Martin has even earned consideration for late in the first round. It wouldn't be surprising if he goes with the 32nd overall pick to the New York Giants. Martin is a complete back in the mold of Ray Rice. At the Senior Bowl and Combine, Martin (5-9, 223) put together excellent showings that illustrate his ability to be a pass receiver and blitz protector at the next level.
Martin put together a quality season in 2011. He averaged five yards per carry with 1,299 yards rushing and 16 touchdowns. Martin also contributed 28 receptions for 263 yards and two scores. He has the speed to rip off long runs and is built powerfully enough to break tackles and pick up yards after contact. The versatile ball-carrier is a skilled kick returner too.
If Martin doesn't go in the first round, he should go in the first 10 picks of the second round. It wouldn't be a complete surprise if Martin goes earlier than many expect. Cincinnati, Detroit or Denver could take him in the 20s.
Amini Silatolu, G/T, Midwestern State
There as been a steady buildup in the buzz around Silatolu, and a lot of teams are showing interest. The 6-foot-4, 311-pounder had a nice showing at the Combine where he displayed quick feet and athleticism in the field drills. Silatolu has gone to visit Carolina, Dallas, Detroit, Minnesota, Tampa Bay, Pittsburgh, Baltimore and New England. He looks like a guard or right tackle in the NFL.
In speaking with one source, Silatolu projects to go in the No. 20-40 range of the draft. The Steelers and Ravens both could use guard help and may take him in the first round. Both teams are said to really like him. Sources also indicated they believe that some teams picking in the latter half of round two would trade up for him if he's available in the second round.
A.J. Jenkins, WR, Illinois
Jenkins is a sleeper wide receiver who has a good number of fans in the scouting and coaching community. The appeal of 6-foot, 190-pounder is his speed to stretch the field while also having some size. Jenkins had a very productive senior season despite the fact that he had poor quarterback play. That was a common hinderance in his time at Illinois. Jenkins caught 90 passes for 1,276 yards and eight touchdowns in 2011. He hauled in 56 passes for 746 yards and seven touchdowns as a junior.
Jenkins performed well at the East-West Shrine before playing some at the Senior Bowl. He had a 40-yard dash time at 4.39 seconds at the Combine. Jenkins looks like he could be a good slot receiver in the NFL who can make some big plays downfield. He has the size to line up on the outside.
Jenkins could turn into a steal. He has moved up towards the top of round three in my 2012 mock draft . Jenkins could go off the board there on draft day, but he might surprise by sneaking into the second round. Jenkins has taken pre-draft visits to the Ravens, Jaguars, Chiefs and 49ers. Ergo, he could go in the No. 60-75 range.
Mike Adams, OT, Ohio State
Adams is really benefitting from a weak class of offensive tackles, and, as usual, there is a high demand for left tackles. There is no doubt that the athletic 6-foot-7, 323-pounder has a great physical skill set to be an NFL left tackle. That tantalizing potential has his stock rising.
The negatives with Adams include his struggles with speed rushers, a questionable work ethic and character concerns stemming from suspensions in college. In the 2012 NFL Draft, he could go in the 20s to Cleveland, Detroit, Pittsburgh, Baltimore or the New York Giants. Adams has taken pre-draft visits to Cleveland, St. Louis, Pittsburgh, Detroit and Buffalo. He also has the ability to move to right tackle.
Brian Quick, WR, Appalachian State
Quick has risen from a mid-round prospect to a second-day pick and could sneak into the second round. Teams are intrigued with his size at 6-foot-4, 220-pounds. He has been a productive receiver over the past few seasons. Quick had his best season in 2011, hauling in 71 catches for 1,096 yards and 11 touchdowns. He totaled 47 catches for 844 yards and nine scores as a junior after hauling in 61 passes for 982 yards and four scores in 2009.
Quick did not impress at the Senior Bowl against the better competition. He fared better later in the week, but is still a bit of a developmental project in the NFL. Quick is a big receiver who looks like a possible red-zone threat on the next level.
There has been a lot of upheaval in the second-day class of wide receivers with stocks rising and falling for the likes of South Carolina's Alshon Jeffery, Rutgers' Mohamed Sanu and LSU's Rueben Randle. Quick has moved up, and there are some that like Quick more than some of those other potential second-rounders.
2012 NFL Draft Stock Down
Cordy Glenn, G/T, Georgia
There are some rumors going around that Glenn could slip in the draft and fall into the second round. During the 2011 college football season, I thought that Glenn was being overrated and was a better fit in the second round. He struggled with speed rushers when he took on Boise State, LSU and Michigan State.
After the season, Glenn battled at the Senior Bowl and helped his stock. There is a wide variety in the opinions of him and that hurts. Some believe he's a first-rounder and can stay at tackle, but others think that he should move inside to guard as a second-round pick. With the big divide in the opinions, Glenn could go lower than expected on draft day.

"Gotham City Imposters (PC) goes Free-to-PlayPosted on Monday, 3rd September 2012 by Avinash Bali
The multiplayer only shooter from developer Monolith, Gotham City Imposters has now gone Free-to-Play on Steam. Like most F2P games on the market, the base game is free but DLC (weapon packs) will have to be paid for. They’ve also (thankfully) ditched Windows Live so matchmaking should be simpler now. I for one enjoyed the game back in the day but was disappointed by the paltry amount of servers. Hopefully with the move to F2P, the game picks up to a certain extent.
Gotham City has gone insane! Batman is up to his pointy ears in unwanted “helpers” determined to dish out their own bloodthirsty brand of vigilante justice in his name (and image). Meanwhile, a small army of self-appointed junior Jokerz has turned the streets of Gotham into a barmy battlefield of bullets, bodies, and bear traps.
In case you’ve never heard of the game before, here’s a video to get you acquainted.Gotham City Imposters / Gotham City Imposters free / Gotham City Imposters free to play / Gotham City Imposters PC / Gotham City Imposters Steam / ivg",en,web
"Other veiws: Proposed WSI rate within reasonA 3.3 percent increase in the average rate Workforce Safety and Insurance uses to determine premiums for employers in North Dakota would reflect a reasonable application of medical inflation and wage growth. It’s essential that WSI maintain an accurate rate, on average, to maintain protections for businesses and workers.
By: The Bismarck Tribune, The Jamestown Sun
A 3.3 percent increase in the average rate Workforce Safety and Insurance uses to determine premiums for employers in North Dakota would reflect a reasonable application of medical inflation and wage growth. It’s essential that WSI maintain an accurate rate, on average, to maintain protections for businesses and workers.
Unfortunately, the rate increase proposed by the WSI advisory board to the governor takes place on an investment backdrop in which employers haven’t seen the dividend rate credits that they had become used to in past years. WSI investment earnings, like for nearly every investor in 2009, were bleak. The resulting reserve fund balance did not exceed the minimum necessary to allow for premium credits to business. The prior year, those credits amounted to 62 percent of an employer’s premium.
The practical result has been businesses paying significantly larger WSI bills.
WSI investments have done better in recent months. In February, the reserve fund balance was at 146 percent of the required reserves. The minimum balance establishing dividend rate credits is 140 percent. Based on that, the expectation is that in June the decision will be made to offer credits beginning July 1.
One of the lessons learned from the meltdown of Wall Street was just how closely networked Main Street and Wall Street are. Investing in stocks and bonds has become so pervasive that no person in America went untouched by the financial crisis.
Although the 3.3 percent average rate increase sounds manageable, for particular segments of North Dakota business and industry the rate increases will be significantly higher. The state has 142 rate classes or job areas. Separate rates may go down as much as 14.4 percent or up 15.6 percent. For instance, in oil well servicing the rate will go down 5.5 percent, but in water well drilling operation it will go up 15.6 percent. For concrete work it would go down 4.8 percent, and for law enforcement it would go up 5.9 percent.
Given the roller-coaster ride businesses face in dealing with WSI payments, because of the combination of basic rate and premium credits, there might be a move to monkey with the rate based on investment markets and the resulting credits, but that would create long-term problems for both the agency and business. The rate needs to be sound on its own. And the fund, which has obligations well into the future, likewise must maintain its integrity.
Gov. John Hoeven should approve the proposed WSI rate increase.",en,web
"Of the six hitters who began Saturday tied for the most strikeouts in the National League, only one seems like he does not belong. Cameron Maybin and Jordan Schafer are both talented rookies getting acclimated to major league pitching. Prince Fielder is a slugger who struck out 135 times last season. Lance Berkman was bothered early by shoulder soreness. Mark Reynolds set a single-season record in 2008 by striking out 204 times.
That leaves David Wright, who has 19 strikeouts in 63 at-bats (73 plate appearances) this season – or one every 3.84 times up. Since 2006, Wright has gradually struck out less often – once every 5.85 plate appearances in 2006 to 6.18 in 2007 to 6.24 in 2008. But Manager Jerry Manuel and the hitting coach Howard Johnson have noticed that Wright has not looked quite right at the plate. Manuel said that Wright’s swing had gotten long and that he was “traveling” – or drifting – into the pitch rather than standing back and hitting it.
“That’s an adjustment I think he can make because he’s done it before,” Manuel said. “In his best years, it didn’t look like he went anywhere, and there is the ball, right there. It’s almost – not quite – like Barry Bonds. David has to do the same thing.”
Whenever Wright tends to scuffle, as he calls it, his hands tend to take a slow, circuitous path during his swing. With a longer swing, he is vulnerable to outside pitches, and he has struck out looking at his fair share. When Wright was off to a slow start in April 2007, Keith Hernandez told me that “a pitch on the outside corner is a pitch that most hitters love, but whenever anyone slumps, it looks like it’s third down and 40. It’s so far away.”
Before Saturday’s game against the Nationals, Manuel said: “It’s difficult to get to that pitch if you’re traveling, if you know what I’m saying. You can’t put a good swing on it.”
Still, Wright began the day batting .302, so it is not as if he is at the Mendoza Line or anything, which Manuel has also noticed.
“Right now, he’s just moving slightly,” Manuel said. “That’s hitting. That’s part of the art of hitting. And the thing about it, he’s still somewhat surviving. Shows just how good he can really be.”",en,unknown
"Some stuff you can't make up. While many of us sorrow at Apple founder Steve Jobs' death, and others acknowledge Jobs' genius while also admitting that he had his flaws, Richard M. Stallman, aka rms, founder of the Free Software Foundation (FSF), stated on his blog that ""I'm not glad he's dead, but I'm glad he's gone.""
Stallman's complete posting, reads:
Steve Jobs, the pioneer of the computer as a jail made cool, designed to sever fools from their freedom, has died.
As Chicago Mayor Harold Washington said of the corrupt former Mayor Daley, ""I'm not glad he's dead, but I'm glad he's gone."" Nobody deserves to have to die - not Jobs, not Mr. Bill, not even people guilty of bigger evils than theirs. But we all deserve the end of Jobs' malign influence on people's computing.
Unfortunately, that influence continues despite his absence. We can only hope his successors, as they attempt to carry on his legacy, will be less effective.
OK, we get it that the father of free software isn't going to think anything nice about proprietary software's biggest champion, but come on! As my grandmother used to say, ""If you don't have anything good to say, then don't say anything at all.""
I'm glad to say that the vast majority of open-source developers don't agree with Stallman's myopic views. Yes, free software is important. Yes, the GPL was essential for the creation of the modern technology world which runs on such open-source projects as Linux, the Apache Web server, and the MySQL databases. But we also know that Jobs was also essential to our modern computing world. Jobs was our generation's Disney, its Edison. The bottom line is almost everyone I know in open-source circles admired Jobs. RMS is the exception not the rule.
By choosing to use the occasion of Jobs' death for one more public jab at proprietary software, Stallman did neither his personal causes nor the larger ones of free and open-source software any good.",en,web

"The plant, Kalanchoe fedtschenkoi, is unique because, unlike normal plants, it captures most of its carbon dioxide at night when the air is cooler and more humid, making it 10 times more water-efficient than major crops such as wheat. Scientists will use the latest next-generation DNA sequencing to analyse the plant's genetic code and understand how these plants function at night.
The project will generate a genome sequence database that will be used as an Internet resource for plant biologists throughout the world.
The research comes at a time when farmland across the globe normally used for growing food such as rice and wheat is being taken over by bio-fuel crops used for bioethanol production as a petrol substitute. Scientists believe that the novel genes found in Kalanchoe could provide a model of how bio-fuel plants could be grown on un-utilised desert and semi-arid lands, rather than on fertile farmland needed for producing food.
Biological scientist, Dr James Hartwell, said: ""There is a lot of concern over food shortage at the moment, with more farmland being commandeered for bio-fuels. As a result of changes in our climate the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has predicted a large expansion of arid regions so there is an increasing need for new crop varieties that can be productive in deserts.
""Kalanchoe is a good example of how plants can flourish in harsh environments. If we can understand how it is able to photosynthesise using much less water than current crops, we may be able to use its genetic code to develop a crop able to withstand harsh environmental conditions. It is essential that farmland be returned to food production.""
The genetic code of the plant will be deciphered using a DNA sequencing machine that uses an enzyme found in fireflies as a flash light to help read the DNA strand.

"Asian Double Eyelid Surgery - Effective But Controversial
Asian double eyelid surgery isn't a procedure that involves both eyelids but involves the upper eyelid only. Roughly half of all Asians, the percentage is significantly higher among Koreans, have a single upper eyelid, which is to say an eyelid that does not have a crease or a fold. The remaining Asians, and the preponderance of Caucasians and Blacks have a double upper eyelid, an eyelid with a crease.
Eyelid surgery is usually performed to remove excess skin, muscle or fat from the eyelids giving the eyes a somewhat reshaped appearance. The surgery, called blepharoplasty, is most often performed for purely cosmetic reasons, although there are cases where eyelid surgery may be performed to improve one's vision. When done for cosmetic reasons, the results can often be astounding, with the patient often taking on a much younger appearance.
Asian double eyelid surgery is almost always done for cosmetic purposes, and many who have had it done will admit that it gives them a more ""Western"" look. Insofar as Asian beauty is concerned, having a single upper eyelid is not regarded as a negative, but many Asian women, and not a few men, want to appear more attractive in the Western sense as well, and opt to have the surgery done. Most respectable surgeons, at least those in the United States, do not promote Asian double eyelid surgery as a step towards enhancing beauty, and when the procedure is performed, the goal is to retain an Asian ethnic appearance as much as possible.
More Popular In Asia - Ironically, this is not true in Asia, where Asian double eyelid surgery is becoming more and more popular and is actively encouraged. What is even more ironical perhaps, is that in the United States, the parents of ethnic Asians who have the single upper eyelid, usually encourage the operation, perhaps thinking their son or daughter will fit more comfortably into the Western culture they are living in. The children on the other hand, more often than not seem to resist the surgery, fearing it will take away from the ethnicity of which they are rightly proud. In a way, some ethnic Asian young people resent the procedure as one being an attempt to become ""more white"", just as some blacks resent other blacks who have their hair straightened or their skin lightened to become more white.
Making the Choice - If one is contemplating Asian double eyelid surgery, the cultural pros and cons will certainly come into the picture. If the person decides to go ahead, the first step is usually to visit and ophthalmologist to determine whether the eyes themselves would be negatively impacted by the surgery. The doctors performing the procedure should also be aware of any illness the patient may have, or any medications the patient is taking. There are certain diseases and disorders which, if present, could make the procedure unwise, even though it is a fairly simple operation.
Asian double eyelid surgery will normally take around 3 hours and is usually done under a general anesthetic. Recovery can be painful at first, but the healing process normally does not take long. Complications from the surgery are rather rare, but the procedure itself is somewhat risky in that any mistake that is made could affect one's vision. Costs can vary, with a typical cost running around $2,500 in the United States. A reputable surgeon on the Asian mainland will usually charge about half that amount. Taking into account airfare and the fact that planning to have an operation performed in a foreign country can sometimes be a source of anxiety, suggests that having the operation performed in your own backyard would probably be the better choice.",en,reference

"Washington U. Baseball Picks Up 20th Win of the Season, 25-13, Over St. Norbert
St. Louis, Mo., April 1, 2012 – The Washington University in St. Louis baseball team recorded 24 hits, including 10 for extra bases, as the Bears earned their 20th win of the season with a 25-13 victory over St. Norbert College on Sunday afternoon at Kelly Field.
The teams combined for 41 hits and 15 errors in the game that lasted more than three hours. Washington U. took a 10-1 lead after three innings with seven unearned runs on 10 hits and five errors by St. Norbert. The Green Knights plated three runs in the top of the fourth to cut the deficit to 10-4, but Washington U. answered with five runs on three hits and three errors in the bottom of the inning to extend the lead back to 15-4.
After St. Norbert made it 15-6 in the top of the fifth, Washington U. plated five runs on six hits in the bottom of the inning to score 20 runs (20-6) for the second time this season. The Green Knights scored the next seven runs of the game to get to within 20-13, but Washington U. added two runs in the seventh and three in the eighth to finish with the 25-13 win.
Twelve different players recorded hits in the game for the Bears, led by sophomore Kyle Billig (4-for-5, five runs, two RBIs) and senior Brandon Rogalski (3-for-5, two runs, four RBIs). Both Billig and Rogalski hit two doubles in the game. Freshman Chris Lowery also had three hits (3-for-7, two runs). Junior David Madson hit a pair of RBI triples in the game to finish 2-for-4 with three runs and two RBIs. Junior Max Gordon picked up his fourth win of the season (4-1) pitching five innings and allowing six runs, just two earned.
Washington U. (20-6) continues its 12-game homestand on Wednesday, April 4, against Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology. First pitch is scheduled for 3 p.m. at Kelly Field.
Bear Notebook: The win was the eighth in a row for Washington U. … Rogalski has now recorded 17 multiple-hit games this season … Lowery extended his team-leading hitting streak to 10 games … Rogalski’s two runs scored in the game moved him into a tie for 10th on the Washington U. all-time career list (114) … He also moved into fourth for RBIs (128) and a tie for fourth in doubles (41).",en,web

The wheels stopped turning, the engines cooled down, and the vehicles that made the cruise were detailed, shined, and judged for what would become a heated battle for a selection of highly desirable awards. Skateboard decks treated with slick airbrush, pinstripe, and leather work were up for grabs and definitely kept the contest interesting.
Need a little break from the norm? Ready to hit the road with some good people and show off your finished or in-progress build? If so, Cruise to the Pines is definitely for you.

"When it comes to public relations, everyone has their own opinion on what works and what doesn’t. Because PR isn’t pure science, it harbors many myths about what it takes to get publicity and to create a buzz for your company. I’ve come up with a brief list of 4 PR myths I hear on a regular basis. I’m sure there are far more PR myths than this, so please feel free to leave comments sharing your favorite myths.
- No such thing as bad publicity—Not a week goes by that I don’t hear this phrase uttered by someone who fancies himself a PR expert. If you don’t think there is such a thing as bad publicity, ask any of dozens of politicians who have been caught in sex or financial scandals, forcing them to resign. Or ask Michael Vick. While there are some people who are able to leverage negative publicity to their advantage (e.g. Kanye West), these are the exceptions. Bad publicity can cause irreparable damage.
- Social media can’t be used for PR—Despite the growth in popularity of Twitter and Facebook, there are still plenty of naysayers who believe social media is a complete waste of time. I feel sorry for these people. Social media is an excellent medium for PR. It allows you to create a buzz around your business and to build relationships with your target audience. But be careful: Many have shot themselves in the foot with social media. Just flip over to ESPN and it won’t take long for you to hear a story about another athlete getting in trouble for something stupid they Tweeted.
- You need to have a gimmick to get attention—Too many people believe you need to pull off a major PR stunt to get attention. Remember the balloon boy story from just a few weeks ago? Those nutjobs thought pulling this hoax would land them a reality show. Granted, maybe it will…after they serve time in jail. Gimmicks are generally a bad idea for few reasons: 1)Any attention is usually very short lived; 2)The gimmick almost always distracts from your main message; 3) Gimmicks appear desperate and unprofessional.
- Major media is all that matters—Everyone wants to be the next major story on Oprah, or they want to get interviewed on CNN. Many people think small media is a waste of time. It’s not. Getting coverage in a small magazine, on a podcast, a blog, or on a local TV show is an essential first step for getting the larger coverage you desire. In many cases, media coverage from smaller outlets can also help you more accurately reach your target audience too.

"By Matt Snyder
Another season gone, another disappointment for 29 teams as one is immortalized forever -- this time around it's the St. Louis Cardinals. Let’s take a look back at 2011 and forward in Eye on Baseball’s R.I.P. series...
Team name: St. Louis Cardinals
Record: 90-72, 2nd place in NL Central, NL wild card winner. Won NLDS 3-2 over Phillies, won NLCS 4-2 over Brewers, won World Series over Rangers 4-3.
Manager: Tony La Russa
Best hitter: Albert Pujols -- .299/.366/.541, 37 HR, 99 RBI, 105 R, 9 SB
Best pitcher: Chris Carpenter -- 11-9, 3.45 ERA, 1.26 WHIP, 191 K, 237.1 IP
2011 SEASON RECAP
The Cardinals entered the spring as the favorite in the wide-open NL Central, but nearly immediately lost ace Adam Wainwright to a torn ulnar-collateral ligament. So he underwent Tommy John surgery and the Cardinals were largely written off as a serious threat to the Brewers and the defending division champion Reds. A 2-6 start didn't help matters, especially with Matt Holliday having to undergo an appendectomy. Oh, and Pujols was struggling out of the gate. But a change at the back-end of the bullpen and Lance Berkman's re-emergence as a big-time slugger helped straighten things out. By the end of April, the Cardinals were 16-11 and in first place. A bad June and mediocre July weren't enough to bury the Cardinals, but the Brewers huge surge in August seemed to end the postseason hopes for St. Louis. There was no catching Milwaukee. The Cardinals finished 23-9 and ran down the Braves in the wild card, advancing into the playoffs when the Braves lost in extra innings on the final day of the regular season. The fun times extended all the way until the World Series, as the Cardinals took down by the Phillies and Brewers en route to their 18th NL championship. An insane comeback in Game 6 of the World Series paved the way for the Cardinals 11th World Championship.
Yadier Molina, C (club option)
Gerald Laird, C
Albert Pujols, 1B
Rafael Furcal, SS (club option)
Nick Punto, IF utility
Corey Patterson, OF
Edwin Jackson, SP
Arthur Rhodes (club option)
Octavio Dotel (club option)
Everything boils down to what happens with Pujols. If the Cardinals can re-sign him, they'll have essentially the same team in 2012 as they had in 2011, but with a healthy Adam Wainwright taking Edwin Jackson's vacated spot in the rotation -- there's no way they'll have enough money to keep Jackson after extending Berkman and Carpenter while keeping Pujols, Wainwright and Molina. Obviously, if the Cardinals do come back with a similar team and Wainwright is healthy you can expect them to once again be a big-time playoff contender.
The biggest focus will be to retain Pujols and I firmly believe they will. What they have to do in order to get him to stay dictates flexibility elsewhere, but most of the biggest questions have already been answered. Carpenter, Berkman and Wainwright are locked up. Holliday already was. It actually seems like a sound strategy. Instead of taking maybe a few months to get Pujols' deal done and then trying to pick up the spare parts, the Cardinals know their budget and what their roster will look like around Pujols. It's one of the many reasons I believe they'll get him. There's obviously a plan in place.
- Molina's option should and will be picked up.
- There's not going to be enough money left to do much in the middle infield. They likely can't afford to pick up Furcal's option, so it's going to be some combination of Ryan Theriot, Skip Schumaker and Daniel Descalso, which is serviceable considering the strength of the rest of the lineup. Maybe they get Furcal to come back on a cheap one-year deal? He reportedly wants to stay and it's not like his value is sky-high.
- David Freese (3B) and Jon Jay (CF) are going to be the everyday players all season, and both are plenty adequate in their current roles -- especially postseason hero Freese. Jason Motte will also be the full-time closer all season after showing he can do the job down the stretch. These are all full-season upgrades.
- Keep an eye on Shelby Miller. Jake Westbrook is only going to be a bridge to when Miller can join the rotation. The 20-year-old right-hander was 9-3 with a 2.70 ERA and 89 strikeouts in 86 2/3 Double-A innings this season. It's very possible he's ready to get a shot by June or July. And maybe the Cardinals even plug Lance Lynn in the rotation instead of Westbrook at some point anyway. Expect Lynn to be used as insurance for injury issues -- or even to save Wainwright's arm a bit -- early in the season.
- If Pujols doesn't re-sign, the possibilities are nearly endless. They'll have a chunk of money to play with an a desperate need to upgrade the offense. Maybe go after Jose Reyes to set the table for Holliday, Berkman and Freese? The non-signing of Pujols is a bridge we'll cross if it actually happens, because at this point I just don't see him not going back to St. Louis.",en,web

"Dear E. Jean: Im a political science undergraduate in my final year. To help pay for my education, I took part in various awkward arrangements with a string of sugar daddies. These men distracted me from accomplishing anything worthwhile. Worse, they made me feel inept. It was difficult, but I managed to end my easy-money addiction and rededicate myself to my studies.
he reason Im writing? The political campaigns have fired my imagination like nothing else! Ive been working as an intern for a senator and have now decided to make politics my career. But Im terrified that somewhere along the line someone will find out what I spent my first two years of college doing. I have absolutely no justification for the shallow and disgusting things I did! So, my question: Am I wasting my time? Should I continue to forge a career in politics or switch now to avert a calamity later? Possibly Paranoid
Possibly, My Innocent Parsnip: You want to enter politics? Heres the law: You may invade a country, hide billions in secret accounts in the Caymans, con, scam, sneak, steal, lie, and possess the brain of a pea, but, whatever you do, dont boff a sugar daddy.
Since, however, you have boffed a sugar daddy, the best advice I can give you is this: Publish an autobiography detailing your rolls in the halls of academe. If you write it well, tell the truth, and make a clean breast of itthe whole breast, and nothing but the breastthen you may have a slim chance (slimmer than Governor Chris Christie) of clearing your way into politics.
President Obama, in Dreams From My Father, described his high-school junkie and pothead days in such swashbuckling Hunter Thompsonesque terms that his opponents wished they had been stoners and written their own books.
But lets not get ahead of ourselves. Im reminded of a young lady who wrote to me 15 or 16 years ago. She was worried her husband would leave her when she appeared on David Letterman to talk about her new book. How will my husband deal with my sudden fame? she asked.
How exciting, I wrote back. Whens your book coming out?
Oh, she replied. I havent written it yet.
Winning the internship with the senator shows you have brainsgood. Now lets find out if you possess the manic drive, impertinence, and acting ability to forge a career in politics. Take this simple aptitude test: You have one semester to persuade your student government to pass a law banning all guns within a two-mile radius of campus. (Or a law permitting all gunswhichever principle you wish to see ground beneath the boots of the special interests.) The National Rifle Association, your state legislature, and your college administration will express themselves accordingly. If you get the law passed, then write to me about entering politics.

"Kevin Liles-US PRESSWIRE
We are taking a look at Mel Kiper's top 5 players at every position of need for the Eagles. For the rest of this series, check out our storystream.
If the Eagles do make the switch to a 3-4, as it seems all but certain they will, there will need to be some personnel changes in the front 7. One of the most crucial areas will be at outside linebacker.
So let's take a look at Mel Kiper's top 5 OLBs in the 2013 draft.
|2||Jamie Collins||Southern Miss||6-3||239|
|5||Arthur Brown||Kansas State||6-1||228|
Here's his overall take on the class.
Jones is a star -- no way around it. Greene isn't really a pure pass-rushing type; he's the kind of guy who's going to make 150 tackles for an NFL team at some point, likely working from the weak side. I think other smaller linebackers will limit the size questions.
Jarvis Jones - Sick production as a pass rusher while also being solid against the run. Had 13.5 sacks in 2011 and 14.5 in 2012. He also had 24.5 tackles for a loss. Has the physical tools for the position and is a natural leader. Mel Kiper has him rated as his #1 overall player in the 2013 draft.
The big, maybe the only concern about Jones is medical. I'll let our pals at Gang Green Nation explain.
Jones' biggest negative is his medical status. He has a condition known as ""spinal stenosis."" This is the same condition that forced Cooper Manning (Eli and Peyton Manning's brother) to retire from football, in addition to Marcus McNeill and Michael Irvin. I've consulted with a doctor regarding spinal stenosis, and although he hasn't inspected Jones' personally, he gave me some insight into the disorder, generally. Spinal stenosis is the narrowing of the spinal column where the nerves come through it at the bottom. It is a degenerative disease, so it could get worse progressively and he may never have a problem during his playing career, or it could degenerate quickly and force him to retire at a young age. With stenosis, Jones is more at-risk for paralysis than other players, especially because he plays such a physical position. In fact, USC refused to clear him to play, which is why he transferred to UGA. Jones' medical status is such a huge concern that he will likely rapidly tumble down the draft board once teams see his medical information come the NFL Combine.
While the disease hasn't really been an issue for Jones, it is certainly something that is important for NFL teams to consider. Last year, Matt Kalil got just under $20 million fully guaranteed over 4 years as the #4 pick. That's a pretty major investment the Eagles are going to have to make, so they'll need to be fully aware of the risks. They'll get a chance to get more medical information at the combine.
Jamie Collins - Interesting guy that actually came to college as a defensive back, but moved to linebacker. CBS sports compares him to KJ Wright of the Seahawks.
Muscular, athletic-looking frame with powerful hands and long arms. Accelerates well in a straight line, and exhibits good flexibility, both coming off the edge as a rusher, as well as when changing direction in space. Displays a knack for getting to the quarterback off the edge, with impressive natural power on contact, and ability to disengage when he uses his hands effectively. Flashes a strong, sudden closing burst in space. Appears natural and comfortable in his lower half when asked to drop into zone coverage. When he gets his arms extended at the point of attack, can really manhandle his blocker. Doesn't possess a ton of short-area burst when breaking down to make tackles in space, but uses length nicely to compensate.
Khaseem Greene - Another athletic guy that switched from safety to LB in college. Can matchup with TEs and RB in the pass game and has good range, but probably a better fit in a 4-3.
Chase Thomas - Not an elite pass rusher like Jones, but certainly capable in that area. Extremely high effort guy who was productive at Standford. There are questions about his athleticism, so the combine will be big for him.
Arthur Brown - Happens to be the older brother of Eagles RB Bryce Brown. Is very athletic and shows good range against the run. Very productive and capable against the both pass and the run, but is undersized. Probably needs to be a WILL in a 4-3. Really talented guy though.",en,reference
"Frequently Asked Questions About Health Savings Accounts
Health savings accounts are special types of savings accounts that have tax advantages and that can be used to cover the costs of medical treatment. If you are considering a health savings account, the following answers to some frequently asked questions can help you to make a decision about whether a health savings account is right for you.
What is a health savings account? A health savings account, or HSA, is a savings account that is set aside to cover medical expenses. The account is considered a tax deferred account, which means the government effectively subsidizes the amount of money that you invest by allowing you to avoid taxes on it.
How Does a Health Savings Account Work? Many people purchase high deductible Texas insurance plans because they are an affordable way to buy Texas health insurance. A high deductible plan might, for example, cover medical costs once you have spent $5,000 over the course of a year on your own medical expenses. Because these high deductible plans kick in only after you’ve already spent a lot of money (the deductible), they are often called catastrophic coverage plans. They protect you from huge health care expenses that would cripple you financially, while leaving the small costs to you.
A health savings account (HSA), allows you to put aside the money for the deductible so that you can pay for the healthcare costs you incur with pre-tax dollars. For example, if you had a $5,000 deductible, you could put $5,000 in your HSA. When you had qualifying medical expenses such as dental care, vision care, doctor’s visits, or prescription drugs to buy, you would pay for them with money out of your health savings account. Essentially, then, you’d get your medical care at a discount.
To open a qualifying HSA and enjoy the tax benefits of buying your medical care with pre-tax dollars, you must have a qualifying high deductible health plan. You must also open your account at a bank or savings institution that has been qualified by the IRS as an “HSA Custodian.” Most major banks qualify.
Can I see any healthcare provider I want? Typically, if you have an HSA policy, you will have a network of providers called preferred providers. This is because these policies are normally Preferred Provider Organizations. You can go to any “in-network” physician to receive a substantial discount on your medical costs. You can also go to out-of-network physicians but you’ll pay more.
What if I reach my deductible? If you reach the deductible on the policy by spending the full amount within a one year period, your insurance carrier will pay the balance of your medical costs up to policy limits. The terms of your HSA policy will explain what percentage of the medical costs are paid. With most HSA’s, the portion paid by the insurer once you reach your deductible is 100 percent.
What if I don’t spend all of the money in my HSA? If you do not spend the full amount saved in your HSA, the money is yours to keep. You can continue to keep it in the account and, in some cases, you can even invest it in mutual funds, stocks, and bonds. The flexibility of the HSA accounts is one of the reasons why many people opt for an HSA policy for their Texas health insurance.",en,reference
"We all have gifts. Some of the are physical gifts like the ability to throw a baseball at 90 mph, and some of them are mental, like curing some rare illness. But what of our spiritual gifts? The greatest sports figures spend hours honing their craft so they can be the best at whatever it is. Some of us spend hours on the golf course working on our drive or on out putt, some of us need to spend more time doing that! The great thinkers of the world, and yes they still exists, spend hours upon hours just thinking about things and trying to find out how things work. So again I ask, what of our spiritual gifts?
In his first Epistle, St. Peter writes, “… you also, living stones, are being built upon a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.” He is speaking about all of us; we are all priests and take part in the Royal Priesthood of Jesus Christ. Our job is to offer up spiritual sacrifices that will become acceptable to God. We all have a part to play in the ministry of the Church the task before us is to find what the role is.
In today’s Epistle to the Ephesians, St. Paul writes that, “He Himself gave some to be apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, and some pastors and teachers.” He lays out the roles in the Church, for leaders in the Church, and for the regular folk as well. He goes on to say that this is done for the, “equipping of the saints for the work of ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ.” Just as St. Peter pointed out, so now St. Paul points out.
On the day of our Chrismation, when the Holy spirit came upon us, and confirmed our call to be a child of God, we were given gifts. We all have them we just need to find what they are. This can be a most difficult task, to discern what gifts we have and what our place should be in the Church. We have to actively seek out what these gifts are. We seek these gifts through prayer and direction from those who have come before us. We are charged with “equipping the saints” and in order to do that we need to be equipped ourselves.
In the Church we often speak of the three T’s; Time, Talent, and Treasure, well we often speak of the treasure one more than the others, and that is something we need to change. We cannot focus all of our time and energy on money, we cannot continue to build larger barns to store our treasure in if we have no one to share it with!
We have not often spoken about the Biblical concept of tithing. This is the concept that Jesus often speaks of, and the Apostles take it up from Him, where we are commanded to give 10 percent, off the top, of our time, talent, and treasure to God. Again this gets skewed toward the treasure part and we forget about the others.
Time, time is something that most people do not seem to have enough of. In the olden days it seemed there was much more time to things. The founders of this Church, for example, would work long hard days and then come there and build the Church. They would spend hours here physically building the Church after working very physically demanding jobs. When the Church was open, they would be here. Many of you have told me stories of being dragged here for some service or another. They made time for what was important.
Are there less hours in the day today then there were when the founders were here? Did the calendar somehow change and make less than 24 hours in the day or 365 days in the year? There must be since we seem to run out of time. They concentrated on what was important.
A recent survey showed that people who attend church on a regular basis spend less than one percent of their time engaged in some sort of spiritual matters. I am not just talking about coming to church, but on any spiritual matters. In the course of the seven days of the week, there are 168 hours. If we come to church each Sunday, then we spend approximately 2 of those 168 hours in Church. Now I am not that great at math but that would seem like less than ten percent. We spend more time eating then we do on spiritual matters!
Are you giving 10 percent of your time to God?
Talent, talent can be looked at the same way as time. What talents do you have and are you giving ten percent of them to God? Not just paying them lip service, but really and truly giving them to God. The basic talent that all Christians have is the ability to pray, this ties in with time by the way. If we spent ten percent of the day in prayer imagine what this world, and our lives, would be like. Each week I put names in the bulletin of people who are on our prayer list. Not a day goes by that I do not get asked to pray for someone, either by one of you, a friend of mine, or on the email. Part of our daily prayer time, and I hope we all have a daily prayer time, should be spent praying for people by name. Praying for people is something we call can do, it requires no special skills at all. But what of other talents that we might have, are we using them to build the kingdom of God?
Are you giving 10 percent of your talent to God?
Treasure, we have spoken of this many times before. We all give, what we can, out of what we have, to God through the Church. The reality is we need money to keep the doors open and it is not getting any cheaper to do so. But we cannot simply focus on this aspect of the 3 T’s we need a balance approach to our spiritual lives. Remember, it is not “well I give 10% of my income to the church so I am good.” No, we are required to give ten percent of the 3 T’s not just one or two but all three.
The goal of our spiritual life is to enable us to uncover and unlock our potential. On the day of our Chrismation we were placed on the road that should enable us to do just that, discover our potential and then chart the course to unlock that and put it into action. What good is something if we never use it for what it is intended to be used for?
God has given us all gifts, God has given us all talents, and God has given us all treasure. The time has come that we all unlock the potential that we all have and put it to use for the building of the kingdom. The founders left us a physical home of brick and mortar, now we have to build the spiritual home or prayer and worship.",en,books
"Gold Coast Suns hold all the aces
Suns captain Garry Ablett following the AFL Round 22 match between the Gold Coast Suns and the Carlton Blues (Photo: Patrick Hamilton/AFL Media)
As the Gold Coast Suns tuck into another round of off-season beverages, the club’s recruiting manager Scott Clayton has earned the right to rip the top off a few cold ones of his own.
After all, it is his groundwork that has laid the foundation for not only the expansion side’s expected tilt at finals football over the next five years, but beyond.
Indeed, the Coast has a list so overflowing with talent that when the trade period rolls around at the conclusion of this finals series, or any for the next little bit, they will hold all the aces.
If they want Kurt Tippett, they have the bait to get him.
If another club needs an injection of promise or youth in any position, Carrara should be their first port of call.
It means that Gold Coast can start planning for a decade from now, when Gary Ablett will be long retired, David Swallow will be wily and experienced and Harley Bennell will make the Cyril years feel like a bygone era.
This all goes back to Clayton’s work, and his reluctance to take on more experienced players when the Suns had the chance.
After copping the short-term pain, the triple-figure floggings and the criticism, the rewards from this policy are starting to emerge on the horizon.
The expansion caper has never been done like this, with a bunch of teenagers thrown together at a pop-up club in a region barely touched by the game – so it’s been incredibly hard to predict how all of this was going to unfold.
But now, we can confidently say that the Suns are on the right track following a rollercoaster two-year initiation into the AFL.
It’s been difficult trying to figure out what bits of their first two seasons were down to the inconsistency of young players, and what parts were a result of errors in planning, list management or coaching.
If year one was a pass mark, then the first half of year two was an utter disaster that prompted many scribes – this one included – to question if this was really the right way to go about promoting the game in a new market, or building a new team from scratch.
The answer soon came. From Round 12 onwards, Gold Coast ironed out most of the creases and staged a resurgence that peeled back the curtain on what we can expect from them on a consistent basis going forward.
In the face of an extraordinary injury crisis, they unearthed a list that will, in time, be one of the best in the competition.
The Suns could not be better placed for the future. The deadwood of the first two years is being cleared out, and what’s left is rolled gold talent.
Gold Coast has it all.
A selection of young, spritely forwards all with the potential to follow Tom Hawkins’ example and slowly progress into the elite ranks.
A midfield that, even compensating for the forthcoming loss of hard-working, silky-smooth Josh Caddy, is equal parts grit and glitter.
A ruck division containing one of the competition’s brightest prospects, and a selection of other beanpoles that are now well on their way to filling out and becoming bonafide AFL players.
A rearguard that has grasped a new modern defensive structure, and has coupled that with natural poise and pace on the rebound to support the other areas of the ground.
The vast majority of Gold Coast’s first premiership side is almost certainly on their books at this very moment.
But the ones that won’t make it? Indeed, if there is a problem, then it’s that they just have too much talent. Not all of it can fit into a side of 22, and other sides will profit.
For example, Steven May, Sam Day and Tom Lynch can’t all play in the same forward line, especially not if Kurt Tippett joins them.
This isn’t so much a problem, though, as a blessing.
It’s not ideal that Caddy wants to move back to Victoria, especially after the Suns stuck with him after an injury-plagued first season. But they’ll get a first round pick for him at minimum.
That’ll be used to grab another young player. Three or four years down the track, he’ll come good at a time when guys like Dion Prestia and Brandon Matera have made names for themselves after 100 hard-nosed games.
Josh Toy is another who will head home. He hasn’t lived up to the hype, but he’s still worth a fair bit on the open market – in return, Gold Coast will get another draftee brimming with promise, who will head to the back of the queue.
When one of the three tall forwards wants out, or any other player with trade value does, the same will happen again.
This is what they mean when they say that the AFL has created a monster with the expansion sides.
Not that they’re going to be so awesome now, or even in five years time – but they’re poised for a long stretch at the top. GWS can’t be far behind.
Think conveyor belt, not premiership window. The idea is to have it open all the time.
When will it start? Who knows. That’s Guy McKenna’s problem. But now that the rough part’s out of the way, it’ll be fun to watch.
Vince Rugari is an Adelaide-born journalist who cut his teeth on the sporting graveyard that is the Gold Coast. He fancies the round ball and the Sherrin, and used to be a handy leg-spin bowler before injury curtailed a baggy green push. He is a Port Adelaide fan by birth, as painful as that has been recently. He's now sports editor of The Area News in Griffith, NSW.

"Watch out world, here comes the newest graduate. My pagumankon (niece) has graduated. Two years ago she received her two year Associates Degree. Now, two years later, she has completed and passed the entire four year program earning her a Bachelor’s Degree! The first in our family to do so! The degree is in computer science by the way, one of the most challenging courses. I am so very, very proud of her and am also proud to announce to the world her accomplishment. She has set an example, not only for her family, but also for all young women everywhere that if you put your mind to it you can achieve success.
How did she do this? First she had a dream. She dared to dream that she could earn a degree. Then she believed in that dream. She was willing to make the sacrifices needed to realize that dream. She had no idea how she would pay for all this but she set out in faith that all would come together. With a little financial help she was on her way. There were struggles along the way of course. Like the time she was hospitalized and had to spend her school money to save her life. That didn’t stop her though. She kept on going. Finally, on April 15th 2012, she happily received her degree. Accomplishments like this don’t come easy but she was tough enough to see it through. That’s why I say “watch out world”. I have all the confidence in the world that this young woman is going to accomplish even more great things in her life.
Here she is, Ma. Cristina M. Ligaray. Our graduate.
Doesn’t she look gwapa? That’s because she is. There’s nothing more I can say then that I am extremely proud of her. Cristina, you go girl!
Here they come! Run for the hills! Don’t even take time to pack your luggage, just get to running and whatever you do don’t look back, the buad are here!
Okay, okay, it’s not quite as bad as that but buad is definitely something that takes getting used to. Buad is the Bisayan term and it is called “Tuyo” in Tagalog and is a small, dried, salted fish. The fish itself is no problem and is actually quite tasty when cooked. However it is the aroma (odor, lol) that comes during and after cooking. That’s when you want to run and run and run and run as far away as you can. That is if you are a Westerner. The odor seems to have no effect on the Pinoy or Pinay cooking and eating it. In fact it is a favorite for many Pilipinos who are living and/or working abroad as it reminds them of home. Every one who makes a Balikbayan trip back to the Philippines always brings back plenty of buad/tuyo to share with their kababayan (countrymen) upon their return to their western country. Buad or tuyo is really the food of the poor people in the Philippines and many are happy to have it as otherwise they would have nothing to eat. Sad but true. Even so all Pilipinos enjoy it and those in western countries look forward to it as a special treat.
How to describe the, ahem, aroma? It’s difficult. For the ultimate answer you must experience it yourself. In the meantime, let me relate my story. The first time I stayed in Cebu City I was in a hotel right off Colon Street. Thinking I wanted to acclimate myself to the weather there I turned off the air conditioning in my hotel room and opened the window. Big mistake as that’s when it hit me. I remember thinking, “Wow. Someone must have been dumping their garbage outside the hotel and now it has turned rotten.” I swear, it was terrible. I was forced to close the window. I later learned that the cause of this odor was the restaurant across the street that was cooking buad. I have since become a little bit more used to it but doubt that I will ever fully embrace it. It’s truly quite an experience for my western nose.
Here is what to look for so you can prepare yourself. If you see the following then get the clothespins out and clip one to your nose.
Here is the buad/tuyo section from the SeaFood City grocery store in Sacramento, CA;
I was about to compose a post for Pasko (Christmas) but as many of you may know tragedy has struck our beloved Philippines. Typhoon Sendong (also called Typhoon Washi) has slammed into Northern Mindanao causing massive flooding. At the time it passed over Cagayan de Oro City and Iligan City, the sites of the greatest devastation, it had already been downgraded to a tropical storm. Unfortunately in this part of the Philippines it is extremely rare for a typhoon to strike and as a result many of the people were unprepared. To further complicate matters the storm roared in at night while most were sleeping. Whole families were washed away as they lay in their beds. At this point in time there are an estimated 650+ who have lost their lives and another 800+ unaccounted for with the most loss of life occurring in the two cities. However, these are only estimates and the actual loss of life may be much higher, especially when they begin to search the outlying areas of the provinces. Other provinces also experienced the wrath of Sendong throughout the Visayas and Palawan.
This is a time when we need to offer our prayers for those who have suffered the loss of family members, loved ones, friends and neighbors. It’s also a time for us all to come together and help. Help with the basics that are needed by the survivors as well as the restoration of the areas devastated. Much, much work will need to be done in the future but if I have learned one thing it is to never underestimate the resilience of the Pilipino people. When others would give up and turn back the Pilipino will press on with life and find a way to overcome. However a helping hand is always welcome. If so inclined, give what you can to help these victims of nature to recover. You can help right now by clicking on the link below to the Philippine Red Cross. God Bless.
The holidays are almost upon us. This time of year is not only for holiday observances but it’s also the time of year that many people like to vacation. Let’s face it, most of the US, Canada and Europe has dull, grey skies, rain, snow, ice and cold to freezing temperatures. Time to get away! Only question is where to?
This year, why not choose the Philippines? Warm temperatures, sunny skies, beautiful beaches, wonderful people. That’s enough to satisfy most. Want more? How about mountains with rice terraces that are thousands of years old? You’ll find them in the Philippines. Or you could visit someplace like Vigan, which is a World Heritage Site. Go to the Hundred Islands for a great time at the beach. Tour Manila and it’s surroundings like Intramuros, the old city from the Spanish colonial days. Take in the sights of Ocean Park with your family. Dine in a restaurant while you watch the sun set over Manila Bay. Breathtaking! Visit World War II historical sites like Corregidor Island. Walk along the path of the Bataan Death March and pay homage to those vets who were imprisoned and lost their lives. Visit Cabanatuan the site of the prisoner of war camp featured in the movie “Great Escape”. Over in the Bicol region you’ll see Mt. Mayon volcano which is said to have a perfect cone. Do you see where I’m going with this? All these activities are on the Island of Luzon and that is only one island out of 7,107!
Go to Cebu and see the Santo Nino. Visit the actual spot where Lapu Lapu slew Magellan then dine next door at Sutokil. Visit the world class resorts that line Mactan Island Cebu. Go up to Tops Cebu for breathtaking views. How about Moalboal for great diving? While there take in Kawasan Falls as well. Take the fast boat to Bohol and see the Chocolate Mountains. Have a nice dinner on a river cruise. See the tarsiers, tiny little monkeys measuring only 4-6 inches long (10-15 cm) with big adorable eyes. You’ll only find them in the islands of Southeast Asia. Indulge yourself and spend some time at one of the great resorts on Alona Beach. Travel over to Negros Oriental where you can find more great diving around Apo Island. Speaking of Apo, hop a quick flight down to Davao and climb Mt. Apo the highest mountain in the Philippines. Jump on over to Leyte Island and visit MacArthur’s 1944 landing spot where he fulfilled his “I shall return” promise.
Don’t forget the people of the Philippines either. While the country has great sights to see and many things to do, what makes it all so endearing are it’s people. Always hospitable, always courteous, always generous, always warm and loving, always smiling. It’s why I often call it the “Land of Smiles”.
Wow! I’m out of breath and there’s so much more to this great country. Where’s my favorite place? I have a friend in Amlan, Negros Oriental who swears that’s the best place. Another likes Cebu. Another loves Ilocos. Some say the Makati area of Manila. My favorite? Anywhere. As long as I’m in the Philippines then I’m in my favorite place.
Now back to the original question. What’s a good choice for a vacation? I encourage you, Choose Philippines! If all of the above is not enough then watch this short video for even more reasons to “Piliiin Mo Ang Pilipinas” (Choose Philippines). My thanks to the Philippines Department of Tourism and ABS-CBN network for producing this beautiful and informative video. The video features Pilipino singing stars Angeline Quinto and Vince Bueno, the song was written by Robert Labayen, vice president of ABS-CBN’s Creative Communications Management.
Although she did not walk away with the crown and the title of Miss Universe 2011 (Hellooooo Lea Salonga!!) Shamcey Supsup still shines like the brightest star in the sky. Shamcey, a Bisayan who’s hometown is General Santos City, finished in 4th place as 3rd runner up in the recent pageant but she places first in life. Binibining Supsup, graduated magna cum laude from UP Diliman located in Quezon City, Philippines. Cum laude is a Latin phrase meaning with honors, magna cum laude means with “high” honors. An accomplishment this young woman can be proud of throughout her life. Back in 2009 when she stood for the Architecture Licensure Examination she not only passed but she passed with the highest score! Smart? Yes, she is utokan kaayo (very smart). Shamcey is an inspiration to young girls and women everywhere who dream of achieving success in the world. What a tremendous example she has set. She’s a winner in my book. All that’s left to say is “Shamcey, you go girl!”.
This blog started with one of my trips to the Philippines, specifically the islands of Cebu and Negros. I want to share with you the splendors and wonders of Republika ng Pilipinas (RP) as well as the love for and from her many peoples. I hope you will enjoy my adventures and misadventures as well as the fotos that I upload here. Perhaps you will also be motivated to visit and enjoy the 7,107 islands that are the RP.

"Feb. 14, 2009
ANNAPOLIS, Md. -- Chris Harris scored 28 points and Kaleo Kina narrowly missed a triple-double with 18 points, nine assists and eight rebounds as the Navy men's basketball team cruised to a 90-67 win over Lafayette on Saturday night at Alumni Hall. The win moves Navy's record to 17-8 overall and 6-4 in the Patriot League, while Lafayette fell to 6-19 overall and 2-8 in league play.
The win allows Navy to remain in third place in the league standings and, coupled with the other league results, moved the Mids a game-and-a-half ahead of Colgate and two games ahead of the Raiders in the loss column.
In addition, Navy's 23-point victory was the largest against a Patriot League opponent since an 89-53 win over Lehigh on Feb. 23, 2000, and the 17 wins are the most during the Billy Lange era.
""I think we are a good team and the guys are confident in themselves and that was a good win tonight,"" said head coach Billy Lange. ""Lafayette is a dangerous team to play against and I felt we were focused for a good portion of this game.
""These guys want to win so much, almost too much. They want to win for each other, for the Academy, for the history of the program and for the future. I think when you look back at the great Bucknell and Holy Cross teams of the past couple of years, that is the standard they are holding to themselves,"" said Lange. ""What we told them is that we have to run our own journey. I think we have established ourselves as an upper-echelon team, but in the pursuit of perfection, you learn from your imperfections and we learned from Wednesday night, and played very focused tonight. I am excited and very confident in this group as we go into the stretch run.""
After a see-saw first six-plus minute of the game and a 20-18 Navy lead, the Mids blew the game open with an 11-0 run over 2:23 to take a 31-18 cushion with 10:08 to play. The Mids would expand the lead, taking a 48-32 advantage with 2:08 to play before settling in for a 50-35 halftime cushion.
The Leopards would cut the lead to 12 at 51-39 with 17:27 to play, but the Midshipmen embarked on another 11-0 run to take a 23-point lead at 62-39 with 14:56 to play.
Lafayette would get no closer than 17 (84-67) points the rest of the way as the Mids posted its second-most lopsided win of the season, 90-67.
Harris led the Mids with 28 points connecting on 11-of-18 field goal attempts and 4-of-9 three-point tries. The junior guard added five rebounds, three assists and three steals as he moved into 21st place on the career scoring list with 936 points. His four three-pointers gave him 76 for the season, pushing him into a second-place tie with Greg Sprink and Michael Heary for three-pointers in a season, behind just his 91 treys a year ago.
""I got good looks tonight, because we moved on offense,"" said Harris. ""Our flow was great. We were moving the ball and our spacing was great, so it opened up a lot for our offense.""
Meanwhile, for the second time in three games, Kaleo Kina nearly recorded a triple-double with 18 points, a season-high nine assists and eight rebounds. Two games ago against Bucknell, Kina tallied 17 points with 10 rebounds and seven assists. In the last three games, Kina is averaging 13.3 ppg, 7.3 rpg and 7.0 apg, while having just seven turnovers.
""Kaleo is tremendous, but again this is his journey,"" said Lange. ""Kaleo and I talked at length yesterday that this is it for him and how far he and the team has come. He is enjoying it. This is the end of the journey and this is where you leave your legacy. He came out tonight and he was phenomenal. His defense was great. It was everything.""
Clif Colbert also added a season-high 19 points (7-of-10 shooting) with six rebounds. O.J. Avworo had eight points, six assists, four rebounds and three steals.
The Mids shot 35-of-70 (.500) from the field and were 9-of-20 (.450) from three-point range and 11-of-13 (.846) from the free throw line. Navy recorded a season-best 22 assists and had 17 turnovers while outrebounding the Leopards, 44-34.
Lafayette shot 21-of-62 (.339) from the field and was 11-of-35 (.314) from the three-point line. The Leopards were 14-of-15 (.933) from the free throw line and had 21 turnovers. The Mids outscored the Leopards, 31-6, off turnovers and had 19 fast-break points to Lafayette's five.
Michael Gruner led the Leopards with 15 points, while Ryan Willen had 14 points and 12 rebounds. Andrew Brown, who had 20 in the teams' first meeting, managed just six points on 2-of-10 shooting.
""Chris (Harris) did an unbelievable job on Andrew Brown (Lafayette's leading scorer). I thought our defense was very good,"" said Lange. ""We got out and ran the floor and got good looks, rebounded and defended. That is who we are, and that is the key to our success.""
Navy will head north for a Wednesday night contest at Holy Cross, beginning at 7:00 pm in Worcester, Mass. The Crusaders are in second place in the league standings with an 8-2 record.

"Profile Therapeutics of the UK has been granted approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for Prodose, its nebuliser system that can improve the delivery of inhaled drugs.
Prodose is already launched in Europe to deliver Promixin (colistimethate sodium), an inhaled antibiotic for treatment of patients with cystic fibrosis, and Ventavis (iloprost), Schering's product for pulmonary hypertension. It has also been selected by CoTherix of the US for development of their inhaled iloprost product for pulmonary hypertension.
Profile's nebulisers are claimed to offer significant advantages over current delivery technologies, including more accurate and flexible dosing and improved patient compliance. For example, in the case of the asthma drug albuterol, the volume of drug required for nebulisation is reduced from 3ml to 0.7ml using the ProDose technology.
Prodose is Profile's second-generation Adaptive Aerosol Delivery (AAD) system. The third generation system, Prodose HandHeld, is in its final stages of development and planned to be available to patients for the first time later this year, according to the company.
This system is arguably the most commercially important of Profile's products, as it could extend the use of the technology into a much wider patient population by delivering drugs usually administered using a metered dose inhaler. Last year, Profile forged an alliance with Breath of the US to develop ProDose Handheld versions of some mainstay respiratory drugs, including albuterol, ipratropium bromide and an unnamed corticosteroid, which are due to roll out in 2004 or 2005.
M&A discussions ongoing
Meanwhile, it was reported in March that Profile was in discussions, which may or may not lead to a formal offer being made for the company. Profile has now confirmed that these discussions are ongoing and further announcements will be made in due course.",en,web

"Cold Snap and a Sick Horse
In winter, I’m grateful for small things: a steaming mug of coffee; warm, dry socks; a plowed path to the manure pile. Here in north-central Vermont, it seems too much to ask that the water not freeze in the horses’ buckets in the barn by morning, or that the truck turn over without complaint on the first try.
Last week we had a cold snap. A friend driving by on Stagecoach Road stopped in to say that as he was passing our place, his car’s outside thermometer registered lower than it ever had: -36° Fahrenheit. Our house and the adjacent veterinary clinic lie in a low valley flanked by two rivers, with mountain ranges east and west. On clear winter nights, the cold settles deeply around us.
These cold snaps don’t usually last long, but four or five days of temperatures well below zero strain both mechanical and organic things. Bolts refuse to turn, keys break, pipes burst, conversations are truncated. My husband, Gregg, and I arise to set about our daily chores with resignation and little discussion. Everything is an effort.
Even the barn chores take longer. Manure freezes hard onto stall floors, and we have to whack it with a shovel to pry it loose. We keep a pickax next to the shavings pile to break the frozen sawdust into manageable chunks. We keep a hair dryer in the barn on a hook above the hose bib so that we can defrost the valve enough to fill buckets. Our fingers go numb and refuse to work properly, and we know how much they’ll hurt when they thaw.
A few years ago, after turning out the horses on just such a morning, Gregg looked out the kitchen window and noticed Nibbs swinging his head repeatedly to look at his flank. Then Nibbs dropped to his knees and began to roll.
“Damn,” Gregg said.
“What’s wrong?” I asked.
Gregg had moved to the door and was struggling into his one-piece insulated barn suit. “I think Nibbs is colicking,” he said. He tugged his woolen hat low to cover his ears, picked up his veterinary kit, and went outside.
Colic, Gregg has told me often, is the equivalent of a human stomachache, except that horses can’t vomit — and for that reason, colic can be life-threatening. In Gregg’s estimation, horses have two significant design flaws: delicate legs and a detached colon (part of the large intestine). The majority of the organ isn’t anchored to anything internally, so its loops slide about as the horse moves. Sometimes the loops will twist, causing a pinch or a blockage, and perhaps even cutting off the blood supply.",en,books

"Et si on flinguait les touristes suédois, comme le propose ce député israélien ? On ne peut pas, parce qu’on aurait les droitdelhommistes sur le dos…
During a tour of the Israel-Egypt border on Sunday, MK Aryeh Eldad (National Union) said that IDF forces should shoot at anyone that crosses into Israeli territory.
“Anyone that penetrates Israel’s border should be shot, a Swedish tourist, Sudanese from Eritrea, Eritreans from Sudan, Asians from Sinai. Whoever touches Israel’s border – shot,” said Eldad.
MK Eldad, who stated that anyone approaching the fence should be shot, attempted to mitigate his statements. “It isn’t feasible to shoot anyone just climbing the fence – because bleeding hearts groups will immediately begin to shriek and turn to the courts. I don’t see the IDF handing down orders to shoot at people climbing the fence empty handed. The best alternative is prolonged imprisonment.

The Shockers, who have just a pair of setbacks this season against Tennessee and Evansville, are riding a four-game win streak and have captured 10 victories in the last 11 outings overall. On Saturday night the team routed the Bradley Braves at home in a 73-39 final to move to 8-1 in MVC and into sole possession of first place in the standings as WSU remained perfect at home through 12 games.
Now sporting a 19-game home win streak overall, the second-longest run ever for the program, WSU enters play this week tied with both top-ranked Michigan and seventh-ranked Gonzaga for the most wins in the country overall at 19.
As for the Sycamores, they've been a bit sporadic in recent weeks, sporting a 4-3 mark over the last seven outings. On Saturday Indiana State hosted Northern Iowa and just squeaked by in a 59-58 final. The victory was the third in the last four games overall and now the team is 6-3 in conference play which has it all alone in third place behind only WSU and Creighton.
Dating back to the 1977-78 campaign, the series between the teams is under the control of the Shockers who own a 50-28 edge versus Indiana State. Wichita State won all three meetings a season ago and has taken eight of the last nine overall, save for a 61-54 setback during the MVC Tournament in 2011.
Trailing by a point with time winding down, the Sycamores needed a minor miracle against Northern Iowa at the Hulman Center on Saturday afternoon. A three-pointer by Jake Odum that would have won the game missed the mark, but he was fouled with just 0.3 seconds remaining and after missing his first free-throw try he knocked down the other two in order to give ISU the 58-57 win against the Panthers. Odum finished with a game-high 16 points, as well as seven rebounds and five assists. R.J. Mahurin and Manny Arop contributed 14 and 10 points, respectively, for the hosts as well.
Through nine conference games this season the Sycamores are producing a modest 67.1 ppg, slightly better than the competition at 64.9 ppg. One of the better clutch players in the MVC, Odum is first on the unit with his 13.6 ppg and has delivered an average of almost four assists per contest as well. Arop (12.6 ppg) and Justin Gant (10.8 ppg) are both shooting at least 50.0 percent from the floor.
While shooting 51.0 percent from the field on Saturday night, including 6- of-15 behind the 3-point line, Wichita State held the Braves to a mere 31.9 percent accuracy from the field and forced almost as many turnovers (14) as it allowed field goals (15). Nick Wiggins led a quartet of double-digit scorers for the Shockers with 12 points off the bench, hitting all three of his triples, while fellow reserve Jake White posted 11 points and nine rebounds as the hosts crushed Bradley on the glass, 44-21. Cleanthony Early and Malcolm Armstead both tallied 10 points, the latter filling his stat line with eight assists, five rebounds and four steals as well.
In the last five games the Shockers have had a different leading scorer in four bouts, but overall this season the team is being paced by Early with his 15.2 ppg. Although he has appeared in only 14 of the unit's 21 contests, Carl Hall (12.9 ppg) is the only other double-digit scorer and is also first on the glass with close to eight boards per game, which come in handy for a program beating opponents on the glass by nine caroms per game right now.",en,web
"So I'm officially encouraging those close to me (which includes all of you lovely readers) to take on a project this weekend. Take your myriad of life-journaling Instagram photos offline and print them out. Whether you do it at home or at a photo center (if you can find one), you'll enjoy having a display of your life spread out at home for all to see.
Here's a few real-life rooms from around the web for inspiration:
• A wall of prints leveled and hung with painter's tape, from A Beautiful Mess.
• A small array hung with beading string and binder clips from MacLife.
• 365 different Instagram photos can fit in the InstaCanvas from Design Aglow (buy it here, $65).
• Bulldog clips, glued onto pieces of stained wood, can hold up prints and easily switch them out, from Bloom and Inspire.
• Prints were hot-glued in a grid onto 4 stretched canvases, in this photo from Under the Red Umbrella.
• Clothespins keep small prints set up inside an empty frame, from Life's Little Moments.
• Mini-clothespins and an empty frame again, this time painted with a pop of bright blue, from Good Willionaire.
• And finally, three real-life rooms submitted to the gallery of Canvas Pop, a website where you can print your online photos onto stretched canvas.

"ONALASKA, TEXAS. Onalaska is on Farm Road 356 by Lake Livingston, ninety miles north of Houston in western Polk County. It was settled during the Republic of Texas period and was developed by William Carlisle about 1905. Carlisle, a lumberman, named it after an older mill town he also operated, Onalaska, Arkansas. The Beaumont and Great Northern Railway had reached Onalaska from Trinity County by 1907 and was extended to Livingston the next year. By 1908 Onalaska had a depot, a bank, a hotel, an electric power plant, and a population of 2,000. The West Lumber Company had purchased the sawmill by 1909, but flooding from the Trinity River and the cutting out of local timber led to the mill's closure. By 1913 the sawmill had been dismantled. Although Onalaska remained a fairly prosperous agricultural community, its first boom days were over; the population had declined to 1,250 by 1925 and to eighty by the late 1940s. Upon the completion of Lake Livingston in 1968, however, the local economy recovered somewhat because of the added recreational opportunities it afforded. Onalaska had only two rated businesses in 1961 but twenty-eight by 1984. That year the population was 386, and in 1990 it was 728. By 2000 the population reached 1,174.

"Last night at dinner our conversation revolved around why CM2 does not like interference in his life. Well more specifically, why during their volunteering, when CM1 tries to help his brother with advice or information, does CM2 get angry with him. We tried to explain to CM1 that its not him personally but that his younger brother appears to resent any kind of help and perspective other than his own.
When asked why he rejects anyone's advice no matter how positive or helpful CM2 answered..
""I guess I just came late to that rebellious stage.""
I then asked,""If you know you are being rebellious why do you just reject suggestions out of hand and not think about what you are being told is helpful or not?""
For that I got the ""talk to the hand"" response.
Deciding not to have a full-blown fight and argument at the dinner table, we then turned to CM1 to try to explain to him that there comes a time in people's lives that sometimes they need to learn the hard way. Unfortunately there is this time in the life of a teenager that they decide not to listen to anyone. There is nothing you can really do about that except let them. (Within reason of course.)
CM1 is now, totally insulted that is brother rejects his advice. He sees trying to help CM2 over the glitches of adolescence as his form of caring about him. In truth it is, and the rejection does hurt. But we assured him that it was all well and good, but that right now he needs to only truly worry about himself. That yes, he went through a similar stage at about the same time and he turned out just fine. So will his brother. CM1 insisted that his brother needs to see the behavioralist like he does. For that I agreed and talked to her about starting with CM2 in the fall.
Meanwhile, hubby and I are on top of CM2 watching what he does and how he reacts in class. We do talk to him about how he interacts with people and how he studies. We are not letting his ""rebellious"" stage go uninterrupted. As hubby told both boys last night, just because the two of you are brilliant doesn't mean that society will accept you. You need to learn how to deal with and interact appropriately with people. You can be brilliant but live your life in our basement if you don't really pay attention to social norms. No one is required to ever have anything to do with you and people generally don't interact with shmucks.
Last night's lecture was prompted by the fact that CM2 yelled at some female students in his summer class. Apparently these girls had the nerve to play Justin Bieber music..I know the horror....apparently CM2 had turned to them and yelled at them to turn that crap off (which they did).....The hubby lecture consisted of CM2 practicing how nicely to tell them that they are being disruptive as everyone else was trying to work. Hubby made CM2 repeat it several times. Honestly its really lucky for CM2 that he is cute and that everyone around him continues to cut him some slack as he learns how to deal with the real world.
The problem with this youngman is that he just is too smart for his own good at times.....""rebellious stage"" by tuchas...
Still trying to figure out how to deal with the ""talk to the hand"" reaction....I think this is one for the hubby to figure out. Yeah CM2 did get lectured about it last night during the ""Bieber"" discussion too....Hubby said never again ""talk"" to me that way....
So far this morning so good..no ""talk to the hand"" and no ""rebellion"" excuses...we will see what happens as the day goes forward...but tonally he definitely has no patience for my existence...thankfully today is pragmatic speech therapy day. Yeah she noticed the tonal issues right away...glad that its really not me being over protective and that I noticed it is something he needs help with.

"It's more about having fun- even if you don't have someone to dance with.
""We don't need a partner,"" said Ladonna McGee.
This group of senior citizens slip on their dancing shoes for their line dancing class and as a way to stay in shape.
""It teaches balance, it is exercise, it keeps brain waves going and the main thing is its to socialize,"" said McGee.
They practice twice a week and its not just country music they dance to- they also learn Latin and Classic Pop dances as well.
It's all about keeping up with the beat- but no ones judging here if you fall out of step.
""You just kind of know what you're doing and if not then you just fall back in you don't get worried about it,"" said Arlene Wuske, one of the participants.
Arlene Wuske has danced for years and joined the class to ensure she maintains a healthy active lifestyle.
""I'm laughing, I'm having a reason to get out of the house I'm anxious to go out and have fun and afterwards i go have a drink,"" said the 65 year-old.
To her however, its more about the learning the steps- its about having a good time and keeping the music going in her life.
""I like to stay active so that I can do everything and not hurt, never hesitate every time anybody wants to ride a bike or run up a hill or jump around, I'm ready,"" she said.

Hamilton Grange National Memorial
Hamilton Grange National Memorial preserves the home of founding father Alexander Hamilton. Born and raised in the West Indies, Hamilton came to New York in 1772 at age 17 to study finance at King's College (now Columbia University). Hamilton became a supporter of the cause of the American patriots during the political turmoil of the 1770s. Commissioned as a Captain of Artillery at the beginning of the American Revolution, he soon became an aide-de-camp to George Washington.After the war, as a member of Congress, Hamilton was instrumental in creating the new Constitution. As co-author of the Federalist Papers he was indispensable in the effort to get the Constitution adopted. As the first Secretary of the Treasury (1789-1795) he devised plans for funding the national debt, securing federal credit, encouraging expansion of manufacturing and organizing the federal bank.Hamilton commissioned architect John McComb Jr. to design a Federal style country home on a sprawling 32 acre estate in upper Manhattan. This house was completed in 1802 and named ""The Grange"" after the Hamilton family's ancestral home in Scotland, but served as his home for only two years.",en,reference

"As rates in the high-yield market fell during the first quarter, a frenzy of sponsor-backed companies refinanced their debt to take advantage of cheap capital. Many private equity owners took dividends out of the deals as their companies took on more leverage.
But one such transaction, the dividend recap of Atlantic Broadband Inc. in March, stands out. In fact, it's being called a dividend ""precap"" because it allows another PE firm to buy the company without having to create a new financing structure.
Under the terms of the precap, if another financial sponsor were to acquire Atlantic Broadband, it would be able to access the same capital structure its current owners used for the recapitalization that paid their dividends.
That means if the capital markets continue to deteriorate -- as they have since the first quarter -- a buyer would have access to a more attractive capital structure not available elsewhere, says Jeff Cohen, the co-head of U.S. syndicated loan capital markets at Credit Suisse Group.
""In our view, this allows new prospective buyers to stretch a little more on terms, because they have no downside risk to the cost of capital,"" Cohen says. ""It's something we think other sponsors will be interested in.""
Atlantic Broadband's dividend precap appears to be the first of its kind. Owners Abry Partners LLC and Oak Hill Capital Partners LP took a $345 million dividend from the $1.06 billion first-lien credit facility that refinanced the nine-year-old investment's debt. That dividend, along with around $280 million in distributions they have received since 2007, more than doubled the firms' return on the original $216 million equity injection.
Dividend precaps work by avoiding a change-of-control provision found in most credit agreements that require a new capital structure if a deal gets done soon after a dividend recap. Typically, when a buyout or recapitalization happens, it triggers a credit agreement's change-of-control provision, technically sending a loan into default and requiring the buyer to obtain new financing.
Precap deals avoid that change-of-control provision, for a price. Typically, investors require a slightly higher spread -- 25 to 75 basis points -- to account for the precap's flexibility. Those additional basis points, in good credit markets, are usually a minor addition to the low cost of capital.
For sellers, the benefit of the precap is obvious: They get to show a small return to limited partners in the short term, with the promise of a possible sale soon thereafter. A detail in the agreement attempts to make the dividend precap more attractive to potential acquirers, too. The buyer would be allowed to obtain the same debt package used to refinance and pay the seller a dividend -- with its low interest rates and all.
These benefits are likely to be tested soon, since Atlantic Broadband is thought to be on the block. Sources told The Deal magazine in early May that the Quincy, Mass., company, the 14th-largest cable operator in the country, has retained Credit Suisse to explore a sale.
To get the benefits of the dividend precap, a buyer would have to fit some specific guidelines, including being a private equity firm, Cohen says. It would have to write a ""healthy equity check,"" he adds, in part ensuring that a company's leverage at the time of purchase is no higher than when the dividend was paid. Post-dividend ratings from agencies such as Moody's Investors Service also can't change at the time of purchase. The company, of course, must remain in compliance with all of the covenants in the original contract as well.
Finally, the buyer has to be a firm of rather substantial size -- likely with assets under management of more than $1 billion, Cohen says. ""The size of the buyer is one of the primary ways in which lenders can establish the buyer's credibility,"" he says.
Not all sponsor-backed companies qualify for dividend precaps. Typically, only stable businesses that have been performing well and have been in a single firm's portfolio for years will have the dividend precap opportunity. To be sure, that makes the field for potential precaps narrow. And it remains to be seen if the idea is intriguing enough to persuade a buyer on the fence to get a deal done. Still, if the cost of debt continues to rise, it very well makes a package like Atlantic Broadband's the most attractive capital on the market.

"We all know that being physically fit comes with its set of benefits. Living longer, being healthy, and overall well being to enjoy life at your full potential. However, the hard part comes way before you hit the treadmill – your motivation. Working out requires consistency and a truck load of passion and motivation just to get that first step out the door. The time is now to enjoy a good workout, instead of dreading it. Most importantly to stick to a work out, we need to understand the benefits of all the effort. Not only are you going to look great, but feel great too!
- Improves clear thinking with increased blood circulation
- Acts as mood lifter, a natural anti-depressant and reduces stress
- Protects the brain from damage and disease .
- Beautiful You: Exercise and overall fitness helps you detoxify your body and lets your skin breathe. It also helps to tone your body and enhance your overall appearance. So in short, physical fitness keeps you beautiful and glowing (your skin will thank you!).
- Self-Confidence: When you look good and you feel good, inhibitions and insecurities have no where to hang or bog you down! A healthy mind and a healthy body are big boosts to your self-confidence.
- Bye-Bye Illness: Yes, it is true. Moderated and balanced workout in a fitness regimen help to boost your body’s immune system. Fully functional and strong body immunity helps your body develop the strength to ward off diseases and infections.
- Lift someone’s spirit – Ask a friend every day to join you! Happiness is contagious and applying it to your workout is a win win for you and your work out partner…spread it! Lifting others’ moods not only make them happy but you reap the benefits also– so keep your spirits high, share the fun and SMILE!
- Choose a tried and true positive mental “reboot” – there’s millions of things that can ruin your mood in any given day. For those times, pick a positive habit – something that will return you to a state of relaxation. Here’s one of my fail safe goodies: Take 5 deep breaths and shake out your body, repeat “OMMMMM” with every out breath and give yourself a few moments to collect yourself. Although the situation may not change, your perspective might which could make all the difference to peacefully getting to the other side!
Remember ladies, it takes 4 weeks for you to see a change in your body and 8 weeks for your family and friends to notice that change. Nothing good ever comes easy so the faster you can embrace slow change is lasting change, the better. It will help you break the quick fix obsession that gets us into trouble every time. If your goal is to stick with it for health’s sake, you’re on your way to success…the pounds will do what they need to do. Just HAVE FUN and get OUT THERE!!
So be patient and enjoy your fabulous workout regimen!",en,reference

"South Korea Delays Rocket as Eyes Turn to North's Site (Seoul)
(c) 2012, Bloomberg News.
SEOUL, South Korea — South Korea cancelled plans to launch a civilian space rocket Thursday because of a technical problem while speculation mounted that North Korea may defy the international community with another ballistic missile test.
The liftoff of the 33-meter (108-feet) KSLV-I rocket, or Naro, and its 100-kilogram research satellite was halted shortly after 4 p.m., Cho Yul-rae, vice science minister, said in a televised briefing. He didn't say when the launch, which will be the country's third attempt to put a satellite into orbit using a rocket built with domestic and Russian technology, may resume.
Activity at North Korea's launch site is consistent with preparations before the botched firing of a rocket in April that cost the regime an American food-aid deal, according to satellite company DigitalGlobe Inc. South Korea has spent about $500 million on the Naro project to gain a toehold in the space- services market while countries including the U.S. contend the North's program is cover for missile development.
""North Korea may want to restore its national pride after the failed launch,"" Baek Seung-joo, who studies the Pyongyang regime's military at the Korea Institute of Defense Analyses in Seoul, said Wednesday by telephone. ""If South Korea succeeds with the Naro rocket, the North's technology will look weak in comparison.""
Kim Jong Un's government may be in a position to conduct a test by mid-December, DigitalGlobe said on its website, citing a Nov. 23 image of the Sohae Satellite Launching Station.
North Korea, which announced plans for its last launch almost a month in advance, has not signaled another test is imminent while State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland declined to comment on Nov. 27 on any intelligence assessment of satellite images.
The regime could behave provocatively at any time, South Korean President Lee Myung-bak said Nov. 27 in remarks to military commanders, without commenting on any preparations North Korea may be making for a missile test. South Korea's military was watching the North as usual and had not changed its alert levels, an official at the Joint Chiefs of Staff said Nov. 23 after the Asahi newspaper reported the United States told Japan and South Korea it had detected preparations for a possible missile test.
South Korea's presidential election on Dec. 19 would weigh against Kim firing a missile before then, said Baek of the defense institute. It would reduce the chances of economic aid from South Korea, harden the U.S. stance against Pyongyang and embarrass the new leadership in China, Kim's main benefactor.
Success with the Naro rocket could bring long-term economic benefits of as much as 3 trillion won for South Korea via higher value-added exports and a share of the space-services market, according to the science ministry.",en,web
"The World's Largest and Yet Smallest Seeing Microscope
The LHC is a 17-mile eliptical tunnel under the Swiss-French border, at Geneva. Great magnets installed throughout its length alter the flow of light beams so that they ultimately are made to cross, resulting in occasional particle collisions. In a recent experiment, for instance, the photon beams began their multiple 17-mile circuits in opposite directions about ten days prior to the impact. They traveled in near vacuum and with the temperature reduced to but two degrees above absolute zero, ""the coldest place in the universe."" When the collision occurred the energy of impact, at seven trillion electron volts, was three times the force of any previous tests of particle contacts.
Earlier trials of the LHC had led to expensive systems failure and required many millions of dollars and months of repairs to get the Large Hadron Collider ready for last month's new attempts. It is anticipated that several years of research will be done in the run-up to the most refined LHC uses, ones which may unlock secrets of modern quantum physics or even explanations for how the universe came to be the way it is, from its earliest beginnings in a hypothetical Big Bang.
The LHC cost $10 billion to complete. The U.S. had a similar, or even superior, supercollider in the works, in Texas, but Congress later decided not to release the rest of the money, so it was scrapped after over a billion dollars had already been spent on its development.
Using the now operational Large Hadron Collider, the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) is thus leading the world in experiments at the frontier of physics. They photograph the photon collisions and their effects at a rate of several million images per second, much complicated software processing then being required to separate all the irrelevant data from what may make a difference in evaluating the experimental results.
Before the world's first atomic blast, scientists were not sure if it would be contained or if its chain reaction might simply expand until our entire world had exploded or perhaps been transformed into a new sun. Similarly, with the advent of routine experimentation via the LHC, some are afraid it might create black holes that would envelop Earth along with the rest of the Solar System. However, CERN researches dismiss this as not possible.
Collisions of ultra-high-speed particles in the supercollider are expected to reveal the forces at work when the universe was but trillionths of a second old and still unimaginably small. Deductions made possible about the universe's beginnings from this kind of new knowledge are equivalent then to concentrating a gargantuan microscope on the tiniest of samples of reality ever examined. How cool is that!?

"A series of New Zealand performances by reggae star, and son of the late legend Peter Tosh, Andrew Tosh have been announced. Tosh will be backed by New Zealand’s David Grace & Injustice.
2012 marks not only the 50th anniversary of Jamaica’s independence, but also the 25th anniversary of Peter Tosh’s tragic and untimely death in Jamaica.
Andrew Tosh, only 20 years old when his father was murdered, performed two songs at the funeral service. His career would take off in earnest the following year with the release of his debut album, Original Man; the follow-up, Make Place For The Youth, earned a Grammy nomination.
His most recent releases, Andrew Sings Tosh: He Never Died (2004) and Legacy: An Acoustic Tribute To Peter Tosh are critically acclaimed tributes to the legacy of his father. Legacy: An Acoustic Tribute To Peter Tosh earned a Grammy nomination in 2010.
Andrew Tosh will fly to France for a European tour directly from New Zealand in July, following five weeks in the country.
Tickets for the shows are available from the venues and from www.eventfinder.co.nz.
I have included an excerpt from Tosh’s show in Curitiba, Brazil from December 17, 2005.
I have said it before, and I will say it again now. I saw Andrew Tosh and Michael Rose on tour together in 1999 and it was, without a doubt, the best experience I’ve ever had at a reggae show. Tosh left it all on stage that night. You will not be disappointed by seeing Tosh live.",en,web

Review by Beth T. Cholette, Ph.D. on Apr 7th 2009
This new offering from lifestyle company Gaiam features Pilates instructor Linda Farrell. Pilates Slide & Sculpt is a 35-minute workout DVD which uses both sliding discs and a resistance band to mimic Pilates reformer work. Therefore, the DVD (which comes in a very thin cardboard sleeve) is packaged with two 9 ½"" square sliding discs (with optional covers for use with hard floors) and one long green resistance band. The workout is filmed outdoors against a grassy, mountainous backdrop; Farrell is exercising barefoot on a wooden platform, and she is using the covers over her own discs.
During the workout, Farrell frequently alternates between using the discs and the band, although she sometimes uses the two together for a greater challenge. She begins on the floor, using the band for the traditional Pilates warm-up, the hundred. Next comes a move which she states is adapted from the reformer, footwork: lying with a disc under each foot, you will alternate gliding one foot in and out, progressively increasing the difficulty level by raising your arms overhead, then moving both feet together, and finally adding the arms overhead with both feet. Farrell then returns to the band for the roll up and a spinal twist. Remaining in a seated position, Farrell anchors the band under the buttocks and continues with the discs, using them to stretch to the side, forward and back, and finishing with a twist; she repeats this sequence using the band. She states that the next series, stomach massage, has also been adapted from the reformer: she again places the discs under the feet and moves the feet in and out, but this time while seated. She finishes here with the Pilates criss-cross, still sliding her feet in and out while on the discs. Finally, Farrell picks up the band to conclude the seated work with rowing, chest expansion, and shaving the head.
Returning to lying, this time Farrell raises her buttocks in the air before again sliding the feet in and out on the disks to work the hamstrings. She then flips over to her stomach for prone work, using the disks under her hands for moves which include the swan extension and swimming; the band is also used in this segment. The side lying or leg kick series follows; with a disc under the feet and under one hand, Farrell spends about three minutes on each side. The final floorwork segment is what she calls the knee stretch series: first, there is some work on all fours and in plank, and next, there is a sequence that flows between the yoga postures down dog and up dog, sliding with the discs under the feet. Coming to standing, Farrell calls the final eight minutes of the workout ""Stand and Slide."" Here she has the disks under her feet, and she lunges to the side in a fencer's lunge as well as forward and back, moving almost quickly enough to produce an aerobic effect. She also adds in the band to get the upper body involved with triceps and biceps work. The workout ends with a very brief stretch (about 1 minute) which includes a seated spine stretch forward and saw twist.
In the end, I had mixed feelings about this workout. I have used gliding discs before and generally enjoy the unique challenge that they provide. However, I found that both the larger size and the square shape of these discs made them a bit unwieldy to use. In addition, my workout room has a flat, Berber-like carpet, and I found that the disks (minus the covers), did not always glide freely over this surface as intended. The other issue I had was with the workout itself, as I found the difficulty level to be quite uneven. Farrell states that the workout is ""perfect for the Pilates practitioner wanting to take their workout to the next level,"" but I'm not sure that this is the case. There were many points in which the workout was quite easy, as Farrell starts with a very basic variation of the exercise before increasing the challenge. In other instances, however, the difficultly level was quite advanced, such as when she performs the hamstring moves with both legs. Therefore, I'm not sure exactly who the idea target audience for this workout would be, although it is probably best suited to those with some Pilates experience who are interested in adding new elements to their Pilates practice.

"On Peet’s: Protect local businesses from formula stores
I question the objectivity of our City Council in general, and specifically Steve Barbose. With a well-thought-out formula store ordinance in place, and a seemingly deliberative planning commission having made a negative recommendation, the council runs off the rails with hearts in their eyes when Peet’s wants to come to town.
?It is downright hypocritical of Barbose to suggest that Taco Bell or Long John Silver’s would be any more or less welcome in the same place, considering all the same traffic, jobs, and tax income as Peet’s.
In fact, I’d be willing to bet both of those other companies would bring more jobs and more tax revenue, but none of them serve trendy, brand name coffee.?
Please try not to ignore the local businesses, local income and local people that will be impacted by opening an out-of-town chain store that will compete with local interests. ?In fact, if the City Council is going to ignore the recommendations of the planning commission, why don’t we just get rid it?

"Against evidence-based policy-making
The big lie about evidence-based policy-making is that it’s based on evidence. Evidence no more produces and speaks for itself than cars decide their destinations. Policy-making begins when people perceive a need for a policy. Even when it is evidence which moves a person to speak for a policy, such evidence is always seen through the prejudices, preconceptions and presuppositions that every human sees the world through. The desire for objectivity in politics, while seemingly sensible, belies a terrible loss of self-confidence, and can typically hide what should be political decisions under the guise of ’science’.
There was never a time when policies were made deliberately, in spite of evidence. So it is therefore hard to understand what gave rise to the policy of policy-based evidence-making. Was there evidence of a need? The expression itself seems to borrow from ‘evidence-based medicine’, which nobody could fail to see the sense in. But in what sense is policy-making like medicine? Evidence-based policy making casts policy and evidence makers as clinicians and society as its patient.
The problem with this analogy with the doctor-patient relationship is that, when it comes to politics, it really ought to be us ‘patients’ who determine what is wrong with ‘us’. Policy-makers – previously known as ‘politicians’ — always had their ideas and arguments about symptoms and remedies to society’s maladies, but it was the electorate who made the final diagnosis after public debate and democratic contests. Now policy-makers make appeals directly to the evidence-makers for authority.
Not only is there a danger that those who once spoke truth to power are now appointed to speak official truth for official power — think ’sexed up documents’ and ‘dodgy dossiers’ — this new arrangement is itself every bit as ‘ideological’ as the forms of politics that preceded it. Yet the ‘ideology’ — the prejudices, presuppositions and preconceptions — of this arrangement is put beyond interrogation.
To take issue with the claims made by ‘evidence-based policy-makers’ is seen to be taking issue with cold, hard, scientifically-produced facts. In a word: Denial. ‘Deny’ that the evidence for climate change legitimises climate change policies, for instance, and you’ll find yourself accused of being ‘ideologically-motivated’, irrationally driven by a commitment to unshakable beliefs.
But perhaps climate change is too emotive an issue. Arguments made in favour of many policies intended to improve public health are also seemingly premised on science. For example, the abolition of smoking in public places (and soon cars); further restrictions and taxes on tobacco, alcohol, and junk food; the advertising of certain products; and so on. Weak theoretical risk is no obstacle to policy-making, as long as the ‘evidence’ seems to show that lives may be saved. But even where there is strong evidence that a policy will yield a positive result, scientific evidence means nothing at all until we – or rather policy -makers – make the assumption that people aren’t able to negotiate risks for or between themselves, and need policy to protect them from the complex and dangerous world we inhabit.
That’s an intensely political or ‘ideological’ presupposition. It presumes competence to take decisions on behalf of others, on the basis that they aren’t competent. Politics – policy-making – now becomes a matter of simply managing risks in society and evidence-makers are recruited into the process of identifying and measuring risks. And just as people are, in this view, incapable of managing the risks they are exposed to, so they are incapable of making political decisions.
This presupposition of widespread incompetence is insidious. There’s no room for contested values in this way of looking at the world, and so little need of public debate. And therein lies the problem. There really should be a public debate about the values which inform the interpretation of evidence, or in other words, the extent to which it should be presupposed that adults can or cannot manage their own lives. The idea that people are capable of making political decisions, and choices about the risks they take may be ‘ideological’ and fraught with problems. But no more so than the idea that they aren’t able to. Debate about the values that inform policies permits seeing the same evidence under different lights. An ideological preoccupation with risk colours the perception of evidence.
Over-emphasis on evidence in policy-making is corrosive to a public debate about the values which inform the interpretation of evidence. It excludes resource-poor perspectives and non-expert public from the debate, and encourages a dangerous passivity. Rather than being excluded from political decisions leading to their improvement, ‘ideology’, hidden and unchallenged, has been allowed to fester, leading to the sclerosis of public institutions and democracy. Better evidence has been sought while the quality of debate has diminished. Opportunities have been missed, because, when ‘ideology’ flies in the face of evidence, it creates the possibility of exposing the shortcomings of the ‘ideology’ in question, to interrogate it, and to develop it. That opportunity is lost to a vacuous consensus, the members of which are united only by their nervousness of challenges to their own… ideology.

"The Dept. of Energy has maintained a continual R&D effort since the late 1970's to develop photovoltaic (PV) solar cells of ever increasing efficiency. Initial developments in silicon PV material have ultimately given way to higher efficiency III-V multi-junction materials - raising efficiency levels from 12% to nearly 42%. Although these new materials show great promise, they are ultimately restricted by the naturally occurring materials available to convert incident sunlight into electricity. These natural materials, which provide discrete and limited bandgap options, are poor converters of broad spectrum energy. Metamaterials offer the potential to shift solar spectrums toward wavelengths that are more suitable for energy conversion or to design manmade nano-crystalline lattices that are optimized for a given spectrum. As such, the common sources of PV inefficiency - thermalization of supra-bandgap photons and transparency of sub-bandgap photons - can be minimized for a given spectrum, significantly improving the performance of a PV cell. In addition, the simultaneous thermal conductance, electrical conductance, and transparency of metamaterials can be applied in the near-term to various areas of photocell design. The Optical Metamaterials Program is currently looking at metamaterial designs aimed at:
Transparent conductors for reduced PV material obscuration
PV optical coatings for improved thermal transfer to heatsinks
Lattice compatible interstitial reflectors and filters for increased photon absorption in CPVs
Light Emitting Diode (LED) Lighting
Nearly 30% of the electricity consumed in the United States is associated with artificial lighting. Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) have the potential to dramatically reduce this usage by utilizing diode emitters that are more energy efficient and longer lasting than traditional incandescent or fluorescent sources. However, LEDs must overcome a number of technical challenges before they can achieve their optimal efficiency. These factors include optimizing internal quantum efficiency, outcoupling of emitted light, chip shape, and LED packaging. Ultimately, metamaterials can be a powerful new tool for addressing each and every one of these challenges. However, in the near-term, the benefits of metamaterials are likely to first be seen in the area of optimized outcoupling of emitted light. Light emitted at an LED cavity must be coupled to an integrated lens so that the divergence of the LED output can be controlled and waste heat (due to internal optical absorption) can be minimized. To date, limited success has been achieved with naturally occurring materials and significant optical loss and heat gain result due to total internal reflection (TIR) of the internally generated light. The Optical Metamaterials Program is focused on using metamaterial coatings and metamaterial micro-lenses to provide a negative index of refraction optical interface to significantly reduce TIR losses. These coatings/materials can be applied directly to the face of the LED surface or at an internal interstitial layer making them applicable to a variety of LED types.
Thermal Photovoltaics (PV)
Thermal photovoltaics (TPV) convert heat into electricity using direct long-wave photon conversion or an intermediate thermal-to-near IR converter/emitter. Recent research has shown that the absorption of thermal wavelengths for re-emission at near IR wavelengths can be achieved with highest efficiency when captured in a metamaterial as opposed to a naturally occurring materials. The design of metamaterial nanoscale lattices, as opposed to the atom-scale lattices of natural materials, is better suited to the thermal wavelengths frequently encountered in waste heat recovery applications. The development of improved metamaterials for thermal PV applications is still in its infancy but has the potential to significantly improve the efficiency of thermal PV cells within the next 5-10 years.
Optical microscopy is a well-established field that began nearly 400 years ago. With naturally occurring materials, optical microscopy has been limited in resolution to the optical diffraction limits of light. However, recent research has demonstrated that metamaterial plano lenses (called SuperLenses) can focus optical light well below the diffraction limit. This exciting phenomenon, first predicted by Victor Veselago in 1967, has just recently been demonstrated for some limited metamaterial coatings. A bulk version of these coatings could one day lead to optical microscopes that can image at resolutions approaching today's most sophisticated and expensive scanning electron microscopes, atomic force microscopes, photon tunneling microscopes, etc. The Optical Metamaterials Program is working to develop metamaterial layer fabrication techniques that can be ""stacked"" to produce a superlens with low-efficiency but sub-diffraction performance nonetheless. Early research is focused around specialized glass drawing techniques developed for other areas of DOE research.
Sensors have numerous applications relevant to the DOE mission. Whether it's the development and integration of distributed sensors for the emerging smart grid, improved sensors for greater energy efficient industrial processes, or sensors for detecting and tracking nuclear materials, sensors are a key component of DOE's R&D activities. Metamaterials promise to open an entirely new field of sensor capabilities based on the unique index of refraction characteristics of this material. The Optical Metamaterials Program is developing planar waveguide sensors that interact the evanescent fields of weakly guided light with newly developed cladding metamaterials. These interactions results in optical sensors with high sensitivity to environmental factors (i.e. strain, pressure, temperature, etc.) beyond the limits of conventional sensor. In addition, the ""optical magnetism"" properties of metamaterials are being explored for nano-sized electrical power measurement devices for potential integration into the emerging SmartGrid.
Quantum computers have the potential to solve critical problems much more quickly than classical computers (i.e. Shor's algorithm). Although quantum computing is still in its infancy, experiments have been carried out in which quantum computational operations are being executed on a small number of qubits (quantum binary digits). Of particular interest to our program are optical quantum computing techniques based on entangled photons. One of the key components to realizing this approach is the development of a variable optical delay material capable of trapping photons for long periods of time (i.e. milliseconds). A metamaterial with a sufficiently high index of refraction could achieve these levels of delay and, when incorporating electro-optical materials (i.e. liquid crystals), could also be adjustable. Currently, the Optical Metamaterials Program is working to better characterize the relationship between plasmonics and metamaterials on trapping and entanglement phenomena associated with this field.",en,academic

"Hatch is working with CS Energy to implement its asset management improvement strategy
Hatch has been selected by CS Energy as one of a panel of specialist service providers to support an extensive asset-management improvement program across its portfolio of thermal power stations in Queensland, Australia.
CS Energy, the largest of three Queensland government-owned power generating corporations, owns and operates four thermal power stations: Swanbank, Callide, Kogan Creek and Mica Creek. These power stations have a combined capacity of 3,660 MW, which constitutes approximately 35% of Queensland's total installed generation capacity.
The four stations are spread across Queensland and range in age from the late 1950s to the early 2000s. As a result, CS Energy is presented with unique challenges to deliver portfolio-wide reporting and business tools and procedures that can be effectively deployed to guide and support asset management practices across all sites.
The multi-faceted asset-management improvement program has been initiated by CS Energy to reverse the deteriorating trend over the past few years in the reliability of its power stations.
To date, Hatch's role in the program includes:
- Developing an asset management policy and guidelines as a high-level document for all of CS Energy's power stations
- Engaging the entire CS Energy organization on the virtues of the asset-management improvement program and how each person can contribute to its success including ongoing asset management and asset reliability improvement
- Developing standard maintenance work management processes and practices across all sites
- Undertaking equipment criticality assessments at each site to enable improved risk management and workload prioritization.

The Island's Name
The legends about how Inishbofin got its name are many - as T.W. Westropp, writing in the Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy in 1911 declared -""The legends of the island are in inverse ratio to the history"". By this, he was referring to the imbalance in the knowledge available on both the history of the island and the legends which surround it. The name ""Inishbofin"" means ""The Island of the White Cow"" and in the folklore which has survived, there are indeed more than a few stories containing a white cow.
According to one legend - in times past Inishbofin was a supernatural island which floated on the sea and was covered in mist. One day, quite by chance, a group of fishermen who were lost, landed and decided to light a fire. The smoke cleared the mists and in the embers the fishermen saw a vision of an old woman driving a white cow. When the cow reached the water, the woman hit it, turning it instantly into a rock. When one of the fishermen challenged the old woman, he too was turned to stone.
Another legend tells of how the island was under the spell of a beautiful woman and how it was broken. One day a father and son were out fishing for mackerel and they had brought with them some hot turf, in their boat, to cook some of the fish. While they were preparing some of their catch they heard birds singing and cattle and sheep as if nearby. When they stood up to see where the sounds were coming from, the boat toppled and the hot sods fell into the water. As the turf splashed into the waves, an island appeared before them. In the distance they could see a beautiful woman driving a white cow towards a lake. The son tried to catch the cow, grabbing hold of its tail - it fell away and turned into seaweed. The father pursued the woman, who threw herself into the lake and as she did so the spell on Inishbofin was broken.
St Colman - The Link With Mayo Abbey
These tales of enchantment survive to this day, but the first written historical reference to the island is in the 8th century work of the Venerable Bede in his Ecclesiastical History of the English People. He is the first to tell how St. Colman came to settle on Inishbofin and build his church there in 667 AD. Colman had been a monk on Iona from 623 - 652 AD., years of great missionary zeal in the monastery. During this time Northumbria was evangelised and Aidan, from Iona, had founded a monastery at Lindisfarne. His second successor as abbot was Colman, who was to the fore in defending the Irish ecclesiastics at the Synod of Whitby. When his friend, King Oswy of Northumbria, ruled in favour of the Roman observance of Easter, Colman was defeated and resolved to leave Northumbria forever. Determined not to abandon the traditions of his ancestors, he returned first to Lindisfarne -
""Colman, the Irish Bishop, departed from Britain and took with him all the Irish that he had assembled in the Island of Lindisfarne, and also about 30 of the English nation, who had been instructed in the monastic life, and leaving some brothers in his church of Lindisfarne, he repaired just to the Island of Hii, whence he had been first sent to preach the Word of God to the English Nation. Afterwards, he retired to a small island, which is to the west of Ireland, and at some distance from its coast, called in the language of the Irish, Inishbofinde, that is the Island of the White Cow."" [Bede Ecc. Hist. B.IV. C. 4]
Here, we are told that Colman built his church, and it seems that he met with no opposition from the natives. Archaeological investigation has shown that the island was inhabited previous to the arrival of Colman and his monks, and that it is probably these people who have built the great duns and cliff forts. Bede's account is confirmed by the Annals of Ulster which say that Colman came in the year in which Diarmait and Blathmae died i.e. 664 and that he founded his monastery and built his church in Inishbofin.
We are also told that Colman's mixed band of followers did not get along and that this was the impetus behind his journey to the mainland which eventually led him to the Plain of the Yew Trees, the place we now know as Mayo Abbey. Bede describes it thus:
""Arriving there (Inishbofin) he built a monastery and placed in it the monks he had brought with him of both nations; who not agreeing among themselves, by reason that the Scots (that is the Irish) in the summer season, when the harvest was to be brought in, leaving the monastery, wandered about through places with which they were acquainted, yet wished to get a share of what the English monks had provided for their common table Colman sought to put an end to these discussions; and, travelling about, at length found a place in Ireland yet to build a monastery, which in the language of the Scots is called Mageo"" [Ecc. Hist. B. IV. C.4]
Colman is the link between Inishbofin and Mayo Abbey and while the latter went on to become a school of some importance, the monastery on Inishbofin vanishes from the records around the 10th century. Colman returned to Inishbofin, from where he ruled both houses until his death on August 8th 676 AD. Today there are no remains of his first church which was probably built of wood - the ruins which now occupy the site in the townland of Knock are of a later date.
The island continued to attract those interested in the monastic life, as the names of some of the places on the island testify. The patron saint of Killaloe spent some time there and is remembered in the name given to a holy well to the south-west of St. Colman's oratory - ""Tobar Flannain"". In the townland of Middle Quarter a disciple of Colman's, lived as a recluse and the site of his house is still known and is called in Irish ""Aittighe Guarim"" or Guarm's house.
Later History of the Island
The ecclesiastical heritage of the island has been overshadowed by Mayo Abbey and seems to have faded from the records. There are few references in the annals and the next substantial mention comes in 1684 in Roderick O'Flaherty's ""A Chorographical Description of West of H - Iar Connacht"". This attracted wider attention when it was edited by the famous antiquarian James Hardiman in 1846, who wrote
""From the seventh century to the seventeenth century this island was little known beyond the neighbouring shores of Iar Connacht and Umhall ui Mhaille; but during the latter eventful century it was considered of importance by the then contending parties in Ireland and was alternately fortified by them"".
In the 16th century the Spaniards harassed the west coast of Ireland and one of their leaders, Alonzo Bosco, settled on Inishbofin and used it as his base from which to terrorise the inhabitants on the mainland. Grace O'Malley, the pirate queen, also used the island, establishing a fort and stationing her fleet there. However during the reign of Elizabeth I, the British army subdued the island and built a castle, the ruins of which overlook the entrance to the harbour. During the 17th century, the garrison on Inishbofin sided with the Catholic Stuart kings and the fortress was the last in the British Isles to fly their standard. The island was so remote, so cut off from mainstream political events, that it was some years later before they heard that there was no longer a king in England.
During Cromwell's time Inishbofin did receive some attention - he strengthened the castle and increased the garrison and it was to there he first sent exiles destined for the Barbados Islands. While on Bofin they were subjected to appalling cruelty, many of the prisoners actually died on the island. After the Cromwellian domination, the garrison was forgotten, with soldiers inter-marrying and settling on the island. This pattern was echoed on Aran and in other fortresses in remote parts of the southwest.
The Island Today
Situated 8 miles out to sea, Inishbofin is the largest in an archipelago which includes Inishark, Davillaun and Inishlion. Once the property of the Marquis of Clanrickard, it was, by the 1830's in the ownership of the Marquis of Sligo. Well suited to fishing, the island benefitted from the foundation of the Congested Districts Board in 1890, which, together with the Fisheries Branch of the Department of Agri-culture, placed the fishing industry as the island's principal business.
Today the island is sparsely populated - a conservative estimate would say around 150 (compared with 959 in 1881) and the community faces all the problems of their fellow islanders off the coast of Ireland. A trip to Inishbofin in August of this year showed it to be a friendly hospitable place of immense interest - historically and archaeologically. Its magnificent landscape is coupled with panoramic views of mountains along the west coast. On the east side the island faces the month of Killery Harbour and on the southern side, the mountains of Connemara. When there it is easy to understand the attraction such a remote sanctuary held for Colman and his monks.

"Dwight Howard and the Biggest Posers in the NBA
Before I start off this article, let me first say that I respect each and every one of these players. I admire the work they put in to get to the level they're currently at and they deserve all the credit for achieving their biggest goals and dreams.
So, that makes it a lot easier to say that we're going to find and discuss the NBA's top five biggest posers.
What exactly is a poser? It's a player that's either attempting to be something they're not or a player that creates more problems than solutions. Whether it's on or off the court, these five usually are attempting to put on the facade that they're a completely different person.
Some are physical specimens that play small and others are small players that attempt to pass themselves off as big.
Either way, they all share the same characteristic of attempting to be something they're not or completely going against the gameplan. Instead of making the necessary adjustments and sacrifices needed, after demanding a trade to that team, you may just earn yourself a spot on the league's biggest posers.
We take a look at these five players and the reasons why they have ended up on this unfortunate list.

It's become incredibly agitating seeing Dwight Howard and his latest opinion every other day.
It's annoying mostly because he didn't have to be in this situation in the first place. Howard was a free agent heading into the summer, but decided to take on an opt-in clause that would allow another year for the Orlando Magic to either make a compelling trade or find the players that could help Dwight to another Finals appearance.
Instead, Howard started accusing the Magic organization of blackmailing him, although it's reasonable to believe Dwight didn't know what blackmail meant at the time. This came about when Dwight was under the belief the Magic front office tricked him into staying another year.
The Magic want to get rid of Dwight by this point, which is why they're listening to these awful offers from Brooklyn and the Los Angeles Lakers.
They're tired of the headache their franchise center is causing and their angry that they just let go of their general manager and head coach because of Dwight, who was believed to have been behind a coup to oust Stan Van Gundy as the Magic coach.
Now we continue to wait. The teams that Howard wants to go to don't have the trade chips to acquire him and every other team is backing off due to Dwight only wanting to re-sign in either L.A. or BK.
So much for Dwight caring about his fans. He's completely turned the fanbase against him after the embarrassing sequence of events that have taken place over the past few months.

It's beginning to be tough to believe that Carmelo Anthony is capable of leading this New York Knicks team towards a championship run.
In a little over a season since he joined the Knicks, Anthony has yet to make a single adjustment. He took on the facilitator role early on and finished the season averaging only 3.6 assists per game to go along with a mere 22.6 points per game on 43 percent shooting. 'Melo's shooting and scoring were at the lowest since early on in his career.
Anthony is an excellent player in an isolation setting, but he can't seem to involve his teammates. In fact, he's made Amar'e Stoudemire look worse every time they're on the floor together.
There were too many instances last season where Anthony would be taking nearly three times as many shots as Stoudemire, a player who was once arguably known as the best scorer at his position.
That's what Carmelo can do. He doesn't involve his teammates enough. Those one-on-one situations can only work for so long, before you have to begin involving your teammates in order to actually win games.
The only way the Knicks make a breakthrough and advance themselves is if Anthony makes the sacrifice and adjustment of playing off the ball and attempting to pass more.
This Knicks team is too stacked not to work. They have two excellent scorers and the league's top defender; there are absolutely no excuses for this team to get ousted in the first round.
Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images
I'll let Udonis Haslem handle this one:
‘I think sometimes people just use the TVs and the cameras and the crowd, you know, to put on a show. I don’t think he’s all that he shows out there on the court. I think anybody can be a tough guy with a thousand people watching on TV and referees who call fouls and stop the game and different things like that. I don’t seeing him being any tough guy that he puts on the show to be, at all … If we were playing at the park, I don’t think he’d be doing all that.""
The Miami Heat have had some bouts with Kendrick Perkins since his Boston Celtics days. With Dwyane Wade driving to the rim as much as he did to will his team to victory, the Celtics would utilize Perkins as the bruising center who would hack at Wade to send a message.
Obviously, his longtime teammates, such as Haslem, would have something to say about it.
Perkins also had something to say to LeBron James. Following Blake Griffin's tremendous poster on Kendrick, LeBron James sent out a tweet praising Griffin's dunk and downplaying the dunk he had over John Lucas that same day.
Of course, Perkins had something to say to James, despite the rest of the NBA world also having something to say.
Why single out LeBron? He's not even saying anything about Kendrick Perkins in the first place. Blake could have performed the same dunk over any defender and James would have said the same thing. It's just Kendrick attempting to stir up some more animosity.
And the perma-scowl etched on Perkins face? It can only work for so long.

Blake Griffin is a 6'10"", 250-pound man-beast that is capable of jumping over buildings and running through brick walls.
Things like this should never happen.
If you're that big and constantly creating contact in the lane, your jaw running into someone's shoulder shouldn't cause you to writhe in agony for an entire possession. There's a fine line between selling the foul and making yourself look foolish, and Griffin had no trouble crossing it and establishing an entire new area of the art of flopping.
Understood that a lot of star players flop, but Griffin should never be flopping over minor hits or even attempting to flop in the first place. That's not a reputation you want to build early in your career, especially when it seems that so many opponents are gunning for you.
Blake's become a target of many overly-physical fouls as a result of teams attempting to send a message.
The message is mostly used to keep Blake out of the lane, but it's also a message to experience contact worth complaining over.
At the age of 23 and after only two years, there's no room to flop and then constantly argue for fouls. I'd say when a jump shot and some solid defense comes around, then Blake could have some reasons to run to the officials in hopes that they'll reverse their decision and make a different call, preferably in his favor.

This one may be surprising to some, but if you saw what I saw in the Miami Heat's series against the Indiana Pacers, you'll know exactly what I'm talking about.
Danny Granger could not stop attempting to start an altercation with either Dwyane Wade or LeBron James. Numerous times throughout the series, Granger was caught annoying the two and attempting to create a situation out of nothing.
Maybe once to send a message, but throughout the series?
He pulled on James' jersey to create an altercation, went over the top of LeBron to start a fight, and even going after Dwyane Wade, a player who is four inches shorter than him. That's three separate altercations in a series that lasted six games, all facilitated by Granger
Who is Granger attempting to fool? He's usually been mild-mannered, so why did he suddenly become this big talker in a series against the Heat?
If he was trying to send a message, it obviously didn't happen because James and Wade shook off each instance. Granger was just attempting to annoy the two into playing badly, instead of utilizing his own average defensive abilities to contain either of the two.
Either way, it was embarrassing; because Granger is certainly not the player who should be facilitating altercations.",en,web
"Good job by Bebe!
She only fell on the 3F & bailed out of the 3-turns-into the 3R. But had a great comeback with a 3L/2T (though I think the 3L was 2footed) & a 3F/2T. Also enjoyed her very brief fan skid spiral (reminded me of Sasha Cohen's). And her 2A has always been a beauty! Such a little spitfire!

"We speak with Ricardo Alarcon about the case of the Cuban 5 — five Cuban nationals arrested in 1998 and accused of being spies and a threat to US national security. [includes rush transcript]
A story that has been major news in Cuba, but has gotten little attention in this country is the case of the Cuban 5—five Cuban nationals arrested in 1998 and accused of being spies and a threat to the national security of the United States. Last month, a federal appeals court overturned their convictions and ordered a new trial for the men.
- Ricardo Alarco, President of the Cuban National Assembly
This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.
AMY GOODMAN: I asked Ricardo Alarcon, President of the Cuban National Assembly, what Cuba is now demanding in their case.
RICARDO ALARCON: Well, freedom, immediately. They are, technically speaking, they’re now kidnapped. They have been detained since September, 1998. Seven years have passed. In May, this year, an independent panel of experts of the U.N. Human Rights Commission, three ladies and two gentlemen, none of them from Cuba, a lady from Spain, another from Paraguay, Algeria, Hungary .
They determined — they formed a group, a special group on arbitrary detention. After two years of receiving denunciations by the families of the five and meeting with them, consulting with the U.S. government, receiving back and forth answers, replies and so on, this group determined on May 27th, that their detention was arbitrary, and contrary to the International Civil and Political Rights Covenant and asked the U.S. administration to resolve that situation. If you are arbitrarily and illegally deprived from your freedom, you are kidnapped! The only solution is to free you. What was the U.S. answer? Well, these guys had been convicted by a court of law in Florida. But in August, a superior, a higher court, the 11th circuit of Atlanta, nullified that verdict, reversed those verdicts. Those are their words. And they remanded for a retrial.
When you are not convicted of anything, you’re technically an innocent person. If you are accused eventually, in the future, you are still innocent until a court of law declares you guilty. In this case, they have been declared not guilty, or a court of law, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals, has declared that their conviction, their previous conviction, was invalid, but they have spent seven years in prisons, a large part of it in solitary confinement.
Now we are in a peculiar situation. The U.S. had the possibility to fill an application for — to try asking Atlanta to reverse their decision or to reconsider it. Normally it is a 21 days period. When that period was going to its end, the U.S. asked for an additional month, 30 more days, which is also a possibility, it was granted. That makes 51 days, to consider whether or not to ask for a reconsideration of that decision you referred to regarding the attempted decision to nullify what has happened before. I don’t know if they would really ask for reconsideration of this decision in that case. Probably it wouldn’t be easy because it was a unanimous decision by the three judges in Atlanta. Very categorical decision and a very sound one. It’s a large document, 93 pages, in which, by the way, they recognized and they include a long list — a long list of terrorist acts against Cuba, being committed, organized by people in the Miami area, justifying the mission of these five Cubans.
I don’t know what will happen. But let me tell you this, if there is a new trial, it cannot be a repetition of what was declared null and void by Atlanta. It has to be a different trial. First of all, it has to be elsewhere, out of Florida. In a place where a fair and just handling of the case could take place. But it will be different for other reasons, more important, than the venue. Imagine a new trial after 9/11. Imagine the American people being able to know what was discussed in Miami in that fake judicial process, but even in those circumstances, the five, and their lawyers were able to denounce the terrorist activities taking place from Miami against Cuba. In that process, the government took, very clearly, side with the terrorists. They said that in the indictments against the five during the process.
The problem is that it was not covered by the big media. Only in Miami, people knew that there the government recognized that they were not really spies. In the first day of the actual process, the first hearing in front of the court, the attorney from the District Court of Florida, the attorney — the U.S. Attorney said, ""Don’t expect any secret — any documents being stolen. We’re not going to present anything because nothing these people didn’t take any official documents, any secrets, don’t expect anything"" — that’s there in the transcript. But in the media, they are still identified as spies. Imagine again, having the Generals, the Admirals, the Colonels, retired, very distinguished officials of this government’s armed forces that were witnesses in that trial in Miami, and one by one, under oath all of them said that there is nothing — nothing of espionage involved in this case.
AMY GOODMAN: Why were they in the United States, these men?
RICARDO ALARCON: Well, in some cases, they were called as witnesses by the defense, for example, the former Chief of the Southern Command. Why? Because allegedly, there was espionage in Florida, it affected the Southern Command. Well, let’s have the Chief of the Southern Command. He was there. He expressed his opinion after reviewing the materials. That’s one case. In other cases —
AMY GOODMAN: But I mean, why were the men, the five, what are called the Cuban five, why were they in the United States?
RICARDO ALARCON: Well, they were here for the mission to infiltrate those terrorist groups based in Miami. One of them was apparently a member of the Orlando Bosch group.
AMY GOODMAN: Explain, for people who don’t know who Orlando Bosch is, why you call him a terrorist.
RICARDO ALARCON: Because I am quoting from the U.S. Justice Department report, 1989, June 23, 1989. The U.S. Justice Department, in a written document when Mr. Bosch arrived here in Miami, the Justice Department described his long career as a terrorist in order to determine that that man should be excluded and should be expelled from the U.S. That man is down there in Miami, enjoying life, sunshine, and making speeches.
AMY GOODMAN: What do you think is his worst crime, Orlando Bosch?
RICARDO ALARCON: Well, masterminding the destruction in mid-air of a civilian airplane, killing everybody onboard, together with Mr. Luis Posada Carriles, who is now here in El Paso, Texas. But he has also many other crimes. I think that it is very sad that he has not yet been, as far as I know at least, he has not yet been visited by the F.B.I. to talk about the assassination of Orlando Letelier and Ronni Moffit in Washington D.C.
AMY GOODMAN: The Chilean diplomat.
RICARDO ALARCON: The Chilean diplomat and his American secretary, a young woman that deserves to be alive now, and not to be — not to have his body destroyed by a bomb. Orlando Bosch has never been indicted or interrogated about that. But remember that a few months ago some official documents of the U.S. government that had been classified as secret for many years were declassified. That happened in May and June, approximately, this year. In those — among those documents, there are specific — specific allegations regarding the role of Orlando Bosch in the assassination of Orlando Letelier and Ronni Moffitt.
One report, the U.S. government declassified now — it is not my version — this is not Cuba talking, this one of the U.S. papers, referred to a meeting in Santiago, Chile organized by Orlando Bosch, between one individual, one Cuban from Miami, who was later accused of being one of the material authors of the killing — a meeting in Santiago, Chile organized by Orlando Bosch, with this man and the DINA, the secret police of Pinochet in which — I don’t have the paper with me, but I am almost quoting the text, in which the assassination of Letelier was decided, or agreed upon.
A few months later, a few days after Orlando was actually assassinated in Washington, according to another report, now declassified, in Caracas at a public gathering, a kind of a fund raising dinner, Mr. Orlando Bosch is quoted by a U.S. official in that report — is quoted as saying, ""We did a very good job,"" more or less, ""with Letelier. Now we are going to do something else."" Mr. Posada, who was there in attendance, also, according to the same report, elaborated a little bit further regarding this new event. He said, ""Now we’re going to attack a Cuban airplane, and Bosch knows the details.""
It is very — a new trial of the five out of Florida, after the legitimate outrage and concern that the American people has now, the new awareness regarding terrorists, I really — I am eager to see how the U.S. Attorney now repeats what they said in Miami. How will they explain to the American people their insistence at the Miami trial of not only imposing the harshest sentences to each of the five, but also developing a very peculiar concept of what they call ""incapacitation"". Meaning by that, to make sure that the accused person, after serving his sentence, whatever it may have been, and recovering freedom — After you serve your sentence, you are a normal person. You are supposed to have all of the same rights of any other citizen. No, these people will have a specific limitation requested by the U.S. Government and it’s in written form in December, 2001, Amy, three months after 9/11, in December, 2001, five members of the U.S. Attorney’s office in the Southern District of Florida requesting the incapacitation of these people in order that they could not try again to do what brought them here on trial. Those are their words.
How was that reflected in the sentence? Well, Rene Gonzales, a U.S. citizen by birth got 15 years, a 15 year prison term plus certain conditions after serving the 15 years. One of them, the following — and I would tell you exactly word by word. I know them by heart. As a special condition for his supervised release, the accused is forbidden to get closer to visit specific places where individuals or groups such as terrorists are known to be or frequent.
That means that in December, 2001, three months after 9/11, the authorities of this country knew where individuals or groups that they themselves identify as terrorists, were or move around. Instead of going after the terrorists, they prohibited a U.S. citizen to get around them in order to fight terrorists or to protect the terrorists. Remember that in 9/11, in the attacks against the — here in New York in particular, most of the individuals who took part in that action were trained in Florida, were trained there. They were living in the same area practicing how to use an airplane as a weapon, as a terrible weapon, as they did in 9/11, 2001. But the F.B.I. was not after them. The F.B.I. was very busy after the five, after people who did that anti-terrorist mission in Florida.
Imagine new trial now — I am really eager to see that, how the U.S. will explain itself now, and it will be also very interesting from the point of view of the media if I were a defense lawyer, I would call as a witness Mr. Orlando Bosch, I would call Luis Posada Carriles. My God, he’s mentioned in the other judgment, but in that the previous process, Mr. Posada was hiding in Central America. You know his story, but now he’s under U.S. custody. It’s very easy. Just bring him to wherever that new trial will take place. He may have some interesting comments about the Atlanta decision who refers to his long history of — and he’s here under the U.S. custody. If the U.S. doesn’t send him to Venezuela to be tried for the bombing, then it’s an excellent occasion to air that question here.
Also, I would call as witnesses, those officials that are referred to in those papers, now declassified. They knew — they said officially in these documents that has not been evaluated in front of a court of law, that would be a magnificent opportunity. I mentioned Letellier, and Ronni Moffitt because that crime happened here. Many other acts of terror had taken place here, many of them in Miami. As a matter of fact, more than in any other place.

Kindle first impression
Amazon was fast, and I already got my Kindle. Well, after having paid $32.96 for shipping that was kind of to be expected. As the Kindle uses ""eInk"", a passive display, it came with instructions on what to do already shown on the screen: Plug the charger in, and start. That was extremely easy, and worked right away. Everything you need is pre-installed, that is if you buy your own Kindle from your own Amazon account, the account is already set up correctly for you on the device. Thus within minutes you can buy your first book from the Kindle store, and start reading. The controls on the Kindle are also very user-friendly and intuitive. No complaints here.
I bought the Kindle Keyboard 3G, with free 3G connectivity. For browsing the Amazon store, buying and downloading books that works like a charm. Thus not only is it possible to read on the Kindle on the beach (the eInk works even under sunlight), you can even buy a book while on the beach if you run out of reading material. Unfortunately the web browser of the international version of the Kindle is extremely limited: The only web sites you can reach in 3G mode are Amazon and Wikipedia. The rest is blocked with a message saying ""Due to local restrictions web browsing is not available for all countries"". So the 3G internet works, but is artificially hobbled to prevent you from using the free 3G for actual internet surfing. Too bad! The Kindle web browser *does* work over WiFi. For example my blog is perfectly readable on the Kindle.
After the Kindle was completely charged, I put it back into its box, and gave the box to my wife for safe-keeping until Christmas. At Christmas I will receive the Kindle as a gift from her. I just had to see if it works first. If you think it is weird that I buy my own Christmas presents, you probably haven't been married for long. Most of my presents for her are also things we bought together with her choosing exactly what she wanted. As I doubt that I will have the time for reading books before the Christmas holidays anyway, the Kindle makes for a nice Christmas present for me.",en,unknown

"Michigan vs. Ohio State: Twitter Reaction, Postgame Recap and Analysis
The Ohio State Buckeyes got off to a fast start and held on for the thrilling 56-53 win at home. The loss was the first of the season for the No. 2-ranked Michigan Wolverines.
There are now no unbeaten teams in Division I NCAA basketball.
The Wolverines fought back from a 20-point deficit to tie the game on two occasions late, but they didn't have the final push to pull out the tough road victory.
This was a great game to watch and served as a preview of things to come in the Big Ten Tournament and March Madness in general.
Here is a balanced account of what took place at the Value City Arena in Columbus, Ohio.
Michigan assistant coach Bacari Alexander gave this pregame speech to his team before the loss to the Buckeyes on Sunday.
The Wolverines came into the game as the nation's last undefeated team, and everyone wanted to know if this was the day the ""0"" would go. That includes ESPN's Jay Williams:
This game had several qualities. The sweet alley-oop plays were just one aspect:
The Wolverines battled back from a 20-point deficit to tie the game, and that resiliency made this a regular-season gem:
And #Michigan has tied the game! WOW. We got a game!— ESPN College BBall (@ESPNCBB) January 13, 2013
ESPN's college hoops Twitter feed delivers the news:

How the Buckeyes Won This Game
16-0 Run Early in the First Half
Perhaps the Wolverines were overconfident heading into this game. It is possible the speech from Alexander didn't help matters.
In any case, they didn't look as though they were ready to match the Buckeyes' intensity.
With strong and aggressive defense, the Buckeyes built a huge lead on a strength of a 16-0 run. After Trey Burke started the game with a three-pointer, the Wolverines found themselves down 16-3 shortly thereafter.
Part of the product of the Buckeyes defense was a plethora of turnovers from Michigan. The Buckeyes harassed the Wolverines into 13 miscues, with nine coming in the first half.
Coming into the game, Michigan was averaging just nine giveaways per game.
Wolverines Should Have Played Zone From the Beginning
The Buckeyes have only one dependable scorer in the half court, and that is Deshaun Thomas. Michigan starting the game in man-to-man coverage allowed Thomas to get off early, as they didn't have a defender who could contain him.
He finished with 20 points, and the other Buckeyes who excelled offensively got most of their buckets in transition.
No other Buckeye had double figures in the game.
Aaron Craft and Sam Thompson each had nine points, but seven of Craft's points came in the first half.
The Wolverines' eventual switch to a zone midway through the first half keyed the comeback, but the Buckeyes had already gained momentum.
Heroes and Goats
Heroes: Deshaun Thomas and Sam Thompson
Thomas continues to prove he is a prime-time scorer and leader. He made several big shots en route to another impressive scoring performance.
Thompson's energy on defense led to crowd-igniting slams and constant pressure on the ball.
Goat: Trey Burke
Burke's NBA draft stock took a hit in this game.
He didn't display a ton of poise, struggling to get his team into the offense. He also didn't shoot well, as Craft's tenacious defense seem to bother him all game. This led to a few questionable shots.
Burke finished with 15 points and four assists, but he only shot 4-of-13 from the field, and he committed four turnovers.
He was not as good as his team needed him to be.
Michigan showed a lot of heart in coming back, and it nearly won this game. However, the Wolverines showed that their inexperience can be their undoing.
They were not prepared for the intensity this rivalry game brought, and the atmosphere consumed them early. They must grow up quickly if they plan on going deep into the NCAA tournament.
The Buckeyes scored a huge win at home, but their lack of offensive options will hurt them against top teams. That will be a bigger factor when they aren't playing at home.
That said, their tough defense will keep them in most any game.

"Demetrious Johnson vs. John Dodson: What Went Wrong for Dodson?
On Saturday night in the United Center in Chicago, the UFC flyweight championship was on the line as Demetrious Johnson defended against Ultimate Fighter winner John Dodson. The battle was fast-paced, as expected, although few would have guessed that Demetrious Johnson would be dropped three times in the opening frames of his first title defense.
However, in Round 3, everything turned around for ""The Magician,"" and 15 minutes later, he saw Johnson have his arm raised as Bruce Buffer announced ""Mighty Mouse"" as the bout's winner.
So what went wrong for John Dodson?
Lack of Killer Instinct
In Round 2, Dodson scored a four-punch combination that dropped Johnson hard. All signs pointed to a new champion; however, the challenger apparently couldn't smell the blood in the water.
Instead of pressing the action and unleashing a flurry of strikes on his downed opponent, Dodson allowed Johnson to return to his feet and gave him a moment to recover.
Later in the frame, he landed another big shot that sent Mighty Mouse down, and this time he charged forward. However, this opening wasn't as good as the previous one, and Johnson was quickly back to his feet.
If the ""what if's"" in your life are going to haunt you in your senior years, there is no question that Dodson will always wonder what would have been if he had put his foot on the gas at a time that demanded it.
Conditioning Not Enough for Five Rounds
How many pitchers do you see take the mound and throw fastballs over and over again for nine full innings?
The reason that John Dodson faded after Round 3 lies in the fact that he throws a lot of haymakers. The flyweight has never had cardio issues in previous bouts, but then again, this is the first time that heavy-handed speedster went into championship rounds.
When Dodson couldn't keep his foot on the gas any longer, Johnson kept the pressure at a maximum and used superior technique to do a lot of damage up against the cage.
Demetrious Johnson Has Too Much Heart
Some may look at Johnson vs. Dodson as a flyweight version of Frankie Edgar vs. Gray Maynard. The challenger has heavy hands and used them well in the early rounds. The champion recognizes the terrible situation that surrounds him and refuses to relinquish his belt.
Anyone who witnessed Johnson's fight with Joseph Benavidez saw exactly what his determination can accomplish. Benavidez secured a deep guillotine choke that should have ended the fight; however, the pure will of Johnson gave him the strength to frantically wiggle free and save himself.
That same determination saw Johnson test his own limits and drown Dodson in deep waters for the final rounds.
In any event, this was a great performance for John Dodson. He represented The Ultimate Fighter well and gave reason for viewers to believe that the show can still deliver championship fighters.
Unfortunately for The Magician, it was Johnson who proved himself the better man. With some quality performances in 2013 and a little bit of luck, he could find himself in title contention once again in early 2014.

"Washington Nationals: Are They Better Than the Atlanta Braves?
Patrick McDermott/Getty Images
The Washington Nationals were perceived as locks to win the National League East after another strong offseason. However, after the Atlanta Braves acquired Justin Upton from the Arizona Diamondbacks, there is now a debate as to which team is better.
Yet, despite the Braves' big splash, the Nationals are still the superior team.
Let’s start by looking at each team’s lineups. The Braves' top of the lineup will likely consist of Andrelton Simmons, Jason Heyward and Justin Upton. This group has a lot of potential and talent, but there will be questions about consistency.
The Nationals on the other hand, have Denard Span, Jayson Werth and Ryan Zimmerman leading things off. These guys have a lot of experience, but Werth and Zimmerman have been declining over the past two years. Span gives the Nationals a true leadoff hitter they’ve sorely needed.
Freddie Freeman will be the cleanup hitter for the Braves, followed by B.J. Upton and Dan Uggla. The problem here is that Upton and Uggla are low-contact, high-strikeout hitters. However, with all of the opportunities they will get with men on base, expect the duo to have bounce-back seasons.
The Nationals have Adam LaRoche, Bryce Harper and Ian Desmond at the four, five and six spots. Washington chose LaRoche over Michael Morse, and for good reason. In each of his last two full seasons, LaRoche has had 100 RBI and over 60 extra-base hits.
Harper has the highest upside out of any National, and will look to follow a solid rookie year with an electric sophomore campaign. Desmond had his best season last year, but the Nationals have to be a little concerned about his injury problems.
Who Will Win the NL East This Season?
The seventh spot in each team’s lineup is rather strong. Brian McCann is widely regarded as one of the best offensive catchers in baseball, even if he had a disappointing season in 2012. Danny Espinosa strikes out a lot and has a low average, but he steals bases and has excellent power for a middle infielder.
Finally, the Braves have a below-average hitter in Juan Francisco batting before the pitcher, and the Nationals have a promising catcher in Wilson Ramos.
Both lineups are amongst the best in the league. But while Atlanta is more of a streaky hitting team, the evolution of Harper will make the Nationals' lineup a threat to every pitcher they face.
Additionally, both teams have elite bullpens. Craig Kimbrel is one of the most dominant pitchers in baseball and is more than a formidable option for the Braves in the ninth inning. Jonny Venters and Eric O’Flaherty took a step back last year, but with the addition of fireballer Jordan Walden, the Braves' top relievers will be able to have more rest throughout the season.
The Nationals already had a late-inning combination of Drew Storen and Tyler Clippard before they signed Rafael Soriano. Now they boast three great right-handed relievers.
The problem with the Nationals' bullpen is that they don’t have an effective left-handed reliever, unless you want to count Zach Duke. The Braves, on the other hand, have a good mix of relievers that can handle any situation presented.
However, the biggest advantage that either of these teams have on one another is the Nationals' starting pitching. Stephen Strasburg and Gio Gonzalez are already one of the top duos in the MLB; adding Dan Haren and Jordan Zimmermann to the mix gives Washington arguably the best starting rotation in the majors.
The Braves have Tim Hudson as their ace. Hudson has injury concerns, but he’s been a reliable pitcher over the past couple of seasons. Kris Medlen was a force for the Braves down the stretch last year; if the Braves have any chance of winning the NL East, they’ll need Medlen to maintain a similar performance.
The rest of the Braves' rotation includes Mike Minor, Paul Maholm and Julio Teheran. Those three certainly make the Braves' starting rotation weaker than the Nationals, even if Ross Detwiler is their fifth starter.
The Nationals simply have more talent and depth. Even though the Braves have a better bullpen, I think that Davey Johnson will manage his pen better than Fredi Gonzalez. This division race will be close, but the Nationals will pull away in the last few weeks of September.

During the opening sequence when the Willem Dafoe character is shown printing money the film crew is actually creating counterfeit bills. They had a convicted counterfeiter on set showing them how it is done. They were filming out in the desert and Willem Dafoe said that every time a helicopter flew over the building they were sure it was the police coming to arrest them all. See more »

A Gritty, Anti-Buddy Police Thriller With A Welcome Mean Streak
Another critic discussing this film accurately mentioned ""being shamefully ignored"" as an injustice this 1985 William-Friedkin masterpiece suffered upon its release. And it was not only the critics who failed to notice its worth. For some reason, the public stayed away in droves as well, this as myself and my friend were practically organizing tours to the theater, introducing people to the film who, weened on ""48 Hours"", ""Miami Vice"" and yet to experience the Abbott & Costello hijinks of the ""Lethal Weapon"" series, had little concept of what a below-the-belt, impeccably crafted cop movie could be. Or would turn into.
Those who've seen Friedkin's earlier genre entry ""The French Connection"" shouldn't be caught off guard by his often ruthless tactics here, as he's back in the familiar territory of cops and criminals. Nor should those who survived his muscular ""Sorcerer""--another unsung hero of an action piece--be unprepared for the director's inability to hide the more challenging (and dreadful) sides of male conflict. Even the disturbing ""Cruising"", where no attempts were made by the film to explain its ugly corkscrew of a story, all the while summoning an atmosphere thick with dread, still suspenseful, but full of plot holes conveniently filled with leather jackets and the scariest Village-People-on-PCP-soundtrack to date, is just another Friedkin descent into Hell. The details always more than part of a whole.
It may show the surface of a genre flick, but beneath the pulsing Wang Chung soundtrack and 80s-reflective duds (no Members Only jackets appear, luckily) there is as lean and mean and taut a suspense thriller as even Don Siegel could deliver in his prime. And with an outstanding, hyper-realistic cast of then unknowns--including Chicago theater alumni William Pederson, pre-""CSI"" and with even more cock to his walk, swaggering through his pursuit of a damaged counterfeiter, Willem Dafoe--the screws tighten with each and every action sequence, climaxing the building mayhem with a cathartic, freeway massacre of automotive chaos on the same scale as a ""Mad Max"" movie.
The characters ar caustic, the betrayals extremely violent, the music pounding, the ending, in particular, is a departure from the Gerald Petievich novel, the author, himself, a retired U.S. Treasury agent writing an even bleaker resolution to the problem of two unstable detectives at odds with each other, losing their sanity, and finding no comfort in their escalating criminal misbehavior. ""To Live And Die In LA"" marks a significant and welcome departure within such an oversaturated genre, the buddy cop movie. It refuses to soften its blows or coddle its audience, showing instead dangerous, volatile situations being taken serious. Brutally serious.
Nonetheless, for all its nihilistic tone, captured in parched images of a city populated by thugs, thieves, and sociopathic criminals, ""To Live And Die In LA"" is like a breath of fresh smog.

"Keep Your Shoes On
Once you find shoes that fit well, wear them all the time. Don't go barefoot, even around your own house. ""Some patients, when they are numb, may walk on a piece of glass and not be aware of it,"" says UCLA podiatric surgeon Robert K. Lee, DPM.
Podiatrists suggest that people with diabetes even put on shoes if they take a few steps to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night. There's always a chance you could step on something, not feel it, and injure yourself.
Enjoy Occasional Fancy Feet
Having diabetes doesn't always mean you're limited to sensible, comfortable footwear every day for the rest of your life.
""The need for being careful depends on how advanced the neuropathy is,"" says Lee. ""The risks vary significantly depending on how advanced the disease is and how numb or how bad circulation is."" If you have normal sensation and circulation, it may be OK to wear normal shoes -- even dressy shoes like high heels or pointy wingtips -- for short periods of time, says Lee.
Check with your podiatrist for advice about your particular case.",en,reference

"Daryl Johnston: Understanding Roles of Our FBs in the Chargers Offense
I got into a little debate with a Raider fan a long time ago. The debate was based on a article I wrote awhile back appropriately named ""Pick Your Poison: A Look at the 2010 Chargers Offensive Arsenal"". In that article, I named Jacob Hester and Mike Tolbert as part of the Chargers offensive weapons. This Raider fan, from what I gather, didn't know much about the Chargers offense, so I decided to write this article on why these guys are weapons.
If there is ever a indication of what Tolbert and Hester's worth to the Chargers offense, we'll have to take a step back in time to the first player that made that position what it is today. That player is Daryl Johnston.
If it wasn't for Daryl Johnston, there would be no FB vote in the Pro Bowl today. What he did was nothing short of extraordinary as he was one of the most dynamic players in the game.
Dynamic, not versatile.
People get those two words confused all the time. He wasn't lined up all over the place but what he did was pass-block, run-block, run with the ball, and catch the ball out of the backfield. That's dynamic.
Why can I look at Daryl Johnston as a indication of what Tolbert and Hester can hopefully be? Because the one person that orchestrated the Cowboys offense in which Daryl Johnston flourished in is none other than the current Head Coach for the San Diego Chargers.
Johnston was a ordinary FB during his first two years in the NFL. Turner came in and turned him into a viable weapon in the passing game or running game whether he's the runner, pass-catching receiver, or blocker.
During Turner's time as the offensive coordinator, he installed his version of the Vertical Offense. Johnston had 54 yards rushing , averaging 3.2 yards per carry, and 28 receptions for 244 yards in his first season. During his second season, he improved in the new offense with 61 yards rushing, averaging 3.6 yards per carry, and 32 receptions for 249 yards. In his third season, he went on to have 74 rushing yards, averaging 3.1 yards per carry, and 50 receptions for 372 yards.
He wasn't the main weapon on the Cowboys offense, but he was the person that made everyone better. He gave the QB extra time. He helped a young Emmitt Smith gained massive amounts of yardage in the running game. He helped the Cowboys move the ball in the passing game.
These are the same attributes that can be found in both Tolbert and Hester for the San Diego Chargers. If you look at what they did in a combined effort in the FB position, you can see how Turner is using them to help the Chargers offense move the ball in much of the same way Turner helped the Cowboys move the ball.
Both Tolbert and Hester been in the league for two seasons, all with the Chargers. Both Tolbert and Hester combined at the FB position had 132 yards rushing, averaging 4.1 yards per carry, and 25 receptions for 262 yards in their first season. In their second season together, Tolbert and Hester combined for 222 yards rushing, averaging 4.8 yards per carry, and 26 receptions for 216 yards.
Now, you can see that the Chargers FB's play a important role on the team in being very dynamic. It gives the Chargers a lot more options during a game. Defenses might look at the RB, TE, and WR of the Chargers only to neglect their FB as a viable threat to keep the drive alive. This is what the FB's can do for the Chargers.
It's still early in both Mike Tolbert and Jacob Hester's career, but after seeing what Daryl Johnston did in Turner's offense, I think it's safe to say that both Tolbert and Hester are just as much weapons to their team as Johnston was to his.

"We heard earlier this week that Cuban free agent Jorge Soler wanted bids on his services in by Thursday. Several teams watched him work out on Wednesday, and then Thursday came and went with no news on bids.
Now we know why! Buster Olney:
The next rounds of bids are due on free agent outfielder Jorge Soler this weekend, according to sources.
The Cubs have invested the most time in getting to know Soler, but the Dodgers might be a wildcard, because of the team’s new ownership and commitment to the international market, according to sources.
It doesn’t say when this weekend, so if you are a fan of one of the teams involved, you’ll want to pay close attention. No matter when the bids do get in, there is one deadline that won’t change:
Soler has until July 2 to sign a contract under previous collective bargaining agreement. Under those rules, teams can bid any amount they wish for a foreign player. After that date, the new rules will prohibit bids more than $2.9 million.
Since the bids on Soler are rumored to be as much as $25 million to $35 million, you can bet that deadline will be adhered to.",en,web
"We chose Carnival of Souls as our Halloween WinterHaven Book Club pick for this month. After having a great time reading and discussing this novel by Melissa Marr, we've put together a few highlights about our conversation. Enjoy!
On a scale of 1 - 5 how perfect was this book for Halloween?Amber- I'd say it's a 5.
Arlene-I will definitely give this book a 5. It has daimons, witches, curs, scabs, and all sorts of paranormal fun to make this a perfect pick for Halloween.
Crystal-Definitely 5 plus some!!
Would you recommend this book to our ghoulish readers?Arlene-Well I’m an avid Melissa Marr fan so this might come off a bit biased but HALE YEAH I recommend this book to our ghoulish readers. This book is signature perfect of what Marr is capable of delivering. Her dark, poetic prose captivates me every.single.time. I love her world building and how she crafts her lore. So, absolutely, I definitely recommend this to paranormal fans.
Crystal-I would recommend it with every fiber of my being!! This book was amazing!
Do you think Adam should have shared more with Mallory about who and what she really was?
Crystal-I do, I wish he would have had more faith in her ability to handle it all.. He expected her to grow up and defend herself so she should have, at least in my opinion, had the full honest story. I think it would have made her stronger.
Amber-I think he could have grown a set and told her earlier. On the other hand, I understand his hesitation.
Arlene- Do I think he should have share more with Mallory… yes. Do I understand why he didn’t… absolutely. I really came to care for Adam in this book. He sacrificed so much to protect Mallory as best he could. I think as with everything else in life… you make choices that you feel are best for those you love and he definitely showed that he loved Mallory more than anything. I don’t agree with some of the things he did to protect her, but I most certainly understood that he did it with good intentions.
In a fight between Kaleb and Aya who do you think would win?
Amber-If Aya could use her ""special skills"" I'd say hands down Aya.
Arlene-If I were betting with my heart, I’d say Kaleb. If I were betting with my money, I’d say Aya. There’s no doubt that Kaleb is a fighter and he’s been put to the test of survival more than his fair share. However, you’ve got someone as ruthless, cunning and wickedly badarse like Aya so when it comes down to it, I think it would be a worthy fight but my money would be on Aya.
Crystal-Aya without a doubt! She is ruthless and a complete badarse!!
Who was the creepiest or coolest character in the book?
Crystal-Creepiest would have to go Zevi for me. There is just something about him that creeps me out. I love how devoted he is to Kaleb, but I think he is hiding something. Coolest for me is Belias. I love him! I love Aya too, but Belias is just awesome =D
Amber-Creepiest would be Evelyn and the coolest, I'd say Aya. I really liked her.
Freezer or read in the dark by a window material?Crystal-I am going to say read in the dark by a window.
Amber-Read in the dark by a window.
Arlene- I would say read in the dark by a window. How cool would be it be look out the window while I was reading, into the dark night and see right down the street from my house a Watcher spews black crows from her mouth!! That would be pretty awesome!!
We hope you enjoyed our Carnival of Souls discussion!",en,web
"A Red State uprising?
No, it’s not a call to anarchy or revolution. Just a little uprising.
That’s the intent behind the book Erick Erickson, managing editor of RedState.com, has signed on to write for Regnery Press.
On its Amazon page, the book called “Red State Uprising” asks those fed up with an “arrogant federal government” to join the uprising. Erickson promises to deliver a plan “to take back the people’s government” and to bring change to Washington. He wants to bring government down to its right size to ensure economic growth, individual liberty and private property rights.
As the Amazon page says, “Barack Obama has shown his determination to move the country towards a socialist nanny state, culminating in the government takeover of health care.” The book is due in the fall.
Early this month, Erickson got a little heated over the government census, saying if a census worker wanted to enter his house to interview him for the 2010 count he would brandish his wife’s shotgun.
On RedState radio, he said: ""This is crazy. What gives the Commerce Department the right to ask me how often I flush my toilet? Or about going to work? I'm not filling out this form. I dare them to try and come throw me in jail. I dare them to. Pull out my wife's shotgun and see how that little ACS twerp likes being scared at the door. They're not going on my property. They can't do that. They don't have the legal right, and yet they're trying.""
He clarified his comments later in a RedState.com post, insisting “the left is out today saying I was on the air advocating killing census workers,” and that misconstrued his words.
RedState.com bills itself as ""the largest online community of conservative activists and the most widely read right of center blog on Capitol Hill."" Erickson, an attorney who worked at a Georgia law firm for several years, now edits RedState.com out of his home in Macon.

"You Remember the Name
Blue + Blue Law. The name sounds familiar, doesn't it? Jason Blue was the former CEO of the law firm of Wolske & Blue, which was one of the most prominent personal injury firms in Ohio. Jason and his son, Douglas Blue, formed their own firm in 2000, which is now known as Blue + Blue Law. Although the name has changed, the commitment to standing up for the rights of accident victims remains the same.
Over the course of more than 64 years spent getting justice and compensation for victims of negligence, our firm has become one of the most respected in Ohio. This respect is evident in the leadership positions held in prominent legal organizations and industry recognitions that include:
- Ohio Chapter of the American Board of Trial Advocates
- Ohio Academy of Trial Lawyers
- Franklin County Trial Lawyers Association
- Member of the Board of Governors of the Association of Trial Lawyers of America
- Super Lawyers
- Central Ohio Top Lawyers
The Insurance Companies Remember the Name Too
Insurance companies keep track of their opponents. When they see that they are up against a lawyer who has no experience in the courtroom and is likely to accept a settlement, their offer is going to be low. When they are up against a lawyer like Jason or Douglas Blue, a lawyer who knows how to get results at trial, they are more likely to offer a fair settlement.
Why do insurance companies offer better settlements to trial lawyers? It's because they don't want to go to trial. There is too much risk that they could end up paying more than they think they should, especially when the attorneys they are up against have a record like ours.""

"Since many people’s attention are glued in the ongoing drama of Chief Justice Renato Corona’s Impeachment trial, I thought of making side steps and taking the spotlight into a much lighter yet still entertaining topic.
We all know that Bourne Legacy has just finished filming in the country. Present here were its lead stars Jeremy Renner and Rachel Weisz. This only proved that our country is a great filming location that Hollywood film makers are coming here to shoot their masterpiece. Who would not be proud knowing that in so many countries they’ve chosen our country to film their movies and it means a lot, especially that our government is aggressive in its efforts and campaigns to increase our tourist arrivals.

Diet And Acne: For A Clearer Complexion, Cut The Empty Carbs
If you're prone to outbreaks of acne, you may want to try cutting back on empty carbs and sweets. Researchers are revisiting the connections between diet and pimples, and a growing body of evidence suggests that eating a diet rich in high glycemic index foods may be tied to flare-ups.
""High glycemic index foods are typically processed foods, high in white flour,"" explains nutrition researcher Jennifer Burris of New York University. Examples include white bread, pasta, crackers and white rice. The glycemic index is basically a system of measuring how fast your blood sugar rises after eating a specific amount of carbohydrates, so sugary foods such as soda, juice and candy bars are all on the list, too.
In a paper published in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, Burris and her colleagues review 27 studies on nutrition and acne. Some of the more convincing evidence comes from a few recent studies of teenagers and young men (aged 15-25 years) who had acne. After the participants followed a low-glycemic-load diet, researchers documented decreases in inflammatory acne lesions. The studies were small, but the findings were significant.
So what explains this connection? Researchers say foods that spike blood sugar can also increase hormones. The hormones can stimulate oil production, which in turn, can trigger acne. ""It's like a domino effect,"" says Burris.
Burris and her colleagues say more research is needed to nail down cause and effect between eating high-glycemic-load foods and developing acne. So far, the studies point to a correlation. (The research also hinted that dairy products might be a trigger.)
Still, it's interesting that after years of dermatologists dissing the notion that diet and acne are linked, there's new thinking on this question.
""It's hard to dismiss what a patient is saying,"" says Dr. William Rietkerk, a New York-based dermatologist who is a co-author on the new paper. He says his patients often come in saying things like, ""I ate a lot of junk food this week and now my face is breaking out."" It's a connection that paleo-diet gurus have embraced, too.
Rietkerk says there are lots of factors involved in acne. In addition to diet, stress is also a likely part of the equation. But he says it's important to understand more about how the foods we eat influence the risk — or severity — of acne, especially since it's a condition affecting more than 17 million Americans.
Theories about diet and acne have a long history. Going back to the 1800s, dermatology textbooks frequently recommended dietary restrictions as a form of treatment. And as early as 1931, researchers had discovered links between acne and carbs and impaired glucose tolerance (as some of the newer studies have documented as well).
And what about the old advice to steer clear of chocolate? Back in 1969, a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association dispelled the association between chocolate and acne. But ""this study was flawed,"" Rietkerk and Burris write in their paper.
Why? Well, as part of the study, participants with mild to moderate acne consumed either a milk chocolate bar or a placebo (a bar without chocolate) every day for a specific period of time. At the end of the study, the researchers determined that chocolate did not affect acne development. So, cocoa? It may be off the hook.
But, since the placebo bar had just as much sugar as the chocolate bar, perhaps it was the sugar that was exacerbating the acne. Or maybe the way the researchers measured the outcomes was not very precise. Burris says it's just not clear what the true connection between chocolate and acne might be. She points to the flaws in the chocolate study as an example of why it's important to take a new look at the old assumptions about diet and acne.",en,reference

"At Gartner's Symposium/ITxpo, Sun CEO Scott McNealy preached the new Sun gospel of grid computing powered by Sun's N1 Grid.
ORLANDO, Fla.Speaking to a near capacity crowd of IT executives at Gartner Inc.s Gartner Symposium/ITxpo here on Monday, Sun Microsystems Inc.s CEO Scott McNealy preached the new Sun gospel of grid computing powered by Suns N1 Grid.
""We want to move customers to a managed service,"" said McNealy. ""We do it much better than IBM and [Hewlett-Packard Co.]. Well still build really a great customized box for you if you want, but wed prefer if you just used our truck.""
When asked by Gartners Managing Vice President Paul McGuickin and Vice President Laura McLellan for more detail, McNealy explained that Suns new subscription plan, powered by the forthcoming Solaris 10, will give users the computing power they need at a price they can afford and without having to worry about the underlying technology.
Going back to his truck metaphor, which he used throughout his presentation, McNealy said of Suns N1 Grid vision, ""Its like a car with a V6, V8 or diesel. Do you really care when you need to go? No, you just step on the gas.""
Customers will buy into this subscription model using what McNealy calls a ""call plan."" With these call plans, customers will pay for only those CPU hours and storage they need when they need it. ""But,"" he said with a smile, ""we will bill you by rounding up to the next hour.""
This plan is more than just an infrastructure plan. McNealy wants customers to not only host edge services and application servers on the grid, but ""we want to host and run your desktop on the N1 Grid.""
When asked what was the difference between this and IBMs old time-sharing on a mainframe plan, McNealy replied, ""[Its] back to the future, only better."" This, he explained is because of Suns open infrastructure, which will be powered for the most part by Solaris 10 and Java Web services. Solaris 10, in particular, McNealy noted is a necessity for raising productivity.
McNealy was candid, though, in admitting that to make this plan attractive with its introductory pricing of $1 per CPU hour and 80 cents per gigabyte of storage, Sun is going to cannibalize its own product sales. ""Id rather we cannibalize ourselves rather than have someone else do it,"" said McNealy.
Of course, Suns sales force has been very comfortable selling boxes, ""SPARC and Solaris, SPARC and Solaris"" is the companys slogan, said McLellan.
""Were having to retrain,"" McNealy said.
Sun is also changing its internal sales plan. ""We now compensate our salespeople the same regardless of the hardware they sell. If they sell software on a Dell machine, then theyre compensated just as if they had sold a SPARC machine,"" he said.

"CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (AP) — Reggie Bullock scored 23 points to help North Carolina beat Wake Forest 87-62 on Tuesday night.
James Michael McAdoo added 20 points for the Tar Heels (16-6, 6-3 Atlantic Coast Conference), who have won six of seven since an 0-2 league start. North Carolina put together a 24-5 run spanning halftime to blow the game open and take a 25-point lead on the way to an easy home win. The Tar Heels shot 52 percent and scored 26 points off turnovers to beat Wake Forest for the fourth straight time.
North Carolina led by 20 points at halftime and by 34 points after the break.
Freshman Devin Thomas had 11 points and 13 rebounds for the Demon Deacons (10-12, 3-7), who have lost four straight and six of seven. Wake Forest shot 44 percent but committed 21 turnovers to keep giving the ball right back to the Tar Heels.
Wake Forest hasn't won since its 86-84 upset of North Carolina State two weeks ago. It had played well at home but poorly on the road since that game, taking Duke to the final minutes in a close home loss yet losing at Georgia Tech and Maryland by a combined 46 points.
This one didn't go any better.
The Demon Deacons constantly gave the ball away in a barrage of turnovers that the Tar Heels were all too eager to convert into points. Wake Forest finished the first half with more turnovers (13) than field goals (9), while the Tar Heels converted those miscues into 18 points that helped them shoot 62 percent (18 of 29) in the first 20 minutes.
The Tar Heels held Wake Forest without a field goal for nearly 6 minutes to end the half during a 15-1 run that pushed the lead to double figures. Bullock scored seven in that flurry, including a straightaway 3-pointer that caught the front of the rim, bounced softly into the air and dropped through the net just before the horn for a 47-27 halftime lead.
Then, after consecutive baskets from Thomas, the Tar Heels ran off nine straight points to take a 56-31 lead on Marcus Paige's transition layup with 16:49 left.
Wake Forest got no closer than 21 points the rest of the night.
It was the first time this year that Bullock and McAdoo — UNC's top two players — both reached 20 points in the same game. It was also a single-game scoring high for the Tar Heels in an ACC game this season.
P.J. Hairston added 11 points for the Tar Heels in his first game back from a concussion. The sophomore guard was hurt when he collided with teammate Dexter Strickland last week at Boston College, then sat out of last weekend's overtime win against Virginia Tech.
Hairston had also been battling a flu-like bug since Sunday night, prompting coach Roy Williams to say Monday that Hairston was doubtful and ""highly unlikely"" to play against Wake Forest. But Hairston was cleared to return from the concussion before tipoff, then participated in pregame warm-ups before entering the game to loud cheers with 14:58 left in the opening half.
Hairston hit a pair of 3-pointers in 12 minutes.",en,web

"Tennessee just hired the exact opposite of Lane Kiffin, who himself replaced his exact opposite when Phil Fulmer was run out of town. Tennessee fan, meet Derek Dooley, the least exciting hire ever. This doesn’t mean he’ll suck, mind you, just that I can think of about 50 people who would have made a more interesting hire than Dooley.
But the Vols are hoping they’ve remedied the Kiffin Debacle with Dooley: a coach who is perfectly qualified for his job, holds a law degree, was the athletic director and head coach at his previous job, has an SEC pedigree (dad coached at Georgia and Dooley worked for Nick Saban at LSU), cares about integrity and honesty, and has not one flashy bone in his body.
At least when Auburn hired Gene Chizik last year, it made headlines because it was such a hilariously bad hire and because Chizik put together a really good staff (including personal favorite of mine, Gus Malzahn).
Otherwise, all UT did today was hire a guy who used to be a Saban assistant at LSU and went 4-8 this past year at Louisiana Tech. Oh but hey, they won the Independence Bowl in 2008, so you know, Vols fan can relax.
Basically, Tennesee re-hired Phil Fulmer in his early 40′s, only Dooley wasn’t any good as a player and didn’t play at Tennessee. But otherwise all the nondescript-Southern-white-coach traits are there. And maybe that’s the point.
All Tennessee has had is Johnny Majors and Phil Fulmer, who freaking played for Majors. I think UT is done with flashy hires and big talk. They seem to much rather want to be the one SEC program that isn’t talking crazy before they’ve even played a game (I never bought that “crazy like a fox” act from Kiffin) or running some fancy spread offense like those pricks in Starkville and Gainesville.
And I, for one, applaud UT for that. Recruiting was never a problem for Majors, Fulmer, or Kiffin, so there’s no need to get a guy who goes nuts in the press. UT needs Dooley to make his players improve and play better. The system doesn’t matter, just the coach and the kids on the field. Frankly, Lane Kiffin never fit in there anyway.",en,web
"WICKS CELEBRATES DEC. 1 WIN OVER MATER DEI
IT'S NOT THAT Long Beach Poly doesn't have a long-running track record of success on the gridiron. It's just that this season started out so abysmally that no one would have predicted where star back Gerard Wicks and his fellow Jackrabbits find themselves this week: Taking an 11-game winning streak into Friday's state title showdown with Granite Bay High out of Northern California.
Long Beach Poly started the season 1-3 and looked awful in the process, losing games in Weeks 3 and 4 by a combined score of 85-6.
And then the light went on, particularly with their running game, which includes some nifty wildcatting and direct snaps to the backs.

Poly has reeled off 11-straight wins, capturing Southern Section and regional titles along the way, and now is poised for its first state crown since 2008.
They meet Granite Bay this Friday night at the Home Depot Center in Carson. Both teams are 12-3.
Poly's post-season run began in convincing fashion on Nov. 9 when Wicks rushed for 223 yards and two TDs as the Jackrabbits defeated Bishop Amat 40-25. Right after that win, Wicks spent the weekend at Wazzu on his official visit.
Then came a stunning, 21-16 upset of Mission Viejo, which came into the game undefeated and ranked No. 4 in the nation by the MaxPreps computer-based ratings system. Wicks ran for 76 yards and two TDs, and made a statement when he steamrolled Viejo's Max Redfield on one play. The bulldozing was head-turning for two reasons. First, Redfield is a four-star safety considered one of the top college prospects in California and widely believed to be headed to USC or Notre Dame in the fall. And second, Wicks is known more for speed and slash than brute power.
Following that big win, Poly defeated St. John Bosco, mighty Mater Dei and, last week, Clovis North out of Fresno.
In those three games, the 5-11, 190-pound Wicks rushed for a combined 280 yards and two TDs.
Those numbers pushed his season totals to 1,501 rushing yards and 19 TDs.
DON SASA: 1994 FIRST-TEAM ALL-PAC-10, 1995 3RD-ROUND NFL DRAFT PICK.
For insight into just how formidable Poly's offense is, consider that Wicks' partner in the backfield, fullback Manusamoa Luuga, has nearly identical stats as Wicks.
Wicks is rated 3 stars by Scout.com and ranked the No. 79 running back prospect in the nation in the 2013 recruiting class. He verbally committed to WSU in June.
Long Beach Poly has produced more NFL players than high school in the nation. Among those on the list is old Palouse Posse mainstay Don Sasa, who went on to play four seasons in the NFL, mostly with the Chargers, after making his mark at WSU.
In May 2002, Cougar head coach Mike Price set an unofficial WSU (and maybe even NCAA) record when he extended scholarship offers to seven players from the same school in one day. The school was Long Beach Poly.",en,web

The kids call him Spitzer and he runs the Audio /visual department at the school teaching the children about televison ,news commercials with hands on video production. This is high school in 2012 ,but in 1985 I cant remember how many tests I took with a number #2 pencil or technology makes it all interesting these days.

“We were excited to Record WIth Aurther Scott and DMS studios as he helped shape us our sound and he wasn’t afraid to tell us how to record properly and we are happy with the recordings” says Privoda ”I am influenced by pantera and pink floyd , we work hard at practice and , we all believe in knowing what you are playing, not just playing the chords.” Privoda adds. When asked about the 2 absent band members and their thoughts.
Lead Guitarist and vocalist TJ Duncan and Kay-leigh Hicks -keyboard and backing vocals were quick to comment on their bandmates “I respect Max’s View and taste of older metal a, it helps me write (Pic Left to right Hicks, Duncan, Privoda)
“Dalton our guitarist is an amazing player and he is allowing me to tech him more technical thing on gutar all together we play well as a band. Above my head swing a rubber chicken and Hicks chimes in ” They lower the chicken down to let us know to announce lunch menu during news” the room is filled with laughter as we are joined by 2 other local musicans and fans. As I sit their i realize “wow these kids know their stuff ” great musicains playing just as good as the vets local and nationally and they are about to make their mark.Untraced ,not just caring about themselves took this opportunity and invited 2 other students to be interviewed and exposed with our visit.
Not only did they only did they provide a cool enviroment for us to conduct the interview they were not in sharing the airtime.

“How does the notion of scale affect humanities and social science research?
Now that scholars have access to huge repositories of digitized data—far more than they could read in a lifetime—what does that mean for research?”
The description of joint NEH/NSF Digging into Data competition (2009) organized by Office of Digital Humanities at the National Endowment of Humanities (the U.S. federal agency which funds humanities research).
“The next big idea in language, history and the arts? Data.”
New York Time, November 16, 2010.
Over the last few years, digital humanities - use of computational tools for cultural analysis - has been rapidly expanding, with growing number of grants, panels and presentations at conferences, and media coverage. (For example, New York Times is running a series of articles about digital humanities, with 5 articles already in print since November 2010.) However, most of the projects so far focused on text and spatial data (literature and history departments). With a few exceptions, other fields including art history, visual culture, film and media studies, musicology, and new media have yet to start using computational methods. But even in social sciences, the disciplines which are dealing with culture (media studies, cultural sociology, anthropology) and which employ quantitative methods, still did not discover full possibilities of ""cultural computation."" In short: the opportunities are wide open, and it is an exiting time to enter the field.
This graduate seminar explores the concepts, methods, and tools of computational cultural analysis, with a particular focus on the analysis of visual and interactive media. (This is also the focus of our lab's cultural analytics research).
We will discuss cultural, social and technical developments which gave us ""large cultural data"" (digitization by cultural institutions, social media) and which placed ""information"" and ""data"" in the center of contemporary social and economic life (the concepts of information society, network society, software society)
We will critically examine the fundamental paradigms developed by modern and contemporary societies to analyze patterns in data - statistics, visualization, data mining. This will help us to employ computational tools more reflexively. At the same time, the practical work with these tools will help us to better understand how they are used in society at large - the modes of thinking and inquiry they enable, their strengths and weaknesses, the often unexamined assumptions behind their use.
(This approach can be called reflexive digital humanities.)
We will discuss theoretical issues raised by computational cultural analysis: selecting data (single artifacts vs. sample vs. complete population); meanings vs. patterns; analyzing artifacts vs. analyzing cultural processes; methodologies for analyzing interactive media; combining established humanities methods with computational methods.
The course assumes that while computational methods can be used in the service of existing humanities questions and approaches, they also have radical potential to challenge existing concepts and research paradigms, and lead to new types of questions. To engage this potential, we have to start by considering ""contemporary techniques of control, communication, representation, simulation, analysis, decision-making, memory, vision, writing, and interaction"" enabled by software in society at larger. (Manovich, Introduction to Software Takes Command.) Projecting these techniques onto the problem of cultural analysis will tell us what digital humanities can be.
The seminar combines readings, discussion, exercises to learn tools and techniques, and collaborative work in groups to conduct original digital humanities projects. Students will be able to use any of the data sets already assembled by Software Studies Initiative (see examples) as well as the unique supervisualization HIPerSpace system.

KINGSTON, N.J., Feb. 26, 2013 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- Governor Chris Christie appointed Martin Tuchman to a three-year term on the New Jersey Commission on National and Community Service (the ""Commission""). Pursuant to Executive Order 20, the Commission is charged with developing a statewide ethic of community service and a comprehensive, coordinated program targeted to the needs of New Jersey and its unique community challenges. The Commission guides the AmeriCorps program and ensures the effectiveness of its components and seeks to infuse service learning into the primary, secondary, and post-secondary curricula to create future generations of adults committed to community service.
When asked about his other involvement in the State of New Jersey, Mr. Tuchman stated: ""one of my initiatives in the state of New Jersey has been to promote infrastructure rebuilding. My views are well known and have been published in The Times of Trenton. Through the repatriation of overseas funds held by foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies and by assessing a reduced federal tax rate of 5 percent vs. the higher, usual, 35 percent corporate rate, we can bring a substantial amount of money back into the United States to help fund this important requirement. While 70% of the proceeds would be retained by the repatriating corporation, an additional 25% would be retained by the corporation in the form of U.S. Infrastructure Building Bonds. Tuchman stated that New Jersey's share of these bonds would be sufficient to make a significant impact in rebuilding the capital infrastructure ignored for so long.
Irwin Stoolmacher, former Treasurer of the Commission, praised Mr. Tuchman's job creating ability: ""When Mr. Tuchman teamed up with First Choice Bank, a nascent start up, they had 15 employees. Today, with over 500 full-time employees, the Bank has originated over $4 billion of loans and mortgages. I am convinced he'll make a great addition to the Commission.""
Tuchman is involved with various charitable non-profit organizations including the Trenton Area Soup Kitchen on whose Board of Trustees he has served since February 2003. He also serves on the Board of Trustees of the Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital Hamilton and has served on the Board of Managers for the American Cancer Society, Mercer County unit.
Tuchman is dedicated to the funding of Parkinson's disease research. As Chairman of the Tuchman Foundation he works closely with all Parkinson organizations whose scientists select grants seeking National Institute of Health's approval. He also serves as Chairman of the annual Central Park Parkinson's Unity Walk and The Parkinson's Alliance.
Last year Beta Gamma Sigma (BGS), the International Honor Society, serving business programs accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business, awarded Tuchman its coveted 2011 Business Achievement Award which is given annually to recognize ""significant achievements over a career or by a singular achievement that has advanced the field of business and contributed to community and to humankind.""
Tuchman currently serves as Vice Chairman of First Choice Bank in Lawrenceville, New Jersey. He is also Chief Executive Officer of the Tuchman Group which is engaged in real estate, banking and international shipping.

"Trees thought extinct thrive in Kew Gardens
It's not often you have an opportunity to see a living fossil in your own backyard, but in Kew Gardens – about 90 m south of the Gardener’s Cottage and a good roll short of the bowling greens – stands a magnificent group of dawn redwoods that are happily thriving among the oaks and maples. Their gnarled fluted trunks and low-hanging outstretched branches make them look as though they would be more at home in Jurassic Park than a Toronto park. And with good reason – as recently as 1945 these trees were thought to be an extinct species, leaving behind just a few fossilized imprints of their foliage as the only evidence that they ever existed at all.
As a horticulturist and professional gardener, I always marvel at their extraordinary story of re-discovery and usually make a detour on my way to the boardwalk to admire these relics of the dinosaur age. I'm usually not alone – sometimes a dog walker or a jogger happens along to take a look and occasionally a conversation starts, as often happens when you find yourself standing around looking at trees with a stranger. And it's not long before the inevitable question comes: do you know what kind of trees these are?
A distant relative of the well-known giant Sequoias of California, famously seen in those 1950s novelty postcards depicting tourists driving cars through their hollowed out trunks, the dawn redwood (Metasequoia glyptostroboides) has only recently joined the ranks of the few deciduous conifers (along with the Larch and Bald Cypress) that are found in North America. It was named in 1941 by palaeobotanist S. Miki, who had taken on the task of identifying and cataloging plant and foliage remains embedded in a cache of recently unearthed fossils. One particularly interesting sample of tree foliage fascinated Miki and his fellow botanists and they launched an exhaustive investigation to try to match the stone imprints to known living plants. Eventually Miki and his colleagues admitted defeat in their search and the tree was officially declared extinct. He named the samples Metasequoia (literal translation “like a sequoia”) before adding it to the growing pile of lost species.
The story would have ended there if it were not for a Chinese forester who, four years after Miki's re-classification, happened to be surveying a remote area of Sichuan province for relocation sites financed by Chinese clients wary of the increasing Japanese occupation of China. A short time after beginning his exploration of the dense forested interior he stumbled across a village where he immediately noticed a large and unusual looking tree planted in front of a temple. Examining the deep emerald coloured feathered foliage and unusual form and twig arrangement he first thought he had come across a unique variety of cypress (which the redwood closely resembles), but he soon ruled that out after noticing anomalies in the leaf size and structure of the mysterious specimen. The local villagers appeared to have bestowed a religious significance on the temple tree and after noticing his curiosity led him to a small stand of similar trees growing in a densely wooded area nearby. Baffled, he temporarily abandoned his original mission and began collecting foliage samples which he sent to Beijing university for identification. Coincidentally a botanist there had recently read the Miki description of lost species and when he compared the leaf and twig samples to the fossil descriptions they matched perfectly.
Metasequoia glyptostroboides had been brought back from extinction.
Even with the Pacific war in full swing the discovery of an extinct species was big news and word travelled quickly around the world causing great excitement among botanists and the scientific community on both sides of the conflict. As the war came to an end an expedition sponsored by the Arnold Arboretum and Harvard University was assembled and dispatched to collect seed samples, but it wasn't until 1947 that the team managed to travel inland to examine the original discovery site. When they returned to the United States the researchers discovered that their newly collected seeds proved to be extremely viable and quick to germinate and it wasn't long before seedlings and small saplings were being distributed to botanical gardens and nurseries where they were nurtured and later sold as ornamental and landscape curiosities.
Today, dawn redwoods are a common sight in parks and gardens in North America and Europe and a few brave souls have even installed these living fossils in their back gardens. However, I wouldn't rush out to the garden centre just yet. These fast-growing trees need brontosaurus-sized accommodations since fully mature specimens have been recorded as having a height of 40 m and branches spanning an area of 10 m.
In addition to the group in Kew Gardens, there are some excellent examples of dawn redwoods in Toronto. High Park has a gnarled and weather-beaten metasequoia on the shore of Grenadier pond (just behind the carpet bed display) accompanied by a group almost hidden in a forested area nearby. However, one of the oldest and most spectacular Toronto specimens resides in Edwards Gardens.
When it was planted in 1960, legend has it that the gardener of the day positioned the sapling in such a way that between 7:20 to 7:45 am on June 20 (his wife's birthday), the entire tree is illuminated by the rising sun. Sadly, a careless film crew recently removed some of its large lower branches while they were shooting nearby - a wounding that can sometimes prove fatal for the older and more closely related offspring of the original Sichuan genetic pool. Nevertheless, the main form is still intact and it stands majestically at the top of the hill on the path leading to the west side of the park opposite the children's garden. Even though 50 years of nearby tree and shrub growth have slightly diminished the morning illumination effect, this particular living fossil continues to stand as a testament to one gardener's devotion and creativity.

"The building works were fraught with difficulties from the start. Atack, the builder, did not have enough capital to work continuously, and had trouble finding enough men to work on the site. This was partly because at a time of high employment, reliable and skilled workers were hard to find.
The work progressed only slowly, sometimes held up by bad weather, and sometimes for more unpredictable reasons. In 1855 Britain was at war in the Crimea. On 17th September there was a half-day holiday to celebrate the fall of Sebastopol, and the following day few men turned up for work.
Brodrick was sometimes not satisfied as to the quality of the work, or the building materials. There were delays in the supply of building stone from Rawdon Hill Quarries, and sometimes poor quality stone was sent. On one occasion Brodrick took a hammer and destroyed a faulty cornice stone to prevent it being used. Stone had to be obtained from other quarries at Sturdy, Pool Bank, Bramley Fall and Calverley Wood, and from Darley Dale in Derbyshire. In all, stone (millstone grit) from 17 different quarries was used. Stone for the carvings came from Rawdon Hill.
In April 1856 matters came to a head. Work was stopped; Atack had run out of money, and Brodrick refused to pay him any more, as the builder had already been overpaid. The committee overseeing the work reached an agreement with Atack, and work was re-started. But by the autumn, Atack and Brodrick were again arguing over payment and in December, Atack had overspent his contract by over £2,000, and the work was still unfinished. In January 1857 work stopped completely, and in March Atack went bankrupt. He claimed £20,000 from the council for arrears and extra work not included in the contract, but was paid only £3,000. Other contractors were brought in to finish the work, and Donaldson, the clerk of works left to work in India.
As the building progressed, expensive alterations and additions were made to the original plans. The idea of a truly grand building to reflect the civic pride of Leeds had taken hold, and no expense was spared. When Brodrick was told to choose locks for the doors, he was told to 'give preference to those with the most brass about them'. An exception was made in the matter of making the building fire-proof; it was considered to be too costly!
By September 1858, when Queen Victoria was due to perform the opening ceremony, the building was still not finished, and there was much work to do. The tower was incomplete. The interior decoration, apart from in the Victoria Hall had still to be carried out and there were carpets and furnishings to fit. On 30th September 1858 the council voted the sum of £20,000 for finishing and furnishing the building. This was in addition to the £800 already spent on furnishing the mayor's rooms.
There was great controversy over whether a tower should be added to the hall. Barry had suggested that a tower should be added, and Brodrick had produced a design which would cost £6,000 to build. This was turned down by the council, but in September 1853 Alderman Hepper tried again to persuade the council to grant £7,000 for a tower. He was outvoted by 27 to 20.
Opponents of the tower, such as Joss Bower from Hunslet, thought that it would cost too much money and be of no practical use. Alderman Hepper and Dr. Heaton and their supporters were in favour of adding the tower to give both dignity and beauty to the Hall. It would be a pity, said Heaton, having spent so much already on the building, not to spend a few extra thousands to complete it.
A compromise was reached in February 1854, when the council granted the money to construct the roof so that it would support a tower if eventually one was built. The matter was finally settled in March 1856 when the construction of the tower was approved by a majority of 19. The contract for building the tower was awarded to Addy and Nicolls of Leeds. The grand staircase, which had been part of the original design, had to be omitted when the plan was changed to include the tower.
The tower was to have a clock and a bell, the cost of these not to exceed £800. A clock was important, as most people did not have a watch, and there was no radio to tell them the time. The clock has 4 faces, and was designed by Edward Beckett Denison, and made by Dent of London. The bell that goes with it weighs 4 tons, and was made by Warner's of Cripplegate, London. Its dimensions are: Diameter 6ft 2ins, height 5ft, thickness of sound bow 6 inches, and weight of the clapper (which is of wrought iron) 1cwt. The cost of the bell was £662.12s

"Man indicted for alleged racial attack in post-Katrina New Orleans
A former New Orleans resident was charged last week with federal hate
crimes for his alleged role in a racially motivated shooting of three
black men in the days after Hurricane Katrina.
The man, Roland J. Bourgeois Jr., 47, is accused of plotting to defend
his Algiers Point neighborhood ""from outsiders"" including
African-Americans, constructing barricades on public streets and using
racial epithets to describe black people, according to the five-count
At one point, the charges claim, Bourgeois said, ""Anything coming up this street darker than a paper bag is getting shot.""
The indictment charges Bourgeois with doing just that when three black
males walked through the neighborhood toward a makeshift Coast Guard
evacuation center on Sept. 1, 2005. Bourgeois fired a shotgun at the
trio, felling Donnell Herrington and wounding Herrington's two
companions near the corner of Pelican Avenue and Vallette Street,
according to the indictment.
Later, Bourgeois plucked Herrington's bloodied baseball cap from the
ground and proudly displayed it to others, boasting that he ""got one""
and had shot a ""looter,"" according to a witness.
Bourgeois, who denied any knowledge of the incident to federal agents,
is also accused of coercing an eyewitness to the shooting to lie to
Bourgeois left Algiers Point after the hurricane and now lives in
Columbia, Miss., according to the U.S. Department of Justice's Civil
Rights Division, which is prosecuting the case along with U.S. Attorney
Jim Letten's office.
filed last Thursday, charges Bourgeois with conspiracy to commit a hate
crime, committing a hate crime with a deadly weapon and with intent to
kill, making false statements and obstruction of justice. He faces a
possible sentence of life in prison if convicted.
The Herrington shooting was the subject of a lengthy Justice Department
investigation into claims that white residents of Algiers Point
attacked African-Americans in a spate of racially motivated violence in
the wake of Katrina. Algiers Point did not flood, though it did sustain
wind and storm damage.
The hurricane prompted more than a dozen residents in the neighborhood,
most of whom are white, to take up arms, barricade streets with downed
trees and debris, and coordinate vigilante patrols of the area.
Bourgeois' mother, Pam Pitre, acknowledged in April that her son fired
his shotgun at a black man that day and kept the man's hat. Pitre
insisted her son ""is not a racist"" and said another man also fired. She
said the shooting had nothing to do with skin color.
One witness, Terri Benjamin, recalled hearing gunfire and seeing
Bourgeois among a group of armed white men. Bourgeois was gripping a
shotgun and celebrating.
""My neighbor was jumping up and down, hooting and hollering like he was
big-game hunting and he got the big one,"" she said earlier this year.
""All of his friends were rallying him on, and they were cheering.""
Another armed man approached soon afterward and told the group that the wounded man was still alive a few blocks away.
According to Benjamin, Bourgeois said, ""I'm gonna kill that nigger,""
and ran, barefoot and shirtless, down the street before turning and
jogging out of view.
Benjamin then heard another gunshot. And Bourgeois ran back to the group with a bloody baseball cap.
""And he brandished the cap for all of his friends,"" Benjamin recalled. ""Everybody cheered. They were happy for him.""
Herrington called news of the indictment on Thursday a ""huge relief.""
""It feels good to know that steps are being taken toward bringing that
guy -- or those guys -- toward justice. It's been a long time coming,""
Herrington and his companions have said they were trying to get to an
evacuation center set up at the ferry terminal in Algiers Point.
Herrington, who lives in Algiers, said his group was walking when a
white man pointed his shotgun and, without saying a word, fired.
Shotgun pellets peppered his throat, torso and arms. He recalls
scrambling to his feet and running. Herrington also remembers two more
armed men joining the first gunman. As he ran, a second shotgun blast
tore through his back.
Herrington eventually found his way to the home of an African-American
couple who drove him to West Jefferson Medical Center, where he
underwent emergency surgery to repair his internal jugular, which was
shredded by buckshot.
His companions, cousin Marcel Alexander and friend Chris Collins,
suffered minor gunshot wounds. Alexander said he and Collins were
briefly taken hostage by a group of about five armed white men, one of
whom threatened to set them on fire. Eventually the group allowed
Alexander and Collins to flee.
Bourgeois is the only person charged to date in the shooting incident.
Herrington said no police officers interviewed him while he was at the
hospital, though officers were present during his stay. He was later
shuttled to a Baton Rouge medical facility.
When Herrington returned to New Orleans he said he visited the 4th
District police station, but officers there didn't file a report on the
After the police failed to investigate, Herrington said he felt ""nobody cared.""
Federal investigators canvassed the neighborhood at various points last
year. Several residents acknowledged testifying earlier this year
before a federal grand jury.
Bourgeois was living months ago with his mother in Mississippi. She
defended him in an interview in April, saying her son was terrified by
the lawlessness in the city following the storm.
She said he had been threatened by a group of African-Americans and
""pelted with bottles"" in the days before the shooting occurred. Pitre,
who heard a narrative of the events from her son, said he had
encountered three dangerous and ""arrogant"" African-American men that
The men, who were trying to break into parked cars, ""looked like gang members"" to her son, she said.
After the trio of black men tried to move one of the barricades
blocking the street, Bourgeois and another man began shooting at them,
Pitre said. ""Both men had guns. Both fired,"" she said, adding that she
didn't know the name of the other shooter.
Pitre said the shots were meant to ""scare,"" not to kill.
The only reason the matter came to the attention of federal
authorities, she noted, is that ""this man Roland shot survived and is
telling his tale.""
Herrington has long maintained that he and his companions had nothing
to do with any criminal activity and were simply trying to make their
way out of the stricken city.
A court date for Bourgeois had not been set as of last Thursday evening,
according to court records. The investigation is ongoing, according to a
new release issued by the Justice Department.",en,web

Solutions to help the world live and work more sustainably
We developed the Renewable Energy Cheaper than Coal (RE<C) initiative to drive down the cost of renewable energy. We’ve published our results to help others in the field continue to advance the state of concentrating solar technologies.
Google Earth Engine
Google Earth Engine, now part of Google Geo, makes decades of satellite imagery archives, data and tools available to scientists and governments around the world so they can monitor and measure changes in the Earth’s environment.
RechargeIT was launched to demonstrate plug-in electric vehicle (EV) technology and accelerate its adoption. With several new EVs now available in the marketplace, we have transitioned our employee car sharing fleet to include 30 of the newest plug-in vehicles, with over 200 EV chargers currently in place.
We developed Google PowerMeter as a free energy monitoring tool to raise awareness about the importance of giving people access to their energy information.
Investments and grants
Google.org has invested $45 million in a range of renewable energy research and emerging technologies including solar, wind, and geothermal to help determine which ones can scale to meet the world’s energy needs. Several of our early investments have proven so successful that renewable energy investing is now managed within our corporate investment portfolio, which continues to seek out technologies with breakthrough potential.
Informing health policies and providing early warning systems for disease outbreaks
Health Speaks, a pilot project to make quality health information available in local languages, used crowd-sourcing to translate English Wikipedia health articles into Arabic, Hindi and Swahili.
Special search results for critical health queries
When Google users search for acute health-related keywords, they’re presented with vital information—such as poison control numbers or suicide prevention hotlines—at the top of search results.
Flu Vaccine Finder
Flu Vaccine Finder was developed to provide users tips from the U.S. Health and Human Services. Users who search for “flu” could find suggestions on how to stay healthy and a flu shot locator that uses Google Maps to show nearby locations offering a seasonal and/or H1N1 flu vaccine.
Investments and grants
Dr. Wolfe and the Global Viral Forecasting Initiative Google.org funded the work of Dr. Nathan Wolfe and his team at the Global Viral Forecasting Initiative (GVFI), to develop a system to prevent pandemics, and to collect and report the origins and characteristics of the Ebola virus in the Congo Basin.
MassTag diagnostics in Bangladesh and Sierra Leone
Our $2.5 million in funding to Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public health helped establish two vanguard labs in Bangladesh and Sierra Leone focused on discovering and monitoring new pathogens using MassTag PCR, a type of diagnostic tool.
A regional disease surveillance network in Southern Africa
We've provided $2 million to establish the Southern African Center for Infectious Disease Surveillance (SACIDS), a regional network that detects diseases and coordinates response efforts.
Helping developing countries use information to shape policies, improve education and protect the environment
MapMaker for Development
Google MapMaker allows anyone to customize and update Google Maps and Google Earth. It can be useful for organizations in developing countries to map water sources, new schools, health care providers, banking services, or new businesses. Our MapMaker for Development initiative created MapMakerpedia, a community-generated learning portal that helps organizations maximize their use of MapMaker.
Open Data Kit and the Surui Tribe
Open Data Kit (ODK), which began as a Google.org sponsored project, helps organizations collect and manage data via mobile devices. Our Google Earth and Earth Engine teams collaborated with ODK and the Surui tribe in the Amazon to upload critical data on the health of the Amazon forest via Android mobile devices in order to document its carbon value and combat deforestation.

"Weather: Sunny morning, cloudy afternoon
The team arrived at Michigan International Speedway at 7:00 am to start the most important day of the competition.
Today, 550 competition points will be decided: the endurance (300 points), fuel economy (100 points) and the design event scoring (150 points). Here's the situation as it was in the morning. We are 8th overall, 98 points down from 1st place. The team in 10th position is only 17 points behind us. To finish in the top 10 and ensure our trip to the German competition, we need to reinforce our position. Our 15th place in autocross meant we were 36th in line of the afternoon running group for the endurance event.
All morning long, the team finalized the car's preparation for the endurance event. If the F2012 completes the endurance run, it will be the first sub-300 pound car in Formula SAE history to complete the endurance event! At noon, the top 3 design finalists were announced: Universität Stuttgart, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology and Oregon State University. We finished 4th in the finals, a result that disappointed a few team members. Nevertheless, the 125 points we got helped us increase the gap between us and 10th place.
At 2:30 pm, the team went to the fuel station to get the car filled up before the endurance. At 4:00 pm, the ETS racecar launched from the starting line! From the 3rd lap, the car's potential truly showed for all to see: the F2012 was lapping 3 seconds faster than its autocross time and 2 seconds faster than everyone on the track! By lap 10, the car went in the pits for the mandatory driver change. In merely 2 minutes, the car was back on the track. After 10 other laps the car received the checkered flag. That's how ETS made FSAE history by being the lightest car to ever finish the endurance!
The team then brought the car to the fuel station to get its fuel consumption measured: 2.6 liters, which is good for 9th place. At 8:00 pm, the team attended the awards ceremony. The team was awarded the FEV Powertrain Award for innovation in powertrain design. The team also received a trophy for finishing 8th overall!
After a big party evening, the team is now on its way back to Montreal. There is a lot of work to do in preparation for Formula North (May 26-29) and to improve the F2012's speed. We will also be taking part in the first round of the CADL autocross championship at Sanair on May 19-20.",en,books
"As I begin this post, I am nine days, six hours and 31 minutes away from leaving a very comfortable, generously-paid job where my colleagues and leadership respect me and treat me well. In just over a week’s time, my girlfriend (and adventuring partner), Aubrey, and I will be driving off into the night, embarking on an incredible roadtrip to seek out a new home somewhere beyond the Rocky Mountains.
There are no words to convey my excitement.
For as long as I’ve existed, there has always been an obligation to someone else’s rules lurking just beyond the horizon. Even on vacations, where time is theoretically mine, there was the lingering, ever-present knowledge that before I knew it, I would go back to a world of obliging someone else’s whims. For the first time, I’ll escape those bonds. It’s a feeling of freedom I’ve never known.
It must be stressed that while Full Sail has been a great place to work and I’m grateful for the experience, I had a job there and I have a handful of problems with working any “job,” no matter who supplies it. When I say job in this context, I mean any paid activity wherein you provide 40+ weekly hours in exchange for a regular paycheck, benefits and perhaps a reasonable approximation of social interaction. I’m a difficult, demanding, even impossible person, so these problems loom larger for me than perhaps they do you.
When you arrive at your job and get down to the business of working, you are addressing problems that are not yours. These are the problems of whatever organization has hired you for your job. Depending on your level of career advancement and achievement, the problems you solve may range from the tedious (data entry) to the complicated (project or team management). No matter the complexity of your daily tasks, though, you can be assured that none of the problems they address are actually your own. While it is true that, through initiative, hard work and persistence, your handling of the organization’s problems can enrich your knowledge, experience and career prospects, this doesn’t change the fact that you’re doing someone else’s work.
Unless you’re working at some sort of hippy, ultra-progressive company, you give 96% of your weeks to your job. That is a shitload of time. When I write it out like that, the egregious criminality of giving away that much of your life to someone who isn’t you seems so obvious, I can’t even come up with anything else to say.
I’ve spent a lifetime resenting any condition where someone else had authority to direct the discharge of my energies. The trade you make while collecting a paycheck is that in exchange for the money, someone gets to tell you what to do with 96% of your weeks. Even with the best boss, this deal is crap: Who wants to spend this much of their lives following orders?
In the typical job arrangement, I would show up each day and give a significant amount of time, energy, imagination and passion to the tasks of the organization. If I worked exceptionally hard while not being a douche and doing my best to help others be successful, I could earn promotions and more money. I would not become wealthy. Meanwhile, assuming successful management of the company, those who own the organization would increase their wealth. For many people, maintaining the wealth of others in exchange for a job’s security is a fine trade. That doesn’t work for me. If there’s anyone who should be wealthy off the sweat of my brow, I’m the first person on that list.
This is also including the assumption that whomever it is who owns the company is making the right decisions, which is absolutely not a given. There’s an illusion of security in a paycheck that comes crashing down as soon as layoffs or bankruptcy are announced (hello, domestic auto manufacturers). I’d rather have control of my fate than leave it in the hands of someone else.
Alignment of Interests
If your company did not need you, you would not exist there. This is a simple, business-driven reality and under no circumstances would I ever begrudge any organization this simple fact. Business is not and should not be charity. Still, think about it. The interest of the business is always and will always be the business. Never you, as an individual. This is an important fact to remember as you commit 96% of your weeks to the job that has hired you. You are the only person you can trust to have your own best interests as a top priority. Rest assured, if the business felt as though it could get more of your time while paying you less, it would surely take that arrangement. It’s just business.
You show up early, stay late. You take on extra projects and complete them in your spare time. You’re good to your coworkers and can always be relied upon in a pinch. Congratulations, you’re on your way to promotions and potential raises.
The trouble is, if you gave this level of effort for clients instead of your boss, you’d make a whole lot more money.
If you’re following the thread of my argument, you might be thinking “hey, wow, having a job is slavery and my company is screwing me over!”
Two things to note: Having a job gives you incredible opportunities to learn, grow and network while giving you the stability to develop yourself over the long term.
Secondly, unless you signed some sort of contract, you can leave any time you like. If you’re prepared.
So prepare yourself. Maybe I’m young and idealistic, but I firmly believe that the pursuit of things I genuinely love will bring me infinitely more reward than being paid to worry about someone else’s problems. I believe that dedicating the bulk of my time to my own growth, wealth and self-selected challenges, rather than to the development of someone else’s business, is the only conscionable use of my time. I believe that investing myself in an organization whose best interest is something that isn’t me would be to ignore one simple fact: I’m going to die one day. I need to make the most of my life and working for someone else isn’t going to cut it.
You may be following this, finding none of my assessments about having a job objectionable and thinking to yourself that I am, in fact, absurdly difficult and demanding. If that is so I salute you: your expectations for your life are much more easily satisfied.
I’m stuck wanting something else for myself. Thankfully, I’ve got some role models to help me handle this drive for a self-directed life.
I heard Adam Savage give a talk where he mentioned that his line of work is mostly freelance. This perked up my ears. If you’ve spent any amount of time watching MythBusters, you know that Adam has a singular passion for the creative work that he does. He currently has the best job in the world because he desperately, obsessively craves the joy of making things. He’s incredibly good at it. I’m certain he never could have attained his world-class skills without first loving the work to begin with.
Nick Popovich, Super Repo Man
If you need a defaulted plane retrieved from a deadbeat, you call this guy. Nick had some flight skills and did his first repo on a whim. Now he owns a $20 million business grabbing planes from all corners of the globe. He’s good at it and he enjoys the work. Imagine the waste of his talents if he had stuck to being a traditional pilot and never realized his unique ability to resolve impossible, dangerous situations.
John is obsessive about details in design, typography, user experience and software development. He’s also obsessive about Apple. It shocks me that time and again, John is able to render completely accurate predictions about Apple’s direction and upcoming products. It’s a level of insight no one else on the web can match. It also puts professional investment analysts to shame. Is it incredible that six-figure salaried analysts can’t match the insight and prescience of a guy working from his home on a blog he maintains by himself? A little bit, but it should not be surprising at all. Only a love and passion for his subject matter could have made John the authority on all things Apple on the web.
I don’t know that she feels great about me saying so here, but it’s important to the legend: my mom didn’t finish high school or go to college. She does have a GED. She’s a minority for whom english is a second language. In pretty much all the ways a single mom can have the chips stacked against her, she had.
My mom loves animals – always has. It’s truly an obsession with her. In my childhood, I can recall the ownership of three ostriches, a donkey, six geese, dozens of chickens, an African Grey Parrot, dozens of dogs, some cats and multiple generations of coral reef tanks with tropical fish that made the house a viable field trip destination.
When I was very young, my mom took a certificate program at the New York School of Dog Grooming. To pay homage to James Herriot, no capped and gowned don ever looked back to his years among the spires of Oxford with more nostalgia than did my mother to her two months at NYSDG.
If I am difficult and demanding, then my mom truly is impossible. Nonetheless, she endured years of working for shitty bosses at shittier dog grooming shops. I don’t know how she did it, but one day, she had enough. I’m not sure where she got the funds, but she put together enough money to lease and renovate a commercial space, adding all of the kennels, baths, and other equipment necessary to provide absurdly clean, professional dog grooming services. For pretty much the rest of my childhood (and to this day), she was self-employed, her own boss. Despite the statistics for small business failure, my mom was and continues to be wildly successful at her trade without any training in business, marketing or finance. She doesn’t need it: she’s just incredibly good at what she does, wanted to provide the best possible service and has always loved her work. Not many other people can offer this. This was enough to ensure I never went hungry as a kid.
The message is clear: if you love the work you do, you can become so good at it that whatever rewards you seek become attainable.
I’ll say it again: I’m going to die one day. I don’t know if it’s next year or many decades from now or somewhere in between. What I do know is that expending my energies within the narrow, limiting, self-denying confines required by the traditional job is a complete waste of whatever existence I have at my disposal.
Aubrey has brought many incredible gifts of insight to my life, but chief of among them is this: you shouldn’t spend any significant amount of time doing something you don’t want to do. I owe so much of my evolution to that crucial realization.
I’m excited to be in business for myself. The nagging feeling that plagued me for so long, the feeling that I was somehow missing the point of life and wasting my time, is completely gone.
I’ve discovered a list of things that I absolutely love to do. I’m already good at some of them while others will require years of time to develop. That’s no problem – the love makes it easier to get through the rough spots. I’ve spent years aggressively growing myself to reach this point. I had no idea where I was heading.
Now I know. I can’t wait to be able to focus on what’s truly important, free from the distraction of minding someone else’s business.

"Hi Guys! Well, high winds, power outages, the helicopters circling my house all morning – it’s all going crazy in Atlanta this week! I’m happy to be back online and able to tell you a few bits of news around the blogs this week as I catch up.Â Media breaks can be good I suppose, but yours truly usually needs to be forced by a natural disaster or something.
First, I stumbled onto The Complete Organizing Solutions Blog via Tanna, who emailed me to ask if she could use a picture of my pursery. Hey, to anyone who would like to post any of my mediocre-at-best photography from flickr, you can always be my guest! Thanks Tanna. This is a great blog for organization inspiration. Check it out!
Next, I was thrilled to see another favorite blogger, Victoria, a.k.a sfgirlbybay, featured in the March issue of Sunset magazine. It’s funny, Victoria switches up her apartment styling so often that I almost didn’t recognize it from the first picture. It seemed oddly familiar but it wasn’t until I saw her tulip chairs that I knew where I knew that place from! The most heroic thing about Victoria’s styling,Â is that she is CONSTANTLY switching up and rotating her art collection. This is no easy feat. It usually takes me about five years to get one arrangement just right. Victoria has mad skillz when it comes to arranging art. Perhaps she needs to go into business on the side helping the rest of us compositionally challenged types! Congratulations Victoria!
Next, I caught up on the old DVR. Of course Lost, The Wire, and In Treatment came first. I think the most entertaining thing I saw from last week was Michael Kors LOSING IT on Project Runway during the WWE Divas Challenge. It was like getting the giggles in church, he just could not get it under control. To check it out, be sure to catch the Reunion episode before watching the Bryant Park episode this week.
Finally, as a blogger, I just had to check out Quarterlife. Like all other shows by this duo (Herskovitz and Zwick), they take a typical formula, throw in a tortured misunderstood artist, stripped a few characters of makeup and maybe stick them in glasses and create what they think is a really deep show. Like thirtysomething and Once and Again before it, Quarterlife seems like it’s about four times longer than it is. I mean with TiVo, it’s about 40 minutes, but it feels like 4 hours because it’s so boring.

"While you can’t predict the future, Wanda Chambers, senior vice president of payment services at Suncoast Schools Federal Credit Union, believes in being prepared for it.
“Live one day at a time, but you have to keep your eye on the future,” said Chambers, who has been with the $5.1 billion Tampa, Fla.-based credit union since 1995.
The latest Women to Watch recipient admits she only began to understand the differences and benefits of credit union membership when she joined the Suncoast Schools team. Like many, once she saw the good credit unions do she got hooked on the industry and has been a vocal advocate ever since.
“It’s funny, I didn’t know at the time I was hired that I would find a career here,” said Chambers, who found the credit union through an ad in the newspaper. “I think Suncoast Schools helped me actualize what dreams were in place and helped me develop as a professional and a leader. It’s amazing how being part of an organization that really cared about me, and truly all its employees, makes a difference. I found credit unions, and I am exactly where I belong, doing what I enjoy most every day.”
She added that while others may be daunted by challenges, she’s always looked forward to meeting them head on.
“I’m a problem solver,” said Chambers. “I really enjoy tackling tougher tasks and using analytical thinking skills to find creative solutions to help our members and the credit union as well. The best part of my job has been working with the team we have here at Suncoast and getting to know the members so we can help them and best serve their needs.”
To Chambers, innovation has its roots in necessity.
“When you think about it, innovation is born from necessity and the application of critical and creative thinking to improve upon the current needs and determining the needs of the future,” she said.
It starts with communication, which she believes to be the key to building trust and an environment where ideas can be shared honestly and openly.
“My staff says I stay calm in the face of adversity, and while I don’t always feel that way on the inside, I’m happy to be perceived that way,” joked Chambers. “To innovate and have real change, I think it goes back to trust. I’m not content being average nor with Suncoast being average. I want to do well and for the people around me to do well too. I think it goes back to trust. If you build that trust and rapport with the staff, know what they’re capable of, then challenging the status quo is about trying to constantly improve– whether our services, process or the team. So we set the bar high but are realistic in what can be achieved and we’re lucky we have such a great group of people who work here.”
She added that sense of ownership has helped Suncoast do more for its members. Among the many initiatives Chambers is proud of, automating the process for front line staff using workflow document management solutions stands out.
In 2000, Chambers spearheaded the drive to find a solution that would allow Suncoast to eliminate waiting time for members when they visited a branch that didn¹t have their member folder on site. When this happened, tellers needed to request information from the branch where the folder was stored.
To decrease the credit union’s dependency on paper and give employees instantaneous access to information, an enterprise content management solution was implemented.
All member documents and information are stored electronically in a central location and are securely accessible to staff with a simple mouse-click in their everyday and core banking applications. Instead of relying on paper, Suncoast scans some 300,000 documents into its system every month, saving on costs for storing and shipping paper, while making preparation for audits a simple task. In addition, Suncoast processes more than 100,000 checks every day, which are then automatically imported and indexed. Decreasing Suncoast¹s reliance on paper, has not only increased speed, accuracy and member service, but also decreased costs and helped make it easier for the credit union to proactively comply with ever changing regulations.
According to Chambers, integrating the technologies Suncoast relies on every day like its core banking platform, loan origination system and accounting software with its ECM solution has helped employees become more productive. In addition, she led efforts to use electronic document workflow to automatically forward electronic documents and the pertinent information that surrounds them straight through processes, without manual intervention.
“It’s helped employees focus on helping our members and providing a better experience, where members obtain the services they need and want faster,” said Chambers. “I’m also proud that Suncoast was the first financial institution nationally to image enable our ATMs. Since 2007 our members have been making deposits of checks and cash at our ATMs beating out even the big banks.”
A calculated risk taker, she believes that competition is a good thing.
“Whether it’s from nonconventional arenas or the traditional big banks, competition helps clarify the benefits of credit union membership and the difference we deliver loud and clear,” said Chambers. “There is still this perception that credit unions aren’t as sophisticated in terms of technology and products and services and that simply isn’t true. We have to continually educate and beat the drum of literacy and why our people focused business model makes good sense financially for consumers, to change that perception.”
She added that future leaders can’t take a one size fits all approach to leadership.
“Keep an open mind to emerging technology, listen to your staff and members, learn to effectively communicate and take the initiative, “ said Chambers. “Never stop learning in your personal and professional life. Mentors come in all shapes, sizes and walks of life, some may even be younger than you, so be open to what others can teach you.”",en,reference

With the long running WWE SmackDown! series about to make the transition to next-gen - SmackDown! vs Raw 2007 will be released on PS3 and Xbox 360 later this year, alongside PS2 and PSP versions - we were recently given a rare opportunity to quiz the masterminds behind the game, the Yokohama-based development team Yuke's.
In part one of our exclusive interview, we quiz them on next-gen difficulties, how they sidestep not being able to motion-capture top WWE stars, and what their favourite SmackDown! games have been so far...
How difficult a transition is it moving from current generation systems to the new consoles?
Hiromi Furuta (senior vice president and SmackDown! producer, Yuke's): From PS2 to next generation has not been that difficult a transition. We're not actually finished yet but, so far, it hasn't been so difficult.
Probably the most difficult part of the project this year will be how we filter the game back to PS2 and, especially, PSP. That's one of the goals - to have our main features on all the platforms.
Have you found that's actually limited what you can do on next-gen consoles, because you're always thinking in the back of your mind, ""Well, I've got to get that working on PSP as well""?
HF: We can't really say there are no limits on what we can do for next-gen, but we try not to be too limited in what we do. Basically we think of next-gen first and then think, ""What's the closest we can come to that on each platform going back?""
What's been the hardest thing to implement in current-gen? The fighting within the crowd?
HF: It's not so much feature-specific. The main difficulty is that processing the game uses up tons of memory for the animation. We're always very tight on memory and all these new features, whether it's fighting in the crowd or the interactive grapples, there's just tons of new animation. We're already stuffed to the gills on PS2 and had a lot of trouble last year getting everything in PSP.

This would certainly be the ideal solution. What's a good way to

"Here are women who are tied up, punished, blindfolded, or used for a lover's pleasure. Frequently - when they're lucky - they're also fucked or allowed to pleasure themselves. Daddy's Girl: He's actually her lover Mike, but when she wants to be spanked, he's her daddy. He flips up her short plaid skirt and runs his hands over her cotton panties. She raises her hips to help him yank them down. It feels so good to be over his lap. He starts hitting her ass slowly and sensually. Her cunt is wet because she wants this so much. Wild Child: It's a long flight, and she's sitting close by on the plane. She's maybe 20, about half his age, with a lot of attitude. But she has a smoldering sexuality that makes him want to take control of her. He puts an ice cube in her bra and tells her to rub it against her nipple. Then he orders her to take three more ice cubes to the bathroom and insert them into her pussy. When she comes back to her seat, she has a look of heaven and torture on her face. Now he orders her to remove the ice cubes right there, and to put them into his mouth so that he can taste her juices. 22 stories. 234 pp.",en,books
"Iodine-131 is a dangerous radioactive isotope. It can clog up your thyroid gland and contaminate food. It's been a big problem in Japan (for obvious reasons), but now it's been scarily detected throughout Europe. And nobody knows the source.
Germany, Hungary, Slovakia, Austria, Sweden, and the Czech Republic have all detected clouds of iodine-131 within their borders—that's a very large swath of Europe. Nobody is sure of where it's coming from, Reuters reports, though speculation includes pharmaceutical companies, nuclear submarines, and the transportation of radioactive materials—but scientists are sure it's not from Fukushima. So how would that explain contamination that spans hundreds and hundreds of miles?
The International Atomic Energy Agency says ""the current trace levels of iodine-131 that have been measured do not pose a public health risk,"" but we've heard that so many times before. It's not a cause for panic, but an unexplained cloud of dangerous radioactivity is absolutely cause for concern. It certainly deserves more than 129 words on the IAEA's website. [Reuters]

"Some of our customers may have noticed a new fresh goat milk cheese in our cases. Carolyn Hillman, our go-to fresh chèvre producer for many years, is taking a hiatus from production for the next year or so. While heartbroken about this absence, I am thrilled to be able to support another grande dame of Massachusetts cheesemaking – Susan Sellew of Rawson Brook Farm. Susan is entering her 30th year of production!
In October, fellow cheesemongers, Ross, Tripp and I spent an afternoon with Susan at her farm in Monterey, MA. Tucked in the Berkshire hills, it was a rainy afternoon and the goats didn’t want to leave the shelter of the barn. Inquisitive and friendly – we fell in love with them immediately.
The goats are milked on something that looks a bit like a merry-go-round. Old army helmets serve as feed bowls while they wait their turn. Susan milks the goats three at a time, causing them less stress and keeping the quality of the milk extremely high. The fresh milk is quickly moved to the vat, and transformed into curd. The curds are hung in cheesecloth to drain out the whey. Susan’s fresh goat cheese is exceptional: light, fresh, tangy – a fluffier texture than Carolyn’s, but equally delicious. There is a clean, balanced salt and a mouthwatering finish.
Susan manages her goats on a seasonal basis and doesn’t interfere with their natural breeding cycles. As a result, cheese is made from approximately the first of April through mid-December. After the goats are bred in October, milk and, subsequently, cheese production starts a steady decline. This is followed by a short dry spell until the goats give birth, and fresh milk is once again readily available. Rawson Brook Farm is very small, and Susan’s cheese is not commonly found outside of the Berkshires. We feel lucky that she has decided to share a portion of her production with us.
The Berkshire Food Journal made a short video about Susan several years ago that captures her spirit and philosophy about goat cheese exceptionally well.

"Hello ladies!!!! This will more than likely be my last post on here!!! I just wanted to share wit...
So my fiance has been working his butt off and has not had much time to contribute to the wedding planning and research. So tonight he asked how I was doing with the planning and I showed what I had in mind. So we went back to the colors and initially we wanted chocolate brown and pink but now we have decided we are not in love and want something else. So I suggested black and white damask with yellow. Yellow is one of my fav. colors its bright and it cheers me up. His choice was brown and red. Brown is his color he loves brown he always has his clothes with a brown shade. So we couldnt come to a resolution so we compromised and we added the yellow and brown together we will add some white possibly. I think this works for us and brings both of our likes together. So thats changed and done and we are happy.
Next we spoke in regards to date change whether we wanted to go with Friday or Saturday evening. So either valentines day on that Friday in 2014 or our original date Saturday Feb. 15th 2014. So we have decided to go with...............Saturday after careful consideration we just think that Saturday will work for us and for our family and friends. So that's done :)
Now we are trying to settle on Venue location as we are good to go with his family church for our ceremony. We are choosing between these locations:
The grand atrium - (2 level banquet hall right around the corner from the church)
Maggiano's - (Great food and maybe 5min from the church)
Harvest Moon - (Chinesse restaurant around 20min from the church)
So I feel like we are communicating in what we want and will be on the right path in making our wedding just the way we want I love that his apart of the process. Yayyyy",en,web

"With summer just around the corner, many homeowners are contemplating the efficiency of their central air conditioning systems, including how efficiently the ductwork delivers conditioned air to various parts of the house. But there’s another aspect of air distribution that’s just as important to your home comfort levels. It’s vital that your home also have functioning return-air ducts to provide complete circulation of the air in your home.Without properly placed return-air ducts, the air in your home, especially on the upper floors, can become stale and hot. Several problems can crop up with your return-air ducts.
Before you check the return-air ducts themselves, you should make sure the air conditioning system is actually sending air to the rooms you’re concerned about. Otherwise, you will waste time checking the return-air ducts when the problem lies elsewhere. Check the air supply registers to make sure they are not closed and that nothing is blocking them. Also, check the dampers to make sure that they’re not closed.
Since warm air rises in a home, to get the best use out of return-air ducts they must be located correctly. If you have a second floor, they should be on that floor. Placement within the rooms is also important. The return-air ducts should be placed on the wall near the ceiling. Otherwise, you are just returning cool air.
Return-air ducts must have a free flow of air. Make sure that nothing, such as wallpaper, pictures or furniture, is blocking them. In addition, the holes for the return-air ducts have to be large enough to allow the air to flow easily. If a room that seems stale does not have a return-air duct, install a grill to allow air to flow to another room that does have one.
Keeping the air in your Northeast Ohio home cool and fresh will make it more enjoyable for you and your family this summer. If you have any further questions about this topic or any other home-comfort issue, please contact us at Geisel Heating, Air Conditioning & Plumbing. Our trained and courteous staff will be happy to help.
Our goal is to help educate our customers about energy and home comfort issues (specific to HVAC systems). For more information about return-air ducts and other HVAC topics, download our free Home Comfort Resource guide.

MONTGOMERY, AL (WSFA) -
Hyundai Motor Company is recalling more than 13,500 of its new Veloster coupes after a problem was discovered with the sunroof that can cause it to shatter.
The company reports that some of the cars, which feature a panoramic sunroof design, were involved in situations in which the sunroof shattered and rained down glass onto the driver and passengers.
The recall involves the 2012 model year.
At least five people have suffered minor injuries as a result of the broken sunroofs.
Hyundai says the assembly of the sunroof may have been weakened during installation.
Consumers have complained of the same problem in vehicles made by Kia, Hyundai's sister company.",en,web
"This post covers my attempt at modeling both the old and the new economic models discussed in Michael Bauwens article. I also discuss how the repercussion of the new economic model are captured in my drawings – the big one being that open source technology unarguably creates value at higher efficiencies (lower cost), but rarely replaces the share of market value (dollars) when it displaces proprietary competitors.

This article covers my latest efforts in the Free Charge Controller project. I’ve been working with Jameco to create a development kit for a new version (v4.01). The development kit that Jameco will soon have available for order is a huge step up from my original efforts to build a kit. The design is built on top of an Arduino and is based on Tim Nolan’s design. A charge controller schematic of the design is available.
The need for a cool attic cannot be overemphasized. In case high temperatures build up in the attic, the performance of your air conditioning unit will also be affected. At the same time, your energy bills will shoot up. When heat and moisture in the attic is kept to their respective minimums, the energy efficiency of the house improves considerably.
Solar panels grow more efficient with each passing year. Spurred by private and government sponsored research, efficiency records in thin film solar modules fell at least three times in the past year. Competing technologies spark this race to converting sunlight into electricity, which currently hovers at about 17.4% efficiency.",en,web

"The Indian government calls the Northeast of the country its future power house. The Central Electricity Authority has identified more than 150 sites for large hydropower projects in the Brahmaputra Basin alone. More than 80 of those projects are located in Arunachal Pradesh, promising a plus of more than 50,000 MW of energy in the coming years. Several unique features of the state, including the large number of tribal communities, its seismic activity and its rich biodiversity, render dam building in Arunachal Pradesh exceptionally challenging. The plans appear to fail to acknowledge those challenges: the largest dam currently planned in India is the 2,000 MW Lower Subansiri on the Subansiri River in Arunachal Pradesh, India’s seismically most active region. The opposition to dam-building in Arunachal is meanwhile growing.
In Sikkim, the provincial government has recently awarded contracts to private operators for 26 large hydropower projects on the Teesta River, seven of which will affect Dzongu province. In summer 2007, the “Affected Citizens of Teesta” organized what might have been the longest hungerstrike in the history of Sikkim to protest the planned construction of hydropower projects on the ancestral lands of the indigenous Lepcha community in Dzongu, Sikkim, as you can see in the documentary ""Voices from the Hidden Land."" While the Lepcha also reside in other parts of India and Nepal, the majority of Lepcha lives in India’s Dzongu province. They are set to loose the most from the planned projects on the Teesta River. Notwithstanding the unique cultural and social setting the Dzongu region represents, preparatory studies for the Teesta dams have been of extremely poor quality, lacking adequate assessments of the potential cumulative impacts of the series of dams on the river, as well as an accurate understanding of the Lepcha culture. The authorities have also gravely disregarded national participation laws and failed to provide access to key documents in local languages, as well as prevented challenging questions during public hearings.",en,reference
"Stayed two nights. The park is clean and laidout nicely. the park has a lot of bird nest boxes that are all being used. Fun to watched the birds. The staff gave us recommendations for dinner and sighting for the Wildlife refuge and the diamond loop. Also for lunch... the Diamond Hotel south of Diamond loop. Great hotel build in 1896. Overall Burns is a area where you could spend a week or more. We camped here in a Motorhome.
This is a beautiful, clean park. The roads are gravel, but well maintained and easily navigable. The sites are level and wide, and the utilities are easily accessible. They have a robust cable and many sites have satellite access. The owner is on site and is extremely personable. We camped here in a Motorhome.
Out in the vast sage brush and canyons of Eastern Oregon is the tiny town of Burns and the oasis of Burns RV Park. Real shade trees, level gravel sites, good Wi-Fi coverage & cable TV, small & clean laundry room, old timer but cute & clean bathrooms with 2 toilets & 2 showers, rustic & cozy office, full hookups & just $32 with our Good Sam discount. A real ""mom & pop"" type operation (the woman greeter was friendly & helpful) - not a sterile commercial concrete slab. We would stay there again! We camped here in a Travel Trailer.
This is a Good Sam park. We had a nice site with lots of space compared to lots of RV parks. People were friendly and helpful. Gave us our choice of sites. I would stay here again. We camped here in a Travel Trailer.
Great place to stay. Very small town. This park has Huge pull through sites with gravel, and lots of grass in between. The ladies in the office were really fun to deal with. Great Mexican food in town. We would stay here again. We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.
This is literally the only place for miles in either direction. It has excellent Wi-Fi and cable. The staff is friendly and helpful. Our site was quite small, but the owner had given us a choice and I am sure we could have changed had we been so inclined. That said, we did have issues with the power spiking. Would recommend a surge protector. We had several power outages triggered by our surge protector. If in the area, we recommend you try the excellent restaurant Rhojos if they are open. We would stay here again if in the area. We camped here in a Travel Trailer.
Site 10, $33 +8 Burns RV is good park: level, treed, well-kept, and although on highway 20, the noise is not a problem. -2 no real negatives, it just doesn’t rate a 10. We would definitely stay here again. We camped here in a Motorhome.
Great little park in a small town. Good /large pull through sites. Good cable TV. Nice staff. Stayed for only one night but would be a good place to spend a few days to relax. We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.
This is a great park for overnight, or area activities. Sites vary in length. We have a 38' 5th wheel, and it was easy in and out here. Site was a pull-thru - long, wide and level. Quiet and pretty, with trees and grass. Wifi was good. We would stay here again. Price was with Good Sam discount. We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.
Friendly staff. Nice wide sites. Each site has grassy area and a picnic table on concrete pad. Gravel roads and sites are well maintained. There were some trees but still satellite reception was good. We are total length of 68' and had no problem maneuvering in and out. Even though it is right on the highway we didn't hear traffic. If we return to this area we would stay here again. We camped here in a Motorhome.
This is a very nice park with good sized sites and easily accessed pull throughs. It is well maintained and makes for a good overnight or two in the Burns area. The staff was friendly and helpful. I would stay here again when in the area. We camped here in a Motorhome.
This is a very nice little park in an area without any real RV parks. The management was welcoming and helpful. The sites are good sized and there is ample shade. This is a very good stopping place for a couple of nights. We camped here in a Motorhome.
When there is only one RV park in a town in the middle of nowhere, one wouldn't expect much. However, this one is a jewel. Lots of trees, everything works as it should and easy in, easy out of Highway 20. My only complaint is that the sites near 20 are somewhat noisy although it gets better at night. I highly recommend this park. We camped here in a Motorhome.
This campground was a pleasant surprise considering there aren't many options in the area. Friendly staff, mostly level gravel sites, large trees and grass. Bathrooms were clean but need some work. Wi-Fi and cell service good. 30 amp only in the back-in sites with lots of road noise. It was a fine park for an overnight stay, and will use it again when in the area. Would recommend reservations as it was full the night we stayed. We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.
Lovely campground with delightful and committed owners! We camped in Site 11 which was very quiet, despite the park's proximity to Route 20. Bathrooms small but clean. We would definitely stay there again. We camped here in a Motorhome.
Burns RV Park is an older well-maintained park. It has mature trees and lots of green grass. The roads and pads are gravel. The park can accommodate any size rig. The owner is proud of her park. We would stay here again We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.
This is a very well maintained park that sits adjacent to highway 20 in central Oregon. The sites are large and level gravel pull throughs and back ins. We were in a site near the highway, but for one night it was very nice and not too noisy. If I were to be staying longer I would ask to be moved further away from the road. The staff was pleasant and accommodating. I would stay at this park again without hesitation. We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.
Very, very old former KOA campground. Wi-Fi was spotty at best The shower was the size of a phone booth although clean. The men's room was a ""one holer"" and the stall was about the size of a shoe box. Only one rest room for the entire campground. I'll give it a pass next time, needs lots of work. We camped here in a Motorhome.
The staff is friendly. Park is very nice. Lots of shade trees and sites are spaced nicely with lots of lawn. Had a bit of trouble with leveling at our site as not too level. Verizon air card worked great. We would stay here again. Rate included a GS $5.00 coupon. We camped here in a Travel Trailer.
The rate was a Good Sam rate, less the Good Sam $5 coupon. We had a very long, 50 amp pull through site, but because of two large trees on either side, we were not able to get our roof top satellite. If we had not pulled forward as far as we did we might have gotten a signal. For 1 night we did not want to move when good cable TV was available for most channels except Fox. The park was quiet, clean and the rate was good, so we would stay here again. We camped here in a Motorhome.
Very helpful staff on phone and at check-in. Asked for a shade spot and they were very accommodating. Lots of grass for dog to lay around. Easy to negotiate in a motorhome with a tow vehicle. Roads and sites are gravel with grass and tables. Right on the highway but not noisy at night. Depending on your site, your satellite might have problems but the cable is excellent with about 60 channels to keep most people very happy. It's a great stop-over between Bend and Boise. I would definitely stay here again. We camped here in a Motorhome.
Welcome stop between Bend and Boise, lots of large shade trees and grass but close to highway (quiet at night). pretty grounds, good sites, but bathrooms and laundry were pitiful. Rundown and old. Excellent cable tv , strong VZ aircard and cell signals. Use the RV car wash on south end of town to get the bugs off . We camped here in a Motorhome.
Friendly check-in. WiFi and cable TV excellent. Spaces rather close together. Level enough. The area has been flooded, and half of the CG is closed. It was pretty muddy, but that was expected because of the weather. Right on Hwy 20. I heard some road noise, but it wasn't bad. We camped here in a Motorhome.
Good WiFi, but lots of dog waste in park from the owner's dogs being let out to roam free in park. We have stayed here many times and it has not been like this before. The owners need to clean up their own act. We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.
A very nice park. We had a huge, clean site. It is on a secondary highway but there was no traffic noise at night. Close to town for groceries, etc. Would definitely stay here again. We camped here in a Motorhome.
Would have been a more pleasant stay, unfortunately the sheer number of barking dogs make the park unpleasant. Owner/managers stay right on premises, but did nothing about the dog noise. We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.
This park is right on US 20 on the outside of the city of Burns, OR. As advertised, there are some pull through sites for the huge Class A busses, but they are in the full sun. All of the back-in sites offer shady large trees and full hook-ups. There is a laundry room. The park features excellent cable TV and WiFi at each site. We would stay here again for a few days. We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.
This is a nice park. The pull-throughs are long and there's plenty of space between sites. Quiet even though next to the highway. Good internet and lots of cable TV channels. Great place to stop for the night while crossing Oregon. Previous owners didn't welcome pets, but it is now pet friendly. So if you are like us and were turned away on a prior trip because of a pet, give them another try. We camped here in a Motorhome.
We have a 40 foot fifth wheel, a long tow vehicle, and a car, so we always prefer a long pull through site. This park certainly met our need. Within the last couple of years, the owner converted a portion of a very large pet area into 2 pull through sites that are at least 100 feet long and 30 feet wide. Our site was gravel and very level. Road noise was noticeable, but not annoying. And at night, it was very quiet. Wi-Fi was good. The owner and her family were extremely kind and friendly. We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.
Very nice overnight stay RV Park - easy in, easy out, nice pull-throughs for long RVs. Gravel roads and spaces, concrete pad with table, nice green grass around campground, some shade locations, stayed in space 52 which was in back of park and was easy access. Campground was quiet and road noise was minimal especially after about 10 PM. Hookup was easy and well located with good selection of TV channels.Two negatives were the mosquitoes which were plentiful - likely the peak time of the season - and the cotton from the cottonwood trees was like snow falling - also likely the peak time of the year. We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.
This is a beautiful old campground with huge shade trees and lawn at every site. It was so pleasant to sit outside to listen and watch the many birds in residence. We will definitely be stopping by again. We camped here in a Travel Trailer.
Not the prettiest park you'll pull up to, but don't get discouraged! Great stop over park! Very nice helpful folk, and good working sites. Quiet, safe sites and close to stores for those items you forgot about. Easy access on and off the road. Driving thorough eastern Oregon, there are not many places to stop over, and when the weather gets nasty out there, this park is an oasis to hunker down at. We camped here in a Motorhome.
Nice clean park. Owners were very nice. Check-in went quickly. Wi-fi was fast. Great cable with lots of channels. Very quiet even with the main highway in front of the park, Hwy.20. Will stay again . We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.
This park is mostly older but is decent for an over night stay. It is best described as having 3 areas. There are the permanent sites east of the office. There is the original back in sites among the tall trees. And now there are several VERY LONG modern pull through sites that have new power boxes, etc. Yes, the lady was very pleasant when I checked in. I mentioned Wi-Fi was important to me, and she registered with this. She assigned us the most distant site from the office and showers. This happens to be the shortest of the pull through's. I mentioned we were not towing, had a rather skimpy 29ft class A, and could handle a back in site. She was insistent that the site she had selected was the best for Wi-Fi which seems strange as the antenna was closer to the office. The park is reasonable clean, but the showers are somewhat small and narrow. The Wi-Fi did perform well. We stayed here in a motor home for $28.71 after discount. I would stay here again. Note: The 9 hole golf course in nearby Hinds is only 4 or so miles west. They want $12 to walk the 9 holes. You may have to walk as the office opens at Noon. It is rather rough but a good walk. Watch out for the Goose droppings. We camped here in a Motorhome.
We stayed for a week. Very relaxing, and the staff was very nice. Plenty of room to leash walk your dog but would be great if they would at least have a pen so the dogs could run a bit. Other then that, we really liked the park and would stop again when in the area. We camped here in a Motorhome.
Nicest RV park in area. Some very large Pull throughs and the back ins are in the shade. Wi-Fi strong and Cable plentiful. Restrooms smaller but very clean. Friendly staff. Will stay again when in area. We camped here in a Motorhome.
This is a nice park with a very friendly staff. We had a level pull thru site with a table at the site. The utilities and cable worked very well. This is a well kept park with some shade trees. We will stay here again when in the area. We camped here in a Motorhome.
This was a very nice park with a very friendly owner. With all the heat, he was doing a good job of keeping the grass green. The sites were gravel and we didn't have a lot of trouble leveling our 5th wheel. The sites were large enough with tables at each site and most had shade. Wifi and cable worked good. The bathroom and shower were clean. The laundry room had large machines and a low price. We didn't notice any noise as the A/C ran some of the night. There were lots of geese which looked great flying across the pink night skies. There was a good sized book exchange. We would stay again. We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.
Our site was very small with no table, and we had to unhook our tow to get into it. There seemed to be a lot of permanent residents, which we prefer to be with fellow travelers. It was well kept and landscaped nicely. Staff was very friendly and nice; laundry room was small but clean. Very close to the road, so we had road noise. We camped here in a Motorhome.
This is my second visit. I paid $400 for a monthly rate--hence the lower nightly rate. The park is very clean and the staff is cordial and helpful. There are a few spots with good shade. I enjoyed all of the birds in their many bird houses. My Wi-Fi connection was strong. We camped here in a Motorhome.
Friendly owner. On the highway, but not real noisy as the road is flat. Long gravel sites, mine was perfectly level. She is almost done with 4 sites that must be 65 feet long, they will be perfect for 40DP with toads. Green, grassy, large trees away from the rigs. Staggered sites with room in between, nice setup. The stream adds mosquitos in the morning/twilight but that is the price of green vs. brown and dry. Recommended, paid $30.69 with Good Sam discount. Ours was 30A full hookups and cable. We camped here in a Travel Trailer.
A little over priced, even with the Good Sam discount, but a very nice little park. Easily could stay much longer. It is close to Highway 20, but I think the noise will subside as the evening comes. Very friendly hostess as well as her dog Turbo. We will definitely stay here again, if we are back in this very isolated area. We camped here in a Motorhome.
Very friendly owner and quick check-in. We stayed in a very long pull-through in a new section put in to maximize satellite reception, even though they have cable TV. Very clean park, level gravel sites are wide and long to allow for any size or combination of rigs. We would return any time in this area. We are thinking of staying an extra day to enjoy the area. We camped here in a Motorhome.
This is a wonderful place to spend one day or several. There is some noise from the nearby hwy but has very nice spaces with plenty of room to back in the largest of rigs. The showers were clean and laundry was clean. The mgt was very helpful and courteous. We will definitely make plans to stay again when in this part of Oregon. We camped here in a Motorhome.
Has WIFI, easy access, good power, we needed an overnight stop this, and this was perfect. Owners on site 24 hours a day, friendly and helpful, the park is opened from March 1st. thru Mid-November. Our site was parallel to the road, no problem with road noise after dark. Will stay again when traveling this direction. We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.
Old park, not the nicest management. Big rig access is limited, and pull throughs are parking lot style. Park is over priced for quality, and on the main highway with road noise. We camped here in a Motorhome.
Nice park – lots of beautiful shade trees & lawn at sites. Picnic table and potted petunias at each site. Good voltage, high water pressure. Some highway noise, not excessive. Very small laundry facilities & restrooms, but very clean. Gravel sites & roads. Pay WiFi with good signal. We would return for a longer stay next time we’re in Burns. We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.
Nicest park in Burns but it's pretty basic. Close to the road, only 2 showers and toilets, 2 washers & 1 dryer working, tight sites...but the shade trees, good cable tv , and wifi save the place. Wifi signal is strong but was pretty slow during the evening; better late at night. Try to arrive early enough in the afternoon to get a decent site and hope that the regulars don't walk thru it all night, which happened to us. We camped here in a Motorhome.
We found this park adequate for our one night stay. The clerk was friendly and accommodating. She was just helping out that day but got us checked in OK. We had a nice view of the grassy tent area and our spot was shaded by big trees. There is traffic noise but not bad at night. This park fills up by late afternoon so make reservations or get there early. The WiFi works great, am using it right now to do this rating!! It is a little rustic but not a bad place for the price. We camped here in a Motorhome.
Stayed here 1 night. Small tightly packed spaces. They were gravel and level.Was told Wi-Fi was powerful but never could get on with a strong enough signal to get on internet. Neither could other person I talked to.Advised owner but she was unsure of what to do.To be fair she said she just bought park and seemed eager to do a good job of managing park.Would probably stay here again and see if she follows up. We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.
This park was very clean. WiFi, for which I gladly paid, had been installed within the past two weeks. Management was extremely polite and helpful. Restrooms and laundry were exceptionally clean. I would recommend this park to anyone. I loved the shaded sites and the pull through sites, as well as the cable TV. We camped here in a Travel Trailer.
OK park for an overnight. Highway noise but was quiet at night because traffic stopped. Nice owners/managers. Only has 50 amp plugs so an adapter is needed but supplied by park. All gravel roads and sites. Not much else in the area to choose from. Was wet and cold when we were there so a lot of standing water and wet leaves etc. We camped here in a Travel Trailer.
This is a very nice, small park on the outskirts of Burns. It is an older park, but well maintained by friendly, knowledgable owners. It makes a good base for exploring the Malheur Wildlife Refuge, the Diamond Craters area and Steens Mountain. Although it is located on the highway going out of town, the park is quiet and situated along a small tranquil river. Our site was gravelled and required some levelling, but nothing we couldn't accommodate. There is free coffee in the morning at the office which is stocked with a good supply of paperback books, jig-saw puzzles, some RV supplies and tourist information. We camped here in a Motorhome.
Great price-nice hot springs pool. Pleasant managers. The draw for us was hot springs, unhappily for us it was very windy so the pool was only 95 degrees. Still had a nice time using the tv and WiFi in rec room. Also the cooking shack for guest. Nice touch for only $18. We will be back. Would have given a 10/10 but the cost for private rooms were too high and the pool area needs indoor/ outdoor carpet or cement as you get out. Tracked too much dust/ gravel into RV We camped here in a Motorhome.
This is a hot springs and the RV Park is there to accommodate the hot springs. They accept the PA discount for one night which is all we stayed. The Park itself is all gravel which is dusty and there is no sewer hookups for one night stays. It doesn't matter, even there is room available, you cannot buy sewer hookups for one night period. Overall we enjoyed the Park and it's quietness and I would stay here again. You can't stay anywhere for nine dollars - a very good deal. We camped here in a Motorhome.
This park is only 3 miles from Crane, but has a Burns, OR address. There are several small cabins and pull-thru RV sites with full hook ups in gravel parking lot. Friendly staff and owners. Small store. Rate is Passport America and does not include fee to soak in hot springs-fed pond. Many locals appeared this Saturday night to partake of the springs, but when the sun went down they all disappeared. Good birding. I would stay here again. There are few options for an RVer between Bend and Boise. We camped here in a Motorhome.
We spent one night here under Passport America. It is a small park but we did enjoy ourselves. They have a natural fed hot springs pool that guests can utilize free of charge. We found the hot 'pool' very relaxing. The staff was very nice and in the morning when we left, the camp host came by to thank us for staying. We would definitely stay here again. We camped here in a Motorhome.
We stayed one night on our 2 month trip here. The staff was amazingly friendly, giving us a tour of the facilities. The campground is basically a gravel parking area for motor homes and trailers, and a grassy area for tents. They also have 5 cabins for rent. There is a nice common area with books and big tv. A kitchen is available for use as well. The main draw is the hot springs. There is a pond that is about maybe 1/5 acre, fed by hot springs that made the average water temperature on the day we were here 100 degrees. Wade over to a different section and the water would be warmer or cooler, depending on proximity to the water inlet... different and fun! We camped here in a Motorhome.
The only reason we stayed here was to experience a hot spring and indeed it was a wonderful experience. I really don't think the owners take the RV side of this park seriously. The pull through sites are just marked off areas in an incredibly dusty dirty parking area. The showers were just gross. We paid for two nights but left one day early because i was so disappointed with the environment. We would never return. Cannot recommend this park at all. We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.
No, this RV facility is not a 10 but the hot springs pond that is free 24 hours a day, the friendly staff, the clean facility, easy level pull through spaces and the PA rate of $12 makes this place an eleven. I drove an extra 100 miles to send my birthday here. We stay here on our way south and back when ever possible. We camped here in a Motorhome.
A very neat little RV Park. They have a natural hot springs that guests can soak/swim in, very nice place, very nice staff/owners. Easy in and out. If you're ever near Burns OR and need a place to stay for the night, this is it! We camped here in a Motorhome.
Normally I would have rated this park a 6 but the hot springs (free to campers), easy pull throughs, and friendly staff (and the low price: $18, 1st nite $9 for Passport America) made me bump it up. It really is a nice relaxing place to soak in the hot pond. Large pull throughs take any size rig, even triple towers. But it is remote, the nearest restaurant is 25 miles away in Burns. But if you're going across Oregon and need a place to spend a nite or two this place is just fine. We'd stay here again. We camped here in a Motorhome.
This is a primitive US Forest Service campground adjacent to US-395 about 20 miles north of the town of Burns, OR (closest town) located on the west side of the highway. I think it was about 55 miles south of the town of John Day, OR. We ""dry"" camped here for a family reunion. We used the one site in the middle of the campground that would accommodate two large fifth wheel trailers and several tents. Other sites are a mix of back-in and pull-through. Most are relatively small. The roads are narrow and it took some work with walk alongside guides for me to move my 40 footer through the campground around several curves to the site. I pre-walked my route out to make sure I had a good handle on where I had to start my turns to clear the large Ponderosa pine trees. No significant problems other than a few rubs against some low hanging branches that waxed out when I got home. If you need a great deal of room to move your rig through a campground don't even try this one. Once you enter you are committed to a curving route through the entire campground or you have to back out onto US-395 (really bad plan). The campground is right alongside US-395 but we rarely heard much road noise even when outside. Much of that is probably due to this campground's very rural setting and the fact that there just isn't much traffic on US-395. The campground is designated by the US Forest Service as a ""horse"" campground and as such it has a corral and hitching posts. There was no smell or fly problem as those facilities are quite a ways away from the actual camping area. We saw two horse there briefly during our stay. I suspect during the fall hunting season the campground sees more. There were maybe 3-4 other small groups camping here. It doesn't see much use except during the fall. The restroom is brand new and was in great shape. It's a pit toilet with no running water. It stayed in great shape except for the lowlife that pulled in late one night and his young wife threw up all over the floor and drove away. Our group carried water in and washed the floor out. There is a solar power water supply system and it is slowwwwwww!! Figure 20-30 minutes to fill a five gallon container. Make sure your RV fresh water tank is topped off prior to arrival. No sewer hookups or dump facilities. Plan on hauling it out with you. Some of the sites have US Forest Service concrete picnic tables (ours did). Even with it's shortcomings it's a beautiful location and we had a special family reason for wanting to be there. With a little planning and a few extras (we had two 6000kW generators, a Traeger BBQ grill, and many other self managed amenities it was a wonderful trip. I'd recommend it for a getaway from people location any time. We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.
Easy access and generous gravel sites for all sizes of rigs next to a small casino with adequate restaurant. The park has a few trees that are too small for shade and no grass. Rest rooms and showers were very clean. The only other campers were a fifth wheel, the absent host's beat-up trailer and a guy living in the back of his pick-up. Casino website has been out-of-date for years, but they say they can't correct it. We'll go elsewhere next time. We camped here in a Motorhome.
Came here to stay one night as we wanted to see Diamon Crater (a waste of time as it turned out). Arrived at the campground and only one trailer was there and it was a piece of junk with lots of trash around it. Turned out it was the hosts trailer. We did not stay. Drove 20 miles to the west and stayed at a nice BLM campground. We camped here in a Motorhome.
This campground is ok for an overnight stop. Not all sites have 50A, some are 30A only but are marked as such. Sites are nearly level, and just long enough for a 40' motorhome and towed. Roads and sites are gravel. Casino is up a hill. No office, just a camp host that hasn't showed up yet to collect the rent. We camped here in a Motorhome.
Basic parking lot RV park. Sites gravel and not very level. Okay for an overnight. Casino has a restaurant that offers reasonable priced meals. If you don't want to unhook or cook, this will work. Very quiet. We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.
This is a satisfactory place for an overnight stay. Sites were level and utilities worked fine. Nice and quiet for sleeping. There were a lot of wasps around, though. They appeared to like the trees in the campground. So beware. If it had Wi-Fi, we probably could have rated it higher. Nothing fancy but would probably stop again if we just needed a place to stay for one night. We camped here in a Motorhome.
We stayed here in 40' quad-slide motorhome with tow vehicle. There are only a few sites that are level. Good for overnight as the park is open, easy to get to, full hookups with 50 amp and a $5.00 match play slip. Casino is very small but has a restaurant. We would probably stay here again, if we came this way. We camped here in a Motorhome.
For an overnighter on the way to visit the slot machine store - you can't call the 'casino' anything else but that - it's a good stop. Easy in and out. Clean. Quiet. Easy access for satellite set up. We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.
This campground should only be considered if you are going specifically to the Casino. Most of the sites were uneven and required some type of leveling. It was over priced for what was available. We noticed on our way out of town the next morning on hwy 20 West, that there were other unlisted campgrounds available. We also observed a town park and truck stop on the west side of town that was being used as a free overnight dry camp by other RV's. We probably wouldn't stay here again. We camped here in a Fifth Wheel.
This is by no means a fancy campground. It's affiliated with a tiny (and I MEAN tiny) Indian casino, The Old Camp Casino. The campground is an open area with no shade between sites (there are young trees in boxes between the sites). The sites are all pull-through, made of gravel and not particularly level. No pool or anything like that. The bathroom and shower areas are very clean, though, which is nice. Burns is in the high desert of Oregon which means that there tends to be a wind and the nights, even in the Summer, can be chilly. The camp host, Doug, is a very nice guy who was helpful to us first-time RV'ers. The campground is a short walk or an even shorter drive (30 seconds perhaps) from the casino. It should be noted that the casino is EXTREMELY small and closes at 11 PM from Sunday to Thursday. It's open until 2 AM on weekends. This is not a campground I'd go out of my way for, but if you were in Burns, Oregon for some reason and wanted to stay the night cheaply, it's certainly adequate. As of June 2004, the campground offers a special: pay for five nights, stay seven. We camped here in a Motorhome.",en,unknown

AP Graders of Reddit, what is the most ridiculous thing you have ever read on a test you were grading? by PuppiesOnStiltsin AskReddit
[–]NeauxWai 0 points1 point2 points 12 days ago*
I love this. Good luck!
Also, I grew up using (moveable-do) solfege. In college, for dictations, I found it easiest to do quick ""stick"" notation of rhythms (not on the staff) and write solfege letters above them. Then I could go back and write in the music later and I would always get the rhythm right at least. But if you have a system that's worked for you all year don't try to change it completely now...
And draw a piano keyboard on your test. Seriously. Juniors in college still do it and it is helpful for dictating, intervals, and analyzing.

What is something that your body does that worries you (but not enough to ask a doctor about it)? by charlesofdensenin AskReddit
If it's accompanied by sharp surface level pain in your butthole you probably have anal fissures. Basically, your sphincter is not flexible enough and your poos are too big and you're tearing the inside of your sphincter. The treatment I have heard is stool softeners and changing your fiber intake (both too much and too little can cause this). You want to let the cut(s) heal.
If you're not getting anal fissures and there is no pain or the pain is much deeper or it's blood actually in your stool, see a doctor.
Something similar happens to me. On the front of my neck, usually right beside my larynx, it will feel like my muscles are all tangled up and it hurts a lot. I can also ""pop"" the muscles/joints/whatever is there at will but sometimes will get it all ""tangled"" then too. This has been going over a decade.
I don't know if that made sense.

I don't understand why this is an issue. Clara doesn't have a key to the TARDIS; this happens all the time. Can someone clarify why this is being treated differently than other times the TARDIS is locked?
And to note: the Doctor gave Victorian Clara a key, which proves to me that the redesign does still need a key.
But I do like your theory. I'm always looking for a good classic reference in new Who.

"Jaitley reaching Bangalore on trouble-shooting mission
Posted on: 18 May 2012
Bangalore/New Delhi: The Bharatiya Janata Party's 's senior leader Arun Jaitley is rushing to Bangalore Friday on a trouble-shooting mission to defuse the crisis in the state's faction-ridden ruling party following a revolt by a beleaguered former chief minister B.S. Yeddyurappa and his loyalists.
'The party's central leadership has deputed Jaitley and Dharmendra Pradhan (in-charge of party affairs in Karnataka), to Bangalore to hold talks with our state unit leaders and cadres,' state unit president K.S. Eshwarappa told reporters in Bangalore Thursday.
BJP sources in New Delhi earlier said Jaitley would be visiting Bangalore to take stock of the situation.
Though scam-hit Yeddyurappa held back his threat to leave the party or destabilise the eight-month-old D.V. Sadananada Gowda government, his decision Thursday to set up his own party office in Bangalore Friday and leave the official residence by this month-end has stoked fresh trouble for the leadership.
'We will discuss with Jaitley and Pradhan all issues, including Yeddyurappa's demand for convening the legislature party meeting, cabinet expansion and party's candidates for the upcoming legislative council by-elections (June 10) to ensure the party and the government focus on the state's development hereafter,' Eshwarappa stressed.
A day after the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) raided houses of Yeddyurappa and his two sons and his son-in-law in Bangalore and Shimoga Wednesday as part of its probe into the graft charges levelled against them in the multi-crore mining scam, Yeddyurappa said he would vacate the official residence by June 1 to avoid embarrassing the party and the government, as he was only a lawmaker now and not holding any post in the party or the government.
'I am opening a separate office to make it convenient for the people and party members, including cadres, to meet me freely to seek my advice or help as I will continue to serve the people as before,' Yeddyurappa told reporters after a meeting with his loyalists and supporters.
Jaitley and Pradhan will also call on Yeddyurappa to ascertain his demands or grievances in an effort to resolve the differences in the party's state unit.
In a related development earlier in the day, the CBI special court adjourned hearing on the anticipatory bail application of Yeddyurappa to May 25 after the central probe agency counsel petitioned the court that the case should be heard by a special judge and not by the vacation bench of the trial court.
Fearing imminent arrest, Yeddyurappa, his two sons B.Y. Vijayendra and B.S. Raghavendra and son-in-law R.N. Sohan Kumar moved the CBI court Wednesday for anticipatory bail after the Supreme Court May 11 directed the CBI to probe corruption charges against them in the alleged mining scam.
Yeddyurappa May 12 claimed securing resignations of nine state ministers loyal to him in a bid to force the party's leadership to replace Gowda -- originally his chosen successor -- with another person of his choice.
Though Yeddyurappa Monday indicated he would resign from the party, he later claimed that he had put off the decision following calls from party chief Nitin Gadkari as well as Jaitley.",en,web
"Opportunism rears its head in Trayvon protests
I don’t know all the facts behind the recent killing of Trayvon Martin in Florida. However, rather than mobs and threats and political theater, cooler heads and reasonable people would allow the justice system to perform its duty and remain a bulwark against vigilantism and mob rule.
The real question, in my opinion, centers on selective rage and political ideology forced into this tragedy. My question is this: If Trayvon had been killed in his mother’s womb at a Planned Parenthood clinic instead of on the streets years later, would the same groups of people, including Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton and other so-called black leaders, be just as incensed? Would they have held press conferences and protested outside of that clinic? Would militant black gangs issue death threats to the doctors who killed Trayvon in the womb, or wouldn’t Trayvon have mattered then?
Is selective rage determined by what stage of life the child is killed? I doubt if any of these questions will enter the minds of those now engaged in personal and political theater, because they are more interested in pushing a political agenda and are using the tragic death of this young man as their stage. There should be shame somewhere in their midst, but I doubt there is.

New Jersey a model for the country
According to a recent report from the Center for Public Integrity, New Jersey has the highest rating for corruption-busting in the United States (“Corruption? Fuhgeddaboudit — In a study of all 50 states, New Jersey rises to the top for resistance to official misconduct,” March 19). New Jersey’s new distinction may surprise many who have characterized the mid-Atlantic state as a media-hyped amalgam of neurotic mobsters, spoiled beach bums and crass politicians who love sticking it to the Big Apple just across the Hudson River.
However, I am not surprised that the Garden State has earned such high marks. Ever since Gov. Chris Christie — an experienced federal prosecutor who attacked waste, fraud and crooked politicians — came to office, he has cut spending, drastically lowered New Jerseyans’ tax burden and stopped all wasteful public projects. Swearing to limit government and cut cozy handouts to public-sector unions, Gov. Christie and the Legislature have put the needs of the voters ahead of party and political partisanship.
No longer a thoroughfare for corruption, New Jersey is an example of limited government as the essence of good government. Statehouses across the country must also learn that pilfering the public pursue, even in the name of public good, only reaps corruption. By pruning back the size and scope of the state, any governing body can ensure the life and vitality of the entire body politic.
Once again, I hope that the voters in New Jersey take pride in having elected an executive who stood by his word, and by doing so stood up for the best interests of the voters, the state and the country.

Roll out a train for beerfest patrons
My friends and I will be attending the Atlantic City Beerfest tonight. The session runs from 7 to 11 p.m. More than 25,000 people are expected to attend over the three daily sessions this weekend.
Last year, we took the NJ Transit train to Atlantic City. It’s convenient, as we don’t have to worry about driving and the train drops us off right at the Convention Center, where the Beerfest takes place. Last year, NJ Transit had a westbound train scheduled to leave around 11:40 p.m.
That train is no longer on the schedule. The Atlantic City Beerfest creates a unique situation that requires a train to depart between 11:30 and 11:45 p.m. that night. I suggest that they keep a train in service to depart during those times to allow people attending the Beerfest to head home at a decent hour.
I am afraid that people will be encouraged to drive drunk, as many people who read the train schedule find there is no westbound train leaving Atlantic City after the Beerfest until 12:43 a.m., and will instead opt to drive to and from Atlantic City instead of waiting almost two hours for a train to take them safely home.
Some may argue that the Beerfest patrons who need to take the train home should just leave the event earlier to make the 10:33 train; however, we all know that we don’t make our best judgments after more than three hours of drinking, nor do we move with the swiftness we should.
The solution is to push the 10:33 p.m. train back to 11:30 or to add another train at 11:30-11:45 p.m., for the safety of everyone.

At Emily Fisher school, students matter
I can’t speak for all charter schools, but Emily Fisher Charter School in Trenton serves underprivileged kids who were falling through the cracks of their own district. The school, slated to close in June by the New Jersey commissioner of education (“Fisher Charter friends rally at DOE to fight to stay open,” March 29), is a caring and vibrant community that supports kids who are on the edge academically.
Emily Fisher helps turn these kids around — and keeps them off the street. In doing so, it literally saves lives. Since my sister began teaching art there a few years ago, I’ve heard her tell stories of the headmaster driving in his van around Trenton, scooping up delinquent kids and taking them back to school. This is a school that matters.
How can this caring community be on the chopping block? Because of the argument that charters are taking away money from regular schools. It’s not always about money. Sometimes, it’s about people. Sometimes, it’s about keeping hope alive.

’Stand Your Ground’ laws protect innocent victims
The letter “ ‘Stand Your Ground’ law shields vigilantes” (March 27) attacks the NRA (National Rifle Association) by stating that it twists the meaning of the Second Amendment, scaring American citizens.
The NRA is the oldest civil rights organization in the U.S., and its membership is a cross-section of all citizens who value their freedom. The Second Amendment is an individual right — as intended by the authors of the Constitution. This was validated by the U.S. Supreme Court in District of Columbia vs. Heller and McDonald vs. Chicago.
In addition, it is the anti-gun lobbyists who are scaring American citizens by demonizing the more than 100 million gun owners in the U.S. They fail to report that gun sales are at an all-time high and more states than ever have “Right to Carry” laws, yet violent crime is the lowest in 37 years, according to the FBI. More guns, less crime.
How many of the deaths due to persons using a firearm, which the letter writer cited, were caused by criminals? How many by police and law-abiding citizens?
“Stand Your Ground” laws are needed to protect innocent victims. Criminals who try to hide behind them to commit crimes are not tolerated by prosecutors and grand juries. If these are not doing their jobs, they must be taken to task in the name of justice.
It is President Barack Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder who are trying to twist the meaning of the Second Amendment by stating it is a “collective right” (whatever that means). President Obama has been against the Second Amendment since his earliest days in Chicago. This is the position from the president, who has sworn to defend and protect the Constitution.

"Bloomberg: Claims for unemployment insurance payments in the U.S. unexpectedly fell last week to a four-month low, signaling the recent slowdown in payroll gains was caused by a lack of hiring rather than more firings.
First-time applications for jobless benefits decreased 7,000 in the week ended Aug. 6 to 395,000, the fewest since early April … Economists forecast 405,000 claims … The number of people on unemployment benefit rolls and those getting extended payments also dropped.
… The four-week moving average, a less-volatile measure of initial claims, dropped to 405,000, also the lowest since April, from 408,250.
… The number of people continuing to collect jobless benefits dropped by 60,000 in the week ended July 30 to 3.69 million. The decrease was the biggest since February….
…. The unemployment rate among people eligible for benefits, which tends to track the jobless rate, fell to 2.9 percent in the week ended July 30, today’s report showed. Forty-four states and territories reported a decrease in claims, while nine had an increase.
Initial jobless claims reflect weekly firings and tend to fall as job growth – measured by the monthly non-farm payrolls report – accelerates…..
The trade deficit widened 4.4 percent to $53.1 billion from $50.8 billion in May, a report from the Commerce Department showed today. The deficit exceeded all estimates in a Bloomberg News survey of economists in which the median was $48 billion. Exports declined the most since January 2009.

"Posts Tagged chasing algorithm
Almost every online business nowadays has a SEO campaign with various rates of success. The success of any SEO campaign is largely determined by the targeted traffic it is able to deliver to the website. Traffic is increased by researching for the most relevant and popular keywords. Once the keywords have been selected, a website is optimized and a link building campaign is initiated. Hopefully, if dome correctly and consistently, all these activities result in a website rankings for all or many of its selected keywords.
But over the last few years, SEO has evolved. It is no longer about delivering traffic to a website but also encompasses analytics.
Usually, a SEO company will do the needful and deliver the traffic. If and when a search engine updates its algorithm, the campaign is tweaked accordingly. This becomes a never ending cycle where the bulk of efforts are spent on chasing algorithms. Rather than building a website according to your initial goals, the focus of an algorithm chasing SEO consultant is now what a site should be as dictated by the latest algorithm update.
With every algorithm, SEO consultant will be frantically making changes to the site’s SEO campaign but by the time SEO consultant is done with them next update m ay be around the corner.
Also, algorithm chasing means overwhelming attention on just one search engine at the cost of other search engines. This means putting all your eggs in one basket which is not a wise decision when you business depends overwhelmingly on your online presence.
Chasing algorithm means creating a one size fits all solution which takes in to account various signals which can affect the SEO of a site. But as we know such solutions don’t work across industries and niche. Such an approach can be a perfect recipe for disaster if followed to a T.
Chasing analytics is a better technique than chasing algorithms because it forces you to concentrate on much better and tangible statistics which make more sense.
Analytics involves focusing on your audience and serving them with best way possible. This is how search engines actually want the sites to perform in the first place. This also saves SEO consultant from always figuring how to game search engines or how to get off the penalty imposed during last update.
But analytics is only successful if you have considerable traffic. Without any traffic even the best designed and most UX friendly site may fail.
To get the best of any SEO campaign, a SEO consult should marry analytics with their SEO campaigns if possible. A traffic may not necessarily be converted in to sales and it’s here the power of analytics can be unleashed. Analytics can unearth user behavior and trend which can help a site convert visitors in to customers.
This will mean a much more successful website which doesn’t need to be tweaked with every algorithm update.",en,reference
"Almost exactly a year ago, I took my first bare-foot steps into the chilly waters of self-publishing, and released my collection The Other Room. Some of these stories had already been published in magazines, but most were new to the world. I honestly had no idea how the book would be received, either in terms of sales or reviews.
Fortunately, it's gone far, far better than I ever imagined. I mean, a book that cites Robert Aickman as an influence in its blurb is never going to be the next Twilight but by my own standards The Other Room has sold well, and the responses from readers from been both humbling and exciting. And at least one person let me know in an email that they bought it because of the Aickman reference.
The book also featured in the 2011 Red Adept Reviews Indie Awards short story category.
The Other Room is available on Amazon (UK | US | GE | FR | ES | IT) and Smashwords.
And to celebrate, for the next week it is available for free from Smashwords, if you enter the following code at the checkout: QD54K. If you do pick up a copy, I'd love to know what you think of it.

"Meet Jud Lester: Paranormal Investigator.
When a crime is committed and the police are at a loss, the Covert Response Youth Paranormal Team (or CRYPT for short) is called in to figure out whether something paranormal is at work. Jud is their star agent. Jud, unwillingly paired with new recruit Bex, has just landed his biggest case yet...people have been disappearing in mysterious circumstances while others are viciously attacked - yet there are no suspects and a complete lack of hard evidence. The only thing that links each attack is the fact that survivors all claim that the culprits were 17th century highwaymen. Can Jud and Bex work out what has caused the spirits of these dangerous men to return to the streets of London before they wreak more death and destruction?
The Epitaph (In a Nutshell): A great start to what will prove to be an excellent paranormal investigation series. Also, the gore is spot on!
We are gathered here today to discuss CRYPT: The Gallows Curse by Andrew Hammond. It took me a little bit to get into this - the prologue felt a little too info-heavy for me, and I would've liked it woven into the story more naturally. But once I got to the first ghostly highwayman attack, I was back on track and loving it. I've made no attempts to hide my love of gore in the past, and this book has some wonderfully gory scenes - the shorter chapters containing ghost attacks are like little jewels in the crown of the story. My standout favourite scene has to be when one of the ghosts pulls a woman into a wall. The description of it is brilliant, and has to be read to be believed.
Jud did get on my nerves a little, but then, I think he was supposed to - the cocky, angry son of a billionaire who gets everywhere on a speeding motorbike and tends to rate fellow female CRYPT operatives on how attractive they are is probably not going to be anyone's best friend. But he did grow on me as the story progressed, and I enjoyed the partnership between him and Bex.
In all, this is a solid start to what should prove to be a very interesting series. The premise of the book and the mythology of its secret society is one that will immediately appeal to fans of action horror, myself included, and I eagerly await more adventures from Jud, Bex, and the rest of the Covert Response Youth Paranormal Team.",en,books
"Social Security Payments increase by 3.6% for 2012!
The amount taken (withholding) from your taxes for 2011 is down 2%. For employees, it is down from 6.2% to 4.2%.
For self-employed it is down from 12.4% to 10.4%.
Unless the law is changed, the tax rates will revert for 2012 to 6.2 percent and 12.4 percent.
This site was created as a response to the many questions that retirement age people, as well as younger people, have about their future.
The series of questions and answers will hopefully resolve many of the problematic issues about Social Security, and give you the information that you are looking for.
In 2017 Social Security
Will be in trouble paying out more than is coming in from taxes.
By 2033 our Social Security funds
The Social Security Trust Funds will run out for disability and retirement income programs, although the payments to people can continue at approximately three-quarters of the full amount.
That is as it stands now unless something drastic is done.
In the past people felt secure in the knowledge that our government's social security plan would protect us as we grew older and needed to retire or if we became disabled.
It was/is the bulwark against financial disaster for your spouse and children if you die.
The picture is not always so rosy now that the economy has taken a turn for the worse.
So as, we answer your most often asked questions here about the current situation with social security and the future of it all we certainly hope you will be able to rest easy...for now.
The current thinking for most people approaching retirement age is that they should have saved a nest egg for the future.
Younger people are the ones most in peril because the future might not be able to sustain the program that would sustain them in retirement or disability.
The younger you are the better off you will be as far as planning to create a more secure future because you have more time to prepare.
It's a good idea to be informed about taxes, and what you earn, and what credits and programs of which you can take advantage.

"YOU CAN CALL ME KARMA
CHAPTER 1 - PATCHES OF GREEN
The mid-January day was mild for the time of year, but it was a cold wind circulating from the Atlantic (or so the weather forecast said) that left shivers down the spine, roses on cheeks and runny noses. The rain clouds spread across the midday sky didn't have even the smallest break in its perfect sheet of deep grey, but only threatened a downpour. Typical weather for Manchester; it didn't rain as much as its reputation suggested, but sunshine seemed an irregular occurrence even in the Summer months. Being it during the lunching hours of the Wednesday workers, hoards of people littered the city centre; the town rich with all different ethnicities who moved as one down towards the 'Arndale' in search of food and a warm drink to keep them satisfied. A yellow topped, white tram heading past the people and shops began to screech to a halt at its second to last destination, 'Piccadilly Gardens', with a fresh crowd exiting its doors and entering the Gardens itself. It boasted a rather central spot in the middle of the busy town, and a large statue of Queen Victoria amidst the fountains, civilians and patches of green.
After finishing rolling the thin cigarette he placed it between his dry lips, watching from his seat on the platform the third tram he'd seen that day rock slowly up until it came to a stop in front of him, blocking his view of the Gardens. Folding the pouch of fresh tobacco with thin, bony fingers, he slid it back into the right hand pocket of his dark green Barber jacket, which hadn't seen a new coating of wax in a good few years at least. This left it with a rather musty smell and rugged look, which added age to the young man's pale complexion; his face lightly dotted in brown stubble which hadn't yet matured properly, and thick brown brows to match his thick head of hair, suitably short on the back and sides and swept towards and past his crown on the left side.
Reaching into the pocket of his skinny denim jeans, he revealed a blue, plastic lighter which showed a large picture of an ancient fleet ship printed on its side, glorious white sails held aloft by a proud mast, the ship gliding across a relatively calm blue sea on a clear day. Yet this added no class to the cheap lighter itself which was now held to his mouth with one hand, guarded by the other, and with a single click a flame emerged and engulfed the tip of the cigarette until it could hold its own against the wind now stinging his lightly crafted cheek bones. His gaze seemed held by the fountain in the centre of the gardens, but in actual fact he was staring at nothing; his vision blurred out of focus by his forever tired looking greyish blue eyes, with his mind in deep thought about the target of today's outing, coupled with everyday thoughts that troubled him but of which he had gotten used to. By the expressionless face he generally showcased, anyone would have thought he had no concerns, but it seemed a formality to him to fake the emotions he couldn't feel. His emotional range was only caught between nothingness and deep depression, which enclosed a whole host of mental issues he kept to himself and his therapist. Trouble seemed to meet him and he seemed to seek it in kind, the former of the two beginning the never ending cycle of disaster and drama.
But it was what he was here for, the 'mission' he had set himself for the day that was at the forefront of his mind. And here it was, pulling itself along the tracks just like the rest of the trams he had seen that day, but this one caught his eye particularly. He was always punctual; never late for anything and despised those who made him wait. His leg twitched due to the cold wind seeping through the denim onto the skin of his legs, but it was also a habit he had picked up to calm his nerves, his only tell. He watched discreetly, casually, as the tram reeled itself slowly towards the platform, the forth he had seen while he waited and most importantly the one he had been waiting for. Across the front and back of its bold frame it read 'Piccadilly' in orange text, which was the last stop it would meet on its journey from Altrincham only to turn and do it all again in reverse. The impatient passengers were already stood and pressed against the doors, those still sat were either going on further or showing their experience of tram travel, not needing to stand until the doors had opened.
He spied him out of the corner of his eye. The man he was after, sat with his face just revealing from 'The Metro' newspaper and beginning to exit with the rest of the crowd. He wore a black coat draped over a neat, light grey suit and smartly polished black shoes. Nothing gave him away from any other well dressed, modestly built middle-aged man that regularly scurried around the great town apart from a noticeably large mole that looked out of place resting above his upper lip; the kind that had a few black hairs sprouting from its core and stuck out so much it seemed almost to be trying to escape his aged face. His black hair highlighted white wisps in most places, and was short, which didn't help hiding his hairline which was receding quicker than a tide before a disastrous tsunami. Bags sagged firmly under his deep set, green eyes which hung over his large, pointed nose, the rest of his face had few flaws other than the odd wrinkled crevice and roughened skin which was cleanly shaved, generally looking rather well for a man of his age.
The young man made it his first priority to not give anything away as his target strolled leisurely past him. He'd finish his cigarette first, it only had a few drags left in it which would give him a good distance to follow without letting on; after all, he didn't know how long he would need to follow him for, it was most likely going to be a good few hours. He knew who the man was, and had been following him since Monday, but knew that he would be nothing more than a funny sensation of déjà vu to him. Even in his tender age he had almost perfected his art.
His cigarette finished, he flicked it away on to the tracks and began to exit the platform, turning to his left. His target still in sight, he set his pace, his eyes fixated on the man who was just crossing the tracks a fair distance ahead of him, heading towards the busy street that led up to the Arndale food court. he had to be smart from here, keeping close through the crowds but not being obvious about it-just two people on their way for some lunch, no different from everyone else. But this wasn't even the tricky part, this was merely collecting information before the night's conclusion to the day's outing; the calm before the storm.
They entered the crowds, the best thing about Manchester was that no one rushed, even in the peak hours it was all very relaxed, nonchalant. There was no pushing, no aggression in the masses; the worst you had to worry of was a dozy shopper, and that only required an adjustment in your stride. He thought of nothing but his target now, his gaze firmly locked on the man; he was a fair bit smaller than his target, maybe a few inches. Smoking from an early age had stunted his growth but he had settled at a proud five-foot nine-inches, just under the national average height for an adult male. Insomnia had prematurely aged his face and mind, suffering for three years of the eighteen he had existed (each night generally spared him scraps of sleep, usually around three hours).
He was so focused on his target, he didn't even notice the ragged homeless man busking next to one of the many benches that had been bolted down the centre of the road. He played his acoustic guitar and sang a Bob Dylan song rather huskily; the few coins that had been flung into his case didn't reflect the quality of his performance, but not many were interested, the city was musically gifted enough. Another street performer a little way further along had gathered more of a crowd, including the target, who had stopped to watch the man juggle four pins at once. He couldn't be obvious-he had to stop short of the juggler as to not arouse suspicion. The young man stopped and leant against a shop in front of the display window, the intricate plucking of the old acoustic guitar hit his ears, as too did the worn voice. 'Don't Think Twice, It's All Right', he thought, recognising the Bob Dylan song when he had taken time to stop and notice it. But his eyes were still fixated on his target, yet his ears were momentarily lost to the sweet music, and it took him back to the first time he heard it and a wave of depression quivered his lip, but his lack of emotion quickly straightened it.
He almost didn't notice the man exit the crowd, a smirk now slapped across his face through enjoyment of the juggling act.
""Good stuff pal,"" he said to the homeless man in a croaky voice, slipping a five pound note from out of his back pocket and discarding it into the guitar case, his eyes still on the target. The old man didn't stop playing, but gave him a nod in appreciation of his recognition and generosity, his eyes slightly welling up but his act no worse. It wasn't long before the middle-aged man had cut short his journey down the road, turning into a small coffee shop. It wasn't a chain shop like the Starbucks and Cafe Nero that they had passed nearer the Gardens, but a nice little haven; a family-owned shop that had a homely feel to it, an escape from the busy centre almost. The young man waited a few moments outside the shop, which was fairly busy, making sure his entrance wasn't much noticed-he didn't want to draw attention. Above the shop door read 'Hot Drinks', 'Cold Drinks', 'Sandwiches', 'Snacks', and in bolder letters the shop name 'Tea-Hive' with a picture of a bee drinking a cup of tea. He cringed a little at the annoyingly obvious play on words, before opening the door. A little bell sounded as he entered, but it wasn't taken any notice of as the rest of the customers were either reading or engaged I conversation, and the two people serving at the counter were preoccupied.
The middle-aged man was already sat by a small table opposite an empty chair, sipping at his fresh coffee every once in a while in-between reading his newspaper. The radio sounded quietly, some Chart music was playing and the young man made a disapproving face as he approached the counter. A young woman greeted him with a half-hearted smile, her dyed red hair that showed streaks of natural brown tied back into a pony tail (as was policy in the shop) revealing the full beauty of her healthy complexion. He stared into her eyes and was lost for a moment in their blue; it was almost as if they expressed the radiant sky that lay behind the rain clouds of the Winter's day.
""Hi, what can I get you?"" she asked, routinely. As he watched her full rosy lips, painted neatly with rouge lipstick, it struck him that she must have said the exact same thing to a thousand other people.
""Tea,"" he replied. He wasn't much for words unless he had something profound to say, and she had quite intimidated him. Her appealing uniqueness, her pale skin that hadn't a blemish upon it, only a small beauty spot that sat comfortably upon her right cheek. ""Please,"" he added, remembering common courtesy. He'd never seen it himself, but he didn't want a worker taking a disliking to him, his drink tainted with their saliva and mixed in so that he never knew. He hated the stuff; wouldn't share drinks or food, and dismissed people who spat while they talked. But he almost wouldn't mind if she did, in a way that he recognised to be weird and a little creepy - he hadn't the charm nor the looks, or so he thought. It was the closest he would get to being with her.
""Are you sitting in or having it to go?"" she questioned, but he was so taken now by her perfect physique (or what he could see of it) that the simple question wasn't quite processing. He paused for a short while, trying to remember what she had said. 'Her sweet voice' he thought, in attempt to recall from his mind what it had uttered, cursing his hormones as he searched.
""To go. But I'll sit in,"" the young man said, turning to check that the man was still there. He followed, ""one sugar, drop o' milk."" Turning back towards the counter, he found the young woman staring at him. His heart skipped, and all the reasons why their blue eyes momentarily met in silence raced through his mind until the crushing truth of reality met him in disappointment.
""You're a million miles away,"" she said, confusing him.
""I said 'two pounds please',"" she laughed, holding out her hand, waiting for the change. He rooted around in his back pocket again and pulled out a handful of change, quickly picked out two pound coins from it, and placed them gently in her outstretched hand. ""Thanks,"" she laughed again, lightly, ""it'll just be a minute. If you find a place I'll bring it to you."" She smiled, this time seeming more genuine, and he returned the favour with the best smile he could muster, his mouth just upturned slightly in the left corner.
He hadn't even seen him come in but his target had company, and had filled the empty seat that previously sat quietly opposite. The young man had taken a small table against the wall, yet stuck within ear shot of the middle-aged man, who had now laid his newspaper down onto the varnished wood to engage fully in conversation. His tea had yet to arrive, but that wasn't the reason he had entered the cafe; he was here on business, the hot drink was just a cover. A spare paper had been left on the table, presumably by a customer before himself, which would add further camouflage amidst the chatty customers. He hadn't bothered to remove his jacket, and sat with his left leg crossed over the other; his right arm rested on a polished wooden partition that divided his table from the few behind him, his other hand now grasping 'The Mirror' newspaper as he casually pretended to read. Focusing his ears, he deciphered the conversation of interest among the buzz of the rest of the customers, or rather, the rest of the bees chatting away in the 'Tea-Hive'.
""You got to come, Pete,"" the man said to the target, ""It's Jimmy's birthday, he won't forgive ya' if ya' didn't."" his hands were pressed firmly on the table as he leant forward, his podgy, hairy belly poking out from his navy sports jacket and slightly hanging over the brown belt fastened to his light denim jeans. Pete laughed slightly, lifting his hand from the comfort of his knee and showing a wedding ring, pointing at it with the other hand.
""The Mrs, mate. She'll never let me, not tonight anyway,"" he joked, taking another sip from his coffee cup. The man lifted a pleading hand from the table, leaving a sweaty hand print where it lay.
""Don't be a prick, man. It's just a fuckin' drink,"" he replied, attempting to convince his friend. The young man listened intently, his eyes still on the newspaper, the headline reading '""I KILLED TWO COPPERS"": man confesses to murder'.
""Alright alright, calm down Bill, I'll fuckin' go then,"" Pete gave in, the young man trying to refrain from grimacing. He'd only been there an hour and a half that day, but his objective was close to completion. He only needed to find out where they were going and he was done.
""Good stuff, knew ya' weren't gonna let me down,"" Bill said in disguised elation, ""meet us at 'The Ram's Head' at about nine-ish, yeah?"" The young man knew exactly where the pub was - not that far from their current location, around a ten minute walk towards the outskirts of the centre, and it would be fairly quiet.
Pete's head turned down slightly, knowing he was about to get a further pestering from his companion, ""Yeah, that's fine. I'll have t' leave 'bout twelve though, got work tomorro' ya'know.""
""Fuck, when'd you 'come such a pussy?"" he teased, ""Suppose that'll have t' do then. Sure we can get a few down ya'.""
'The trap's set,' the young man thought, 'this is going to be easy enough'. He coughed a little as the consequence of the cigarette from earlier unsettled from his throat, and he wondered why his drink hadn't arrived yet. Checking the counter, he noticed the young woman beginning to approach with his tea; her light grey jeans clinging to perfect legs and large hips, only slightly covered by her apron tied around her waist that had the same picture and name from the front of the shop.
""I'll be off then,"" Bill said, forcing his chair back upon standing.
""Let me just finish this,"" Pete engulfed the remaining coffee and stood, placing the mug back down on to the table, ""I'll walk out with ya.'"" Both men walked from the table, squeezing through tables and customers. Pete lifted his hand and smiled in thanks to the other worker who remained serving at the counter, and they exited the shop. The young man didn't need to follow, he was done until tonight - and what a night it promised to be.
""Sorry for your wait,"" the young lady apologised, a smile on her face. He looked up and accepted the tea enclosed in a brown plastic cup with a white lid ensuring its contents were safe, and a cardboard sleeve around it's base so his hand wasn't burnt.
""No worries,"" he searched for some additional courage, ""Sit?""
She looked at him, her face expressing a little disappointment in herself, ""I would, but I'm dying for a cig.""
He smiled, his response hitting him immediately, ""Lucky I got this to go then,"" he said, his joke lying in the assumption she wanted him to join her. She laughed a little, taking an immediate comfort in his facade of confidence.
""You smoke?"" she asked with equal confidence, yet her heart beat as fast as his did at that moment. He answered with a nod, and quickly rolled a cigarette at the table before standing.
""You got a name then?"" he looked at her, his face returning to its regular, blank expression.
""Julie,"" she replied with an air of scepticism, ""And what can I call you?""
He gave a faint smile - he hadn't smiled so much in a long time, even if it was purely a disguise to appear normal. ""Jack,"" he said, the bell above the door ringing as they exited the shop.",en,books

PowerShell script to extract T-SQL task code from SSIS packages
Requirement Some time back I presented a PowerShell script which extracts T-SQL code from RDL files. Remember that I created this script to assist me in doing code reviews of ad-hoc SQL snippets which were embedded in the report definition files. Another common usage of ad-hoc T-SQL code is within SSIS...

PowerShell script to extract T-SQL code from RDL files
One of the things I do in my day job at Microsoft Services is to review database design and T-SQL code. Now, when it comes to code, there is a challenge just to find ALL the possible code which hits our database engine. This is because a non-trivial amount of T-SQL code is not in the form of Stored Procedures...

t-SQL Anti-Pattern: Index Key Order and Query Expression Order
This is really not a T-SQL anti-pattern as much as it is a database design issue, but we see it so often that it’s worthwhile bringing it up and clarifying things.

"It’s coming up on registration time. While there are many great courses offered at MSPP, it can be difficult to fit them in to our busy schedules, working around internship requirements. One option to get around these constraints is to create a directed study.
Students have created directed studies on such topics as play therapy, college counseling, men and masculinity, and Dissociative Identity Disorder. Currently, I am working with other students to study Internal Family Systems Theory (IFS).
Directed studies can be a great way to explore a specific area of interest. Additionally, because they are often taught by outside professors, students get the chance to meet other professionals in the field. A maximum of six students can enroll in a directed study, creating a setting where rich discussions can occur. The opportunities are endless – happy organizing!",en,reference
"Awlcraft 2000 is a fast drying, acrylic urethane high gloss topcoat for an easy-to-apply, high gloss finish. This Product MUST be sprayed. Not for use by brush/roller.
NOTE: Awlcraft 2000 is a 3 component system applied by spray only. When ordering AwlCraft 2000, you will need to choose the appropriate Converter and a Reducer.

T0001, T0002, T0003, or M.E.K. for Equipment Cleaning
Spray Application: 573 Sq. Feet at 1 mil (25 microns) dry film thickness; 230 SQ. Feet at recommended dry film thickness.
Recommended Wet Film Thickness: 6-9 mils (150-225 Microns), Total of 2-3 Coats.
Recommended Dry Film Thickness: 2-3 mils (50-75 Microns), Total of 2-3 Coats.
Recoatability: Spray applications consist of 2-3 coats applied over 1-4 hours. Exact time will vary with temperature, project size, and film thickness applied. Brush/Roller applications require at least 2 coats applied minimum of 16 hours apart. AwlCraft 2000 topcoats which have been allowed to dry more than 24 hours must be sanded before recoating.
Coverage calculations are calculated for mixed base and converter, reduced 25% and are based on a theoretical transfer of efficiency of 100%. Actual coverage rate obtained will vary according to equipment choice, application techniques, part size, and application environment.
Anticipated Cure Time at 77 F/ 50% R.H.: 24 hours to tape free, 3 days to light service, 14 days for full cure.
Best results are achieved when sprayed over properly prepared Awlgrip 545 Primer. May be applied directly over some existing finishes. The existing finish must be sound, tightly adhered to the substrate, and chemically compatible with the Awlcraft 2000.
Mixing and Reduction Spray:
Mix by volume 2 parts Awlcraft 2000 Topcoat Base Component with one part Awl-Cat #2 Spray Converter to a smooth homogenous mixture. Reduce 25%-33% with the spray reducers appropriate for conditions. Overall mix is 2:1:3/4-1 by volume. 25% reduction is a standard mix. Clear coats, metallic colors, and painting in high temperature conditions may require additional reduction up to 40%.
General: The primed surface must be clean and dry. Achieving maximum gloss and distinction of image requires the primer be smooth sanded with 220-320 grit paper before topcoat application. Using a contrasting mist coat of lacquer primer as a guide coat is recommended. Smooth sanding until all the guide coat is removed indicates a texture free surface. Two to three coats are recommended for spray applications.
Spray Application: Apply a light, smooth, slightly wet tack coat to the surface. Allow tack coat to flash off 30 to 45 minutes. Then apply a full, wet coat to achieve color coverage (ie hide) and film thickness requirements. If preferred, three coats may be used. Allow second coat to flash off 30 to 45 minutes until only slightly tacky before applying third coat. Coats 2 and 3 are not full wet coats in 3 coat applications. The second coat is a slightly heavy tack coat with the third coat just wet enough to obtain full hide (opacity) or color coverage. Do not apply to surfaces warmer than 105 F or colder than 55 F. Do not attempt to cure below 55 F.

"Arthur stared out at the village from the window of his room. He watched as the villagers went about their morning business, and the knights went about theirs. He watched as servants walked in and out of the castle. He watched as Guinevere left to run an errand for the Lady Morgana, and ran into Merlin on his way in. The pair stopped for several minutes to talk.
Didn't they have work to be doing? Who told them they could stop and shoot the breeze? Arthur certainly hadn't given Merlin permission to do so.
He could see them both laughing over a joke Merlin had told. Who said he could tell that joke? Who gave her permission to laugh at something he said?
Arthur realized, as he watched their conversation progress to an eventual end, that his jealousy was a bit ridiculous. However, knowing it did nothing to make him stop feeling it.
""Good morning, Sire,"" Merlin said, entering his room several minutes later. Arthur was still standing at the window, staring down at the people, though the object of his affections was no longer among them.
""Ever been in love, Merlin?"" Arthur couldn't help but ask.
""Ex-excuse me, Sire?""
""Have you ever been in love?"" Arthur repeated, turning to look at him.
Merlin pondered the question for a moment as he set the Prince's breakfast on the table. ""Yes, I suppose I have.""
""Then perhaps you could tell me something,"" Arthur said, as the servant began to help him into his armour. ""What do you do when such love is unrequited? When- when she looks at you, but doesn't even see you, because- she's too busy looking at someone else?""
""I don't know,"" Merlin said after a bit of thought. ""I haven't figured that bit out yet.""
""Oh please,"" Arthur said, almost laughing. ""I see the way Gwen looks at you. How could I complete with that?""
Merlin fumbled with the Prince's armour.
""I- I hadn't realized your feelings for Gwen were so deep,"" Merlin stuttered.
Arthur turned to look at Merlin. There was a look in the servant's eyes that made him want to risk everything.
""It's not Gwen I'm in love with,"" he said, looking away. ""It's you.""
The Prince's armour hit the ground with a loud clang. Arthur turned to look at Merlin. His mouth had fallen open and his eyes were wide.
""What did you say?"" he asked in disbelief.
""I'm in love with you,"" Arthur replied simply. There was no taking it back now.
Merlin stared at him, his mouth opening and closing repeatedly. It might have been almost humourous, in a different situation.
""Look, you don't-"" Arthur began, but was forced to stop when Merlin's lips collided with his own. Arthur responded quickly, running one hand through Merlin's hair, while the other arm looped around his waist, pulling them closer together until their bodies were pressed against each other.",en,books
"I am searching for some information about the Table Service, and I have the next question:
Is possible to query for entities using a non-defined key as criterion?
Thanks for your help.
Yes, it is entire possible to query for entities on attributes other than PartitionKey and RowKey, however please keep in mind that this will result in full table scan and depending on the size of your table you may get result very late. When you don't specify any query criteria, essentially you're fetching all entities from the table.

"Sometimes people die and come back to life. Sometimes they are zombies, sometimes they are reanimated by a t virus, and sometimes they were never dead at all.
Although there are a few publicity stunts noted below, we at Daft Gadgets feel that one person in particular deserves a more in depth look into their death and resurrection.
Some of you may remember that old Gilligan’s Island rerun where the crazed Japanese soldier in the submarine takes Gilligan and his island pals hostage, believing that World War II was not over.
What you may not know, is that this crazy sitcom skit wasn’t that far off from the truth.
Officially Declared Dead and Forgotten in 1959, Lieutenant Hiro Onoda (Not to be confused with Hiro “Nakamura”) survived the harsh conditions of the Philippines jungle for over 2 decades.
No, he wasn’t a zombie, he was just an MIA soldier who happened to be too far away to see the fat man drop on Hiroshima.
His dedication to the cause of Japan allowed him to keep high morale, while his military training ensured his survival in the jungle.
Onoda, was also not alone. During part of his time in Hades he had three other soldiers with him and was doing quite well strategically capturing Filipinos since most of them were unaware that WWII was still going on.
Although there were numerous attempts to inform Onoda that the war was over (via leaflet) Onoda believed these to be “Propaganda Tricks” and ignored them. Nobody knew what to do about him since he seemed to just randomly show up from the Jungle and disappear, he was after all trained as an Intelligence officer by the commando class “Futamata”.At first, some people thought he was a myth that some kids probably made up, but a shootout with local police in 1972 made some people begin to believe otherwise.
It would take a Japanese college dropout by the name of Norio Suzuki to begin a life quest to find 3 things:
- Lieutenant Onoda,
- A Panda bear, and
- The Abominable Snowman or “Yeti,”
in that exact order.
On February 20th 1974, Onoda and Suzuki met face to face in the Jungle and became friends. He told Onoda about the war but Onoda refused to give up until he received orders from a superior officer.
Suzuki returned to Japan with pictures of himself and Onoda as proof (in case they labeled him a one of those bigfoot crackpots) and the Japanese government in turn, located an old book seller by the name of Taniguchi, previously known as Major Taniguchi and Onoda’s commanding officer.
Major Taniguchi took his final mission and flew to Lubang on March 9th 1974 and ordered Onoda to surrender.
29 years after the end of WWII, Onoda emerged from the jungle and returned home to Japan. There he was welcomed as a hero and would later release his autobiography titled: “No Surrender: My Thirty Year War”
Other people who have been reported dead only to be alive include names like:
In the early 70s, there was a satirical obituary and concert review by Melody Maker magazine. Fans took it as literally as the Orson Wells alien hoax and Mr Cooper was forced to make a public statement that say he was:
“Alive, and drunk as usual”
Queen Elizabeth II
On May 17th 2010 a facebook member named Queen Elizabeth died, leading Danny Kelly BBC Host to play “God Save the Queen” and announce the Queen’s official death. Although meant as a joke, it didn’t go off well with Mr Kelly’s producer.
Apparently the BBC doesn’t endorse that type of sense of humor.
in 1888 Alfred read his obituary which labeled him the “Merchant of Death” The obit was actually a mix up for his brother, but it was enough to cause Alfred to change his will and create what we now know as “The Nobel Prize”
Other notable early obits include;
Joe Dimaggio, Ernest Hemingway, Paul McCartney, Mark Twain, George Bush, Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, Fidel Castro, Sean Connery, Russel Crowe, Bob Hope (Twice), Steve Jobs, and many, many more, including:
You may remember Luca Barbareschi from the film: “The International” as Umberto Calvini, an arms manufacturer who is an Italian Prime Ministerial candidate.
Or Maybe you don’t, but perhaps you will find the story of his death 28 years earlier a bit more memorable.
Luca was one of four actors believed to have been murdered during the making of the horror film,” Cannibal Holocaust” (not to be confused with the film Cannibal Hectare that doesn’t actually exist)
The film was so life like for its time, the Italian police arrested the film’s director Ruggero Deodato for murder, and didn’t release him for an entire year when Luca and the other actors appeared on television stating the murders weren’t a snuff film but a movie. (They didn’t come out to the press earlier because people believing the murders were real gave them free publicity)
Mr. Barbareschi later transformed his fame into a political career, becoming a member of the Italian Parliament.

"Women's Long Distance Running Committee 2011 Minutes
WLDR General Session #1
December 2, 2011
Committee chair Virginia Brophy Achman called the meeting to order at 8:06am.
All members of the WLDR Executive committee were asked to introduce themselves to those in attendance.
Secretary Mickey Piscitelli asked for approval of the WLDR meeting minutes from 2010 which had been available to all via the USATF document library.
Virginia made the motion. It was seconded by Nina Kuscsik. No discussion. Motion passed.
Virginia opened with the very good news that the winner of our 2011 WLDR Athlete of the Year Award was Janet Cherobon-Bawcom. Janet had come on very strong in the fall, and moved quickly to the top of the leader board of the USARC when she won 3 of our national championships – the 10 mile, 10K and 20K.
The name of the winner of our 2011 Marja Baker Contributor of the Year award will be revealed at the Awards Luncheon.
IAAF Technical Committee
David Katz reported that there is a new procedure in place for the addition and/or amendment of the Technical Rules. Now, as long as both the Technical Committee and the IAAF Council are in agreement, the IAAF can approve changes to the Technical Rules without going to a vote by the Congress. In fact, only three rules went to Congress: 141.1, 261, and 264. To summarize, the IAAF rule for age categories will now describe Masters men and women as age 35+, moving forward Women’s World Road Racing records will be attainable in women-only races, and performance data will be kept for Junior Indoor records.
David informed us that, regarding Rule 261 (Women’s World Road Racing Records), it had been erroneously reported that all standing records would be disregarded. According to David, there is a good chance that that rule can be reversed when the opportunity to do so comes up in 2 years.
Robert Hersh, who has been voted in for a four-year term as the newest IAAF Senior Vice President (Bob will now assume the role of President if the sitting President of the IAAF Council is unable to attend a meeting), stopped by to tell us of some of the highlights of the year. The shining star for 2011 was the World Championships in Daegu, Korea. He declared it a big success not only for Team USA, but for the IAAF as well as not only did the athletes enjoy great crowd support onsite, but television ratings throughout the world were very high. The other note-worthy events for 2011 were the World Cross Country Championships and the World Youth Championships.
Bob also shared a list of upcoming competitions:
July 12-August 12: Games of the XXX Olympiad in London, UK (Athletics being contested August 3 -12)
October 6: IAAF World Half Marathon Championships in Kavarna, Bulgaria
March 24: World Cross Country Championships in Bydgoszcz, Poland.
August 10-18: World Championships in Athletics in Moscow, Russia
Bob also pointed out that starting in 2013, athletes running the marathon will no longer need to qualify for the World Championships from a special list of particular marathons. It must be the case, however, that it be a record-worthy course.
For 2014: March: IAAF World Half Marathon in Copenhagen
September 13/14: Continental Cup in Marrakech, Morocco (commencing with this competition, each country may enter only two athletes for each event)
For 2015: August: World Championships in Beijing, China
For 2017: World Championships in London, UK
Kathy Nary reported that our athletes competed in November in Chiba, Japan at the Chiba Ekiden. Team USA placed 5th overall. The athletic performances on the mixed team were as follows:
1st Leg (5K): Robert Cheseret 13:38 3rd place
2nd Leg (5K): Alisha Williams 16:15 10th place
3rd Leg (10K): Christopher Landry 30:00 7th place
4th Leg (5K): Emily Brown 16:25 6th place
5th Leg (10K): Robert Mack 28:55 3rd place
6th Leg (7.125K): Janet Cherobon-Bawcom 23:53 5th place
Team USA alternates competed in a mixed 5K track race.
Wendy Thomas was 2nd out of 5 women in a time of 16:39
Josh Moen was 3rd out of 9 men in a time of 14:13
Bill McKee updated us on what discussions had taken place within the Rules Committee sessions.
A tabled item from 2010 was taken off the table this year and was the topic of much discussion. In 2010 it had been submitted by Jean Knaack, Executive Director of the Road Runners Club of America, on behalf of John Elliott. The reason for the new rule was to allow “US citizens who had not previously represented another country or territory in International Competition to be eligible to compete in the Championship”.
Bill went on to report that GPS devices can be worn by an athlete during a competition as long as that athlete does not use it to communicate in any way with another individual during the competition.
Athlete Development Program
ADP coordinator for WLDR, Linda Barnhart, reported on the championship races which participated in the program during 2011. There were a total of five.
She will continue to work collaboratively with Brian Jones, Men’s LDR ADP coordinator, on having our emerging elite athletes make the most of these opportunities for 2012.
A suggestion was made to include logo compliance language on ADP news releases in an effort to continue to educate the athletes regarding this issue.
Linda had on hand hard copies with details of the ADP including stipend amounts and services received as well as athlete eligibility standards. Interested athletes should visit http://www.usatf.org/groups/RoadRunning/elite/ADP.aso for the 2012 Championship events and ADP application.
The Chair encouraged session attendees to speak up about what was happening in their own associations. We went around the well-filled room and had members introduce themselves and give us a bit of information on what LDR successes they had had during 2011.
Dick Connors of the Pacific was proud to report that they had initiated 20 LDR officials.
Sonja Robinson from Georgia reported on the retirement of the highly respected Dr. David Martin and the bid that they had made for the 10K championships.
Joe Monks from Florida gave his usual enthusiastic verbal account of events in the Sunshine State as well as providing us with a hard copy of his report which included photos. To date there had been 7 LDR championships since last year’s Annual meeting. This included an inaugural event, the 1-Mile Road Championship held in Boca Raton. Also, two national LDR events were held within his association. One was the 15K Gate River Run in Jacksonville and the other was the Masters Half Marathon in Melbourne.
Lyle Clauson from the Dakotas spoke about the understandable frustration of trying to get association members together for races when your association runs approximately 550 miles from north to south and about 450 miles from east to west. He is very interested in trying to get a distance road racing series started in the two states. He mentioned that in 2012, they would be celebrating the 50th running of the Jack 15 Road Race. The 15.2 mile race is the oldest road race in South Dakota and the Midwest.
Elite athlete Emily Brown representing the Minnesota Association and one of our Team USA members at the Chiba Ekiden, reported on the popularity of the Runpro camp. The focus is to get more middle-tier college athletes to pursue distance running after graduation. Twenty athletes came out to the past year camp and as a result, two of them are now on board with team Minnesota and are competing in our USATF national championships.
Will Lindgren from the Nebraska Association reported that Team Nebraska-Brooks is also creating that bridge for post-collegiate athletes.
Latashia Key of Indiana said that she was surprised about how little athletes appear to know about post-collegiate competition opportunities. She wondered as to whether there could be more communication with college coaches.
Edwin Hampton of the Alabama Association reported that he is a high school coach and that he has been able to have some of his high school athletes compete unattached at the nearby college. He works at keeping the lines of communication open between college coaches and the community and/or high school coaches.
Sonja Robinson added that they have an athlete advisory committee within their Georgia association. The president of which is a Level 2 Coach Educator and so there is an open avenue for ongoing contact with many universities.
Some attendees were excited about new programs within their association. Starting in 2012, the Minnesota Association plans to start an athlete’s advisory piece within the framework of their association.
During 2011, the Pacific Association offered training grants for which area athletes could apply. Ten $1000 grants were awarded to athletes who live and compete within the jurisdiction of the Pacific Association and show potential for representing the U.S. in international competition.
It would be beneficial to have more athletes attending our Annual Meeting and applying to our established elite training centers. Kimberly Keenan Kirkpatrick thought that, if it were the case, and not all athletes who apply for funding to the Annual Meeting via the Athletes Advisory Committee, received funding; the names of those interested athletes might be passed along to their associations. The AAC provides funding for qualifying athletes to attend the USATF Annual Meeting based on a 3-tier system. Not all applying athletes may receive funding. We want to make these athletes aware that their opinion is wanted and valued.
Running USA CEO, Susan Weeks, reminded everyone that there is an annual grant which can still be applied for. Running USA is a non-profit industry organization with a mission of advancing, serving, and promoting the sport of running. In 2012, Running USA will be presenting the Allan Steinfeld Development Award to an established U.S. distance training group. All established U.S. distance training group have been invited to apply for this training group grant in the amount of $25,000. This will mark the third consecutive year for this generous monetary award.
Scott Keenan, executive director of Grandma’s Marathon in Duluth, Minnesota, added that Minnesota athletes can apply for a grant via the Minnesota Elite Athlete Development Program (MEADP). It was created by the Minnesota distance running community to provide financial assistance to elite Minnesota distance runners who have completed their academic running career. Grants are provided to assist qualified runners in reaching their fullest potential. Funding for these grants comes from the Grandma’s Marathon budget, the Twin Cities Marathon budget and the Minnesota Distance Running Association.
Lyle Clauson suggested that, in lieu of writing a check to a charity, associations keep some of the money raised and pump that money back into the sport.
According to Will Lindgren, Team Nebraska-Brooks holds a whole series of races and the profits do go back into Team Nebraska-Brooks. He did say that there might be some “back-lash” about this money going back to the runners.
Richard Finn, media director from New York Road Runners, added that a goal of NYRR is to give back to the running community.
The U.S. Distance Project, the financial, marketing and promotional partnership among major distance running events, major corporations, and USATF was mentioned as another avenue by which athletes can find support. The major partners are NYRR, the Medtronic Twin Cities Marathon, the Chevron Houston Marathon, and Marathonguide.com. Existing and emerging training centers are funded by grants which supplement funding for general operations as well as grants for coaching assistance, training summits and possibly sponsor recruitment.
The committee recessed at 9:50am.
WLDR General Session #2 December 2, 2011
The WLDR committee reconvened at 3:04 pm.
Men’s and Women’s LDR record keeper Andy Carr reported that he had three records ready for approval. All three were “all-comer” performances by Kim Smith. A motion was made by Mickey and seconded by Irene Herman. The records were unanimously approved. Andy reported that in the future there will be a change in the record submission process and that this would be the last time that he would attend a general WLDR session for the purpose of seeking record approval. Moving forward, all records will be reported to the LDR executive committee for approval.
WLDR representative for organizational services, Barb Palma, reported that some of the associations had been a bit slow in getting their delegate information submitted. The USATF Metropolitan Association was decertified and a new organization, named “USATF New York” has replaced it in terms of serving the five boroughs of New York City. This newly formed association must have elections by October 2012.
Barb also noted that the Alaska, Wyoming, and West Texas associations have no voting rights at this year’s Annual Meeting.
She reminded everyone that there would be no Annual Meeting site selection voting this year as we currently have venues approved through the year 2016.
After quickly switching hats, Barb continued by reminding the group that officials would be wise to have insurance through USATF and cautioned that they be very wary when asked to sign waivers at competitions at which they are officiating. One should take care to not inadvertently sign away their rights and invalidate their USATF coverage.
Pioneers of Women’s LDR
Still spearheading the move to gather a collection of sports memorabilia from the early days of women’s long distance running, Barb called upon the group to send her museum-worthy clothing and documentation/souvenir programs from high profile events. WLDR Executive Committee member LeeAnn Meyer displayed a race tee shirt from the first USA Team Trials - Women’s Marathon in Los Angeles – a perfect item for the growing collection. If anyone has something to donate, Barb will gladly accept it.
WLDR representative to the Associations Committee, Irene Herman, reported on the well-attended annual Associations workshop held this past summer in San Mateo, California within the Pacific Association - a location very familiar to Irene as she serves as the president of that Association. This year they went “green” by going paperless and listing needed information in the online document library. Familiar USATF figures including Mike McNees, Bill Roe, Darlene Hickman, and Scott Hollenback were presenters and shared their expertise and opinions with those attending. Irene emphasized that if your association has newly elected officers, it would be very beneficial for them to attend this annually held workshop. There is much to be learned. From fund-raising strategies, to how to best chair a meeting, to how best to include disabled athletes in your competitions, to audits and budgets……lots of information is shared. Fifty-two associations were represented at the 2011 workshop.
Mountain Ultra Trail
Donning her MUT chair hat, Nancy Hobbs, reported on these three disciplines which fall under the umbrella of LDR. She was delighted to report that although 13 championships were held during 2011, there was one weekend, September 10-11, which stands out in that our USA 100K (Netherlands) and USA Mountain Running Team (Albania) won a total of 7 medals. Details of MUT successes for the year have been available over the years at www.usmrt.com and www.usaultrarunning.com but Nancy reported that MUT has really expanded to social media and plans to incorporate more social media in their marketing plan. Look for live updates on www.twitter.com/usmrt and on www.facebook.com/usatfmut
WLDR National Championships
Championships chair, Darren De Reuck sought approval for the 2012 bid for the 20K New Haven Road race. Kimberly Keenan Kirkpatrick made a motion to accept the bid 20k. It was seconded by LeeAnn. Motion passed. For a complete list of WLDR National Championships for 2012 please check the website.
USA Distance Project
Although unable to attend, Jack Wickens sent an update via e-mail regarding the USA Distance Project which was formed in 2005 and which is committed to forging a financial, marketing, and promotional partnership to support the long-term development of USA distance runners.
New funding partners are being sought. They are well into the process now for 2012. In 2011 they received 10 applications and 6 were awarded grants. Those six training centers that were awarded grants are: Mammoth Track Club, Team USA Minnesota, Team USA Arizona, ZAP Fitness, Bay Area Track Club, and New Jersey/New York Track Club.
Julia McKinney reported that there will be a podium summit held in May 2012. She feels strongly that the athletes who attend truly reap benefits. Some questions were fielded about the date of the summit and the possibility of moving the summit to earlier in the year.
Bill McKee, WLDR representative to the Rules Committee, reported that Item 26B had been rejected by the Rules Committee. Item 26B attempted to add a new rule which would involve gender assessments involving individuals who had undergone male to female sex reassignments or may be affected by hyperandrogenism.
Bill also reported that there was a movement to expand competition rules for LDR (and Race Walking) as they pertain to select U.S. citizens. It is being proposed that U.S. citizens who are not eligible to represent the United States in international competitions be allowed to participate in any USA National Championship race/meet that is not the sole selected event for an international team. He asked for a straw poll of the group gathered. The vast majority said that they approved of the amendment. There were a few abstentions.
Bill also wanted to know how the group felt about the proposed changes for the rule describing USATF record-eligible road races. Currently, the rules on eligibility for USATF records makes a distinction between courses with a start-to-finish separation less than or greater than 30% of the race distance. If the separation exceeds 30%, official records can be accepted only when there is not a significant tailwind during the race. Eligibility for records also depends on whether the course has a net drop in elevation exceeding 1/1000 of the race distance. It cannot drop more than 1 meter per kilometer in order to be eligible for official USATF records.
The proposed change would be to increase from 30% to 50% and drop all reference to the wind. Upon posing the question to the group, the majority agreed with the proposed change, two individuals were in opposition, and a few abstained from the informal poll.
The finishing line can be no wider than 30cm. or less than 5 cm. and may be any color which satisfies.
Law & Legislation
Prior to this year’s Annual Meeting the sports committees had been asked to revisit and update their operating procedures. Nina has concluded the task of updating the operating regulations for WLDR.
She reported that still under discussion was the minimum percentage of athletes to serve on the various sports committees.
Nina made a motion to adjourn. It was seconded by Bill McKee. The meeting was adjourned at 4:02pm.

"I was in Israel when the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution was passed passed on August 7, 1964. Unlike the people at home I learned about it on the international press and was quickly convinced that it was a scam. As a result I cut my wonderful Postdoctoral Fellowship at the Weizmann Institute a year short ,got appointed to the Biophysics Faculty at SUNY Buffalo and came home for my second tour of duty in service of my country. The first was payback for my college education as a USMC officer from 1957 to 1960. When I got to Buffalo in 1965 things were unbelievable since I had been afforded the luxury of real news coverage while in Israel. The lies and rumors were the “news” and everything I had learned was either non-existent or buried in some underground sources. I was soon the leader of an umbrella anti-war/civil rights group that took in some 20 or more organizations in the area. Read on below for I learned a lot most of which has been lost, suppressed, or forgotten.
Much of it does remain available in a chronicle written by Mitchell Goodman The Movement Toward a New America: The Beginnings of a Long Revolution (A Collage) – A What? which I keep nearby almost like some religious people keep their Bible near. I was in the movement long before its death was insured by a huge influx of liberals who were going to save the country from the very people who worked hard and suffered, were beaten, imprisoned and even died to get it going. There were so many phases. The alliances with Martin Luther King were growing stronger and stronger. We really believed we would change the country. Our belief was widespread and I, for one, have never really lost that vision.
I’ll tell you what my experience of that time tells me the decline of our movement was due to. You will not like it but the history of the times we are in backs me up. This is kind of a chicken and egg issue but let’s see if we can sort it out.
I remember clearly the day we began to lose. It was not because of right wing opposition. That has grown significantly because we declined. On that particular day the New York Times ran an editorial on its front page by James Reston. The first paragraph condemned the war for the first time. The remaining paragraphs were devoted to condemning those of us who had sacrificed to build the movement while the liberals sat by and tried to make up their minds about which side they were on. They basically claimed that we were dangerous and needed to be controlled. Today you suffer the consequences of their ability to swindle people.
They brought things into “control”. They ran Gene McCarthy and convinced the young that elections were the way to go. “Clean with Gene” was the slogan. The right wing thrived on that. The real opposition to the plutocracy was crushed. Now we suffer the consequences. Now we are forced to regain the momentum we had for changing the country.
My own way of dealing with this has been a confused attempt to find anything that can get us back on track. I worked for Obama very hard in both elections knowing that it would do little to restore what we have lost. I could easily write a book about why this is so.

"Song of the day is “Girlfriend in a Coma” by The Smiths:
Tag Archives: the smiths
“Smart” by Girl in a Coma is one of the best new songs I’ve heard in a really long time.
“Smart” is the single from the band’s latest album, and it sounds like a long-lost song by The Smiths, if The Smiths were an all-girl band.
Every single component of the song works so perfectly together — the vocals, shimmering guitar chords, drum beat that is actually quite varied and complex upon close listening, and bass line that holds it all together.
Song of the day is “Please, Please, Please Let Me Get What I Want” by the Jealous Girlfriends (original by The Smiths):
Dum Dum Girls released a great cover of “There Is a Light That Never Goes Out” by The Smiths.
This song has been covered by many artists — listen to versions by Nada Surf, Death Cab for Cutie, and Pete Yorn below:

"Orage Masters Elite 8 finalists announced, vote for your favorite video
With 24 contending crews and more than 100 skiers looking to prove their shred-worthy fortitude to compete in the Orage Masters, the Elite Eight contest has officially come to a close… Or so we thought.
After hours of intense scrutiny, deliberation, and computer-generated scientific algorithms, the 24 submissions have resulted in a three-way tie. These top three crews were chosen for their skill diversity on rails, urban and park airs, their display of the wild side “Masters Vibe,” their underdog factor, creativity, and overall impression. In other words, they slay slopes, love to have a good time and have true potential to surprise and battle the best.
Without further ado, the three crews who came out on top are: Totally Trevor Crew, HoodCrew and Me Gustan Aviones… In no specific order.
Rather than searching for a three-sided coin to flip we’ve decided to divert back to our deliberation room for the weekend before we make our make a final decision on who takes the cake.
We’ve left the three top edits on the Elite Eight contest page, wiped their total “Likes” clean and are giving you one last opportunity to sway our decision. You will have until midnight, Sunday March 17 (EST) to cast your vote by hitting the “Like” button below the video for the team you deem most worthy of a shot at Masters glory.
On Monday, March 18th, we will announce the winning crew and bestow upon them the golden ticket to the Masters on April 6, 2013.
Huge props to all the crews who submitted edits. We wish we could take all of you to Sun Valley and run a full on Masters blow out… But for now, only one crew can prevail.

"Supraspinal Fatigue Is Similar in Men and Women for a Low-Force Fatiguing Contraction
Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise
Purpose: This study determined the contribution of supraspinal fatigue to the sex difference in neuromuscular fatigue for a low-intensity fatiguing contraction. Because women have greater motor responses to arousal than men, we also examined whether cortical and motor nerve stimulation, techniques used to quantify central fatigue, would alter the sex difference in muscle fatigue.
Methods: In study 1, cortical stimulation was elicited during maximal voluntary contractions (MVC) before and after a submaximal isometric contraction at 20% MVC with the elbow flexor muscles in 29 young adults (20 ± 2.6 yr, 14 men). In study 2, 10 men and 10 women (19.1 ± 2.9 yr) performed a fatiguing contraction in the presence and absence of cortical and motor nerve stimulation.
Results: Study 1: Men had a briefer time to task failure than women (P = 0.009). Voluntary activation was reduced after the fatiguing contraction (P < 0.001) similarly for men and women. Motor-evoked potential area and the EMG silent period increased similarly with fatigue for both sexes. Peak relaxation rates, however, were greater for men than women and were associated with time to task failure (P < 0.05). Force fluctuations, RPE, HR, and mean arterial pressure increased at a greater rate for men than for women during the fatiguing contraction (P < 0.05). Study 2: Time to task failure, force fluctuations, and all other physiological variables assessed were similar for the control session and stimulation session (P> 0.05) for both men and women.
Conclusions: Supraspinal fatigue was similar for men and women after the low-force fatiguing contraction, and the sex difference in muscle fatigue was associated with peripheral mechanisms. Furthermore, supraspinal fatigue can be quantified in both men and women without influencing motor performance.",en,academic
"The process of creating a monoprint or a monotype is the same, but when doing monotypes, you work on a clean and un-etched plate. When creating a monoprint, there is always a pattern or part of an image which is repeated in each print.
Monoprints and monotypes can be created by manually adding (additive method) or removing (subtractive method) ink from a plate which is then printed using a printing press. In the subtractive method you cover a surface (metal or plexi-glass plate) entirely with color (usually with etching ink or oil paint), then you remove the ink partially or wholly to expose areas of the picture being made. You can use brushes, Q-tips, fingers, rags, etc. With the additive method, you start with a clean plate and apply the ink or oil paint (sometimes even water-based inks or crayons) in various ways.
So far I have found that making a type of notan with the ink and brayer and later adding and subtracting accordingly is a nice compromise. The brayer helps me add less ink. It has been a very long time since I worked in printmaking and I have sooooooo much to learn and relearn!
I am venturing back in with the idea I will build stronger paintings later- a more distilled painting.
Here are two of Degas' inspiring monotypes. The first is only ink and the second is oil paint with pastel scumbled over. Aren't they sumptuous?",en,reference

"Torino have not given up hope of signing Fiorentina’s Alessio Cerci despite new Coach Vincenzo Montella insisting that the player would not be sold.
Cerci hasn’t always had the best relationship with Fiorentina fans, but he has received the backing of incoming boss Montella for next season – but that hasn’t deterred Torino.
The Turin club believe that despite Montella’s vow to keep the player in a purple shirt, a bid of €4m could tempt them into agreeing a transfer.
La Stampa claims that such is Torino’s desire to land Cerci, 24, that they could offer experienced striker Rolando Bianchi in exchange.
The much-travelled Bianchi, who also has experienced problems with his own fans recently, could be attractive to Fiorentina as they need a target man to compliment Stevan Jovetic in attack.
It remains to be seen whether they would be willing to lose Cerci after Montella specifically requested that he stays.",en,web
"NC woman pleads guilty in polygamist sect murders
A member of a polygamist cult is pleading guilty to her role in the North Carolina shooting deaths of a 4-year-old boy who offended the group's leader and a woman who sought to leave.
LaRhonda Renee Smith pleaded guilty Monday to second-degree murder, kidnapping, and conspiracy to commit murder in the slayings of 28-year-old Antoinetta McKoy and 4-year-old Jadon Higganbothan. Smith was sentenced to between 23 and 30 years in prison.
Prosecutors said Smith and two other women were followers of Pete Moses, who lead a group called the Black Hebrews. The adults and their children lived together in Durham and later in Teller County, Colorado.
Moses shot Jadon in the head after the boy made a gesture toward another child that Moses thought indicated Jadon was gay.

"Oak Bay basketballer goes coast to coast with Bishop's Gaiters
For basketball fans in Greater Victoria, all eyes are on the UVic Vikes final homestand this weekend.
But far, far away from UVic’s McKinnon gym, a player who once trained there is turning heads with the Bishop’s Gaiters in the CIS.
Former Oak Bay Bays guard Mukiya Post had hoped to one day wear the blue and gold for the Vikes. It wasn’t to be. But Post didn’t give up on playing in the CIS. After two hard-earned years in college, Post is in his first year of CIS basketball and made his fourth consecutive start with the Gaiters (3-9) on Saturday.
“There were times I was working hard the last few years, and I felt the results weren’t showing. There were some hard obstacles,” said Post, in a telephone call from Lennoxville, Que., last week.
“Where I’m at now, I can say, it inspires me more to work harder now, because I’m seeing what I’ve done in the past, my work has paid off.”
The 6-foot-4 shooting guard started this season watching the first eight games from the bench, in which the team won once.
His team is still last in Quebec’s five-team conference, and has a tough task ahead if they’re going to make the post-season. But the Gaiters are on a roll now, and Post is a big part of it. The team won back-to-back games for the first time last weekend.
On Friday, Post scored 13 points in the Gaiters’ 78-75 win over the first-place Concordia Stingers. It was the Gaiters’ first win at Concordia (10-2) since 2006, and it bumped the Stingers’ national ranking back to 10th in the country, four behind the Vikes. On Saturday, Post led the team with 16 points in its 72-57 win over the University of Quebec at Montreal (6-7).
What’s more, Post has the highest free-throw percentage in the CIS, making 94 per cent of his shots from the foul line (34-for-36).
It should come as no surprise the same kid who first and foremost praises his mom for her support and inspiration also wants to put his team first.
“I feel like we’re able to accomplish more,” Post said. “We’ve lost a lot of two and three point games this year. We’re only two points back of Laval (4-8). Every game from now on is a must win for us to make the playoffs.”
The road ahead only gets better for Post, a history major with two more years of CIS eligibility after this one.
It’s how Post got to this point that bears modeling for other players. By the time Post graduated from Oak Bay High in 2009, he had accepted the CIS wasn’t an option.
“Out of high school I wasn’t ready for the CIS and a lot of times I experienced disappointment with my game.”
But Post was determined and he had a plan: to play for the Champlain College Cavaliers in St. Lambert, across the river from Montreal.
“My first year I wanted to go to Champlain. I’d heard it was a good place to develop and had moved a lot of guys to the CIS.”
Post credited Oak Bay principal David Thomson in helping. Problem was, Post thought Champlain was going to be more expensive than he could afford. Instead he happily took a scholarship to study and play in B.C.’s PacWest collegiate conference with the Quest University Kermodes (Squamish).
While there, Post learned that Champlain was going to cost far less than he thought, and that they were still interested in him. He made the jump, and it paid off fast.
“Gaiters’ coach Rod Gilpin approached me after he saw me play in the (Quebec collegiate) provincials with Champlain,” Post said.
“I came for a visit to Sherbrooke and agreed.”
Back in October, the Gaiters defeated the Vikes during the House-Laughton Hoops Classic preseason tournament in Ottawa. Post scored eight points off the bench, a “surreal moment” playing against former Bays teammate Reese Pribilsky.
“During Grades 9 and 10 I watched the Vikes. (High school) summers I’d stop by and watch them scrimmage. I knew their players and looked up to their players,” Post said. “Playing against them was like, ‘I’m here playing in the CIS.’”
Mukiya’s “little” brother, Keanau, is in his first year of junior college with Southwestern Illinois, near St. Louis. At 6-foot-11, 270 lbs., Keanau, also a former Oak Bay player, is considered an NCAA prospect.

Rutee Katrea, known in Japan as Rutee Katret (ルーティ・カトレット Ruuti Katoretto?), is the heroine of Tales of Destiny who also makes an appearance in its sequel, Tales of Destiny 2. She is considered greedy, money-hungry, and always out for herself, but eventually her more noble goals and traits are made known to the party.
Working as a Lens Hunter with her partner, Mary Argent, Rutee kills monsters to acquire Lens and sell it to Oberon Corporation for Gald. When not fighting against monsters for her money, Rutee can be found combing ancient ruins for treasures to sell. Rutee is the mistress of Atwight, the Swordian of Water, who also excels at healing magic. Atwight has been with her as long as she can remember and is like a mother figure for the girl. Rutee is also the mother of the sequel's protagonist, Kyle Dunamis.
Tales of Destiny
Rutee was born 18 years before the story begins to Hugo Gilchrist, President of Oberon Corporation, and Chris Katrea. Two years after, she was followed by her younger brother, Emilio Katrea. Their family was happy until one day when her father discovered what he believed to be the Swordian, Karell Berselius. In truth, however, though its body was that of Berselius, the soul contained within was that of Kronos, King of the Aetherians.
Kronos began to warp Hugo's mind in order to complete his goal of reviving the Aetherian civilization. It was during this time that Chris gave her daughter Atwight, another Swordian in the family's possession, to protect her in her mother's absence. As Hugo's condition worsened, Chris ended up being killed. However, he did manage to bring Rutee to the town of Cresta and leave her at an orphanage. Thus, the child escaped the horrible fate that was in store for her father and brother. As she grew up, Rutee began to forget these horrible events and the loss of her family. Because she was raised in the orphanage, she began to feel sensitive towards others who were without parents. She also felt a sense of duty toward those who took her in and raised her and wanted to earn the money they needed to survive. This desire led to her becoming a Lens Hunter, Atwight at her side as her weapon.
When Rutee was 16, she came across an injured woman. The woman's name was Mary Argent, and she had completely lost her memory of her past. Mary agreed to work with Rutee and became her partner. Her excellent skills with a sword and ax were of asset to Rutee, but they also shared a sisterly relationship. At times, however, people thought Rutee was using Mary's amnesiac state for her own benefits. After some time, the Mayor of Cresta, at his wife's insistence, backed the demolition of the orphanage in favor of putting up an art museum. They used the mounting debt of the institution as an excuse to justify their actions. Rutee didnot want to see that happen or see those children on the streets, so she set out to make as much money as she could as quick as she could.
When she was 18, she was hired by a man named Walt to find an old cane hidden within an ancient ruin near Janos. Trying to free the cane from its pedestal, Rutee was caught in a trap. Mary ran off, leaving her hanging upside-down for some time. However, Mary only left to get help and brought back a young, naive country boy named Stahn Aileron. When he finally got Rutee down, she brushed him off, angry that her pride had been wounded. However, upon seeing his prowess in battle after soldiers came to check on the commotion and realizing he wielded the Swordian Dymlos, revealed shortly afterward to be the former lover of Rutee's own Atwight, she recants what she said and asks him to come along. Stahn, not one to abandon people in need and being semi-pushed by both Swordians, agrees.
After selling the old cane to Walt and cheating him out of an additional 5,000 Gald, Rutee and the others spend the night at the inn in Harmentz. However, when they wake up they are confronted by the soldiers from the previous day. They want back what was stolen and bring friends along. The team defeats them easily, but then a young man named Leon Magnus appears. He easily decimates the party and has them tied up. Then, the boy reveals he is the master of Chaltier, the Earth Swordian which was also in the possession of Rutee's family. Though she does not yet realize it, this cocky warrior is in fact her younger brother, Emilio.
Their weapons are taken and the trio is sent to Darilsheid to be locked in prison. After bickering with Stahn for a little and trying to mitigate the blame for getting tossed in jail, they are taken to see the king. It appears like they would be executed for their actions. However, Hugo speaks up and tells the king they can be used to investigate the Straylize Temple. He suggests crowning them with special tiaras, which can be used to administer an electric shock if they misbehave, and sending Leon along to watch over them. The king agrees and the team is set free and equipped with the tiaras; he does, however, warn them about the Eye of Atamoni. Rutee asks for a reward for completing the mission, to which Hugo agrees because he feels it will motivate her. Then, they are all asked to come to his mansion. At the mansion, Stahn and Rutee are reunited with their Swordians and Hugo gives them a World Map. The team then leaves for the temple.
At the temple, they learn that Lydon, a High Priest, had stolen the Eye of Atamoni. They are also joined by Philia Felice, an apprentice priestess who wishes to make up for her failure to stop the theft. She becomes the mistress of Clemente, the Swordian of Lightning, after traveling to the sunken Er'ther Army base, Radisrol. Together, they travel to Cavalese in search of where the Eye of Atamoni was brought. Failing to find any information regarding its location there, they decide to go after the Lens Pirates in Fitzgald, which are connected to Lydon Bernhardt.
There, Rutee helps a young orphan boy who is being picked on by some rich kids, showing her softer side to Stahn. She also becomes jealous when she sees Stahn flirting with Ilene Rembrandt, one of Oberon's Branch Managers. Though she does not know the reason why, she is angered by the fact that he agrees to go on a date with her, even if it is just a tour of the town. Dragging Mary along, the girls follow them around but lose the duo when they buy tickets and enter the arena. Rutee goes back to the mansion they are staying at for the night. When Batista Diego, their prisoner, escapes the next morning, she jumps to conclusions and blames Philia because they had known each other back at the temple. However, Leon quickly reveals he let Batista go so they could use the homing device on his tiara, taken from Mary to help with the interrogation, to locate Lydon. Rutee apologizes to Philia for her mistake and they all head towards the docks where they charter a ship to Aquaveil. Though they meet Lydon in Terazzi, Aquaveil's capital, he escapes to Phandaria. The team heads there immediately where they are joined with Garr Kelvin, the prince of Phandaria, who wants to reclaim his throne. They also learned that Lydon had taken Igtenos, the Swordian of Wind, which was Phandaria's royal treasure. With caution, they headed across a frozen river and make it to Heidelberg, Phandaria's capital.
At the castle, they are confronted by a guard captain who Mary seemed to recognize as Dalis Vincent. When the guards recognize Garr, they came out in full to arrest the group, but Mary refuses to leave now that she found someone she remembers from her past. Rutee, loyal to her friend, does not want to abandon Mary, leading to both her and Stahn's capture. Mary is taken upstairs, but the two of them were locked in jail where they argue a bit on whose fault their situation was. Leon eventually comes and sets the duo free, and the whole group goes upstairs to find Mary. There, they listen in and learn about her past and the fact that she and Dalis were married. However, he was under Lydon's control, and when soldiers entered, he attacked the team. This part of the game that differs whether or not the party went to Cyril, Mary's former home, before the capital. If they did, Dalis will live and Rutee begs Mary to stay and take care of him. If the party did not go to Cyril, he will die and Rutee tries to get Mary to come with them, only to be chided by Leon. Regardless of what the party does, Mary stays behind with Dalis and the team goes on to defeat Lydon and reclaim the Eye of Atamoni.
As they return to Seinegald with the stolen Eye, Stahn confronts Rutee on the deck. She explains to him why she became a Lens Hunter and that she wanted to get the money necessary to save the people she cared about. Seeing Rutee in a new light, Stahn decides to turn down his share of Hugo's reward and allow Rutee to have it all. The others had all turned it down for their own personal reasons. Rutee is shocked by this event, but even more so by the fact that he gives her all his money and Lens before returning home on the Draconis. She thanks him for helping her and for allowing her to become more honest and open with herself. Stahn says goodbye and returns home to his village, while Rutee returns to Cresta and presents the Mayor and his wife with the money. The orphanage is saved, and she returns to help take care of the children. However, because of the Eye of Atamoni's inactivation, later revealed to be because of the discs Leon had them insert into the Swordians, Atwight has become dormant and is left in storage.
Sometime after these events, Rutee is playing with the children outside. She then hears familiar voices talking about another journey and how they would regret taking Rutee along if she is happy with these children. At the same time, other familiar voices are yelling at them to bring her. Rutee runs to the gate to see Stahn and Philia arguing with Clemente and Dymlos. They prepare to leave but Rutee refuses to allow them to go without her. After yelling at the group a bit, she goes and gets Atwight out of storage. Once the four Swordian Masters are united, they all go to Darilsheid, only to find out that Leon, Hugo, the Draconis and the Eye of Atamoni have vanished. A book on Hugo's desk becomes a vital clue and they charter a ship to Libra IV, an abandoned factory.
In the factory, the team encounters Oberon Employees trying to stop them, confirming Hugo is behind the mess. They eventually discover an elevator leading underground and find Hugo and Rembrant holding Marian hostage and forcing Leon to go along with them. Hugo orders Leon to attack the team, calling him by his birth name, Emilio. Leon then admits everything had been Hugo's plan all along, and that he is fighting to save what is most important to him. When Rutee questions his heroics, Leon immediately begins to tell her the truth: she was abandoned by her father, Hugo, along with Atwight, and he is her younger brother. Rutee is crushed by these revelations, but nonetheless raises her sword against Leon to get through. However, the collapse of the cave interrupts their advance and the team must escape on the Draconis. Leon is left behind to die as the water fills the cavern.
Following their ascent to the Aethersphere, the team has to find a ""Sky Cruiser"" at Mikheil in order to get to Belcrant. There, they encounter Rembrant who was holding Marian hostage. After defeating the old man and his crazy machine, Marian asks if Emilio is alive. Rutee sadly tells her that he is dead, and Marian says she was only hired by Hugo and cared about by Emilio because she resembled the boy's late mother. Knowing what Leon thought in his last moments, Rutee angrily informs the girl that he truly cared about her and gave his life for her, and having such sorrowful thoughts would prevent him from resting in peace. When Marian is about to get into the escape pod, Rutee thanks her for taking care of her little brother up until now. She also vows revenge against Hugo for what he did to Leon. In Helraios, they are forced to face Ilene, and she commits suicide after realizing that Hugo's path was not the right one. Stahn, who liked Ilene, is crushed, and Rutee attempts to cheer him up. Though initially unsuccessful, she continues talking to him and mentions that she and he are alike: the world isn't their main concern, they fight to simply protect the people that they care about most. Stahn is comforted by her words and feels a lot better.
When they face Hugo in Belcrant, he tries to convince the team to join him, even enticing Rutee by using the fact that she is his daughter. Rutee is unconvinced because she saw what happened to Leon and knows she has to protect the people she cares about. She charges into the fray with her friends and defeats Hugo. After the fight, he reveals that he was controlled by Berselius for all these years and that he had abandoned Rutee in order to protect her so she could be free of the sword's slavery. Hugo's last request is to see Rutee's face one more time and she complies, screaming ""Father!"" as she runs over to him. After she gives him the one thing he wanted, he dies, and Rutee begins to cry over losing the last of her family. Stahn walks up to her and says that by telling her the truth, Hugo had found happiness in the end. Rutee is comforted by his words, but the scene is cut short by Kronos regaining his body and fully reviving.
Though powerless to stop him, the team nonetheless prepares to assault Dycroft one more time and gain the necessary strength to defeat Kronos in combat. The night before the final battle, Rutee asks Philia what she thinks about Stahn and wonders why everything the priestess says is so positive. Philia wonders why Rutee does not try to look at Stahn in a positive light and tells her to be honest with herself before Rutee leaves. Stahn comes in and goes to look for her. Finding Rutee in the bar reminiscing about her past, he offers to talk with her and she says the gesture is enough. Thanking the bartender, Rutee returns to her room. The next day, the team heads up to Dycroft where they encounter several puzzles that split the team apart. They need to find the four fragments of the ""Delis Emblem"" and are teleported to a jail and split apart again when they only have three. Rutee is relieved when Stahn finds her. When he gets in contact with the others via a special tile, Rutee reads him the code so he can properly solve the puzzle. After he returns, Stahn greets Rutee with a cheerful, ""Hi honey, I'm home,"" which embarrasses her.
Finally, the group makes it to the inner sanctums of Kronos's domain to find him draining the energy from the surface to revive the Aetherians. They follow the king to the chamber of the Eye of Atamoni, where he summons a zombified Leon to fight the party. Rutee is once more forced to take up her sword against her younger brother. However, he demands to be killed so he can be set free. She complies, and then they turn their wrath toward Kronos himself. After the battle, the Eye of Atamoni goes wild and debris begin raining down and ravaging the surface. The only way to save the world is to sacrifice the Swordians to destroy the Eye of Atamoni. One by one, the team tosses their Swordians into the Eye. When it comes to Rutee's turn, she refuses to say goodbye. Atwight understands how she feels and reveals the promise she made long ago to Chris Katrea, the promise she fulfilled with her death: to always protect Rutee so she might live a better life. Rutee thanks Atwight before tossing her in. A year later, the team is reunited at Stahn's place. Rutee jumps down off the roof in order to get a rise out of Stahn and begins giggling about him getting soft living out in the country. They banter playfully for a bit but soon go inside to continue the party.
Tales of Destiny 2
Sometime within a year after the reunion, Stahn moves in with Rutee, who is now the director of Dunamis Orphanage in Cresta. Three years following the final battle, the couple has a young son whom they name Kyle. Kyle looks exactly like his father and inherits his habit of sleeping in. Rutee finds the only way to wake either of her boys is to bang a ladle on a frying pan in a technique called ""waking the dead"". Because they are raising the orphans and all of them go by the last name Dunamis, the couple decide to give their son that last name as well. Kyle becomes close friends with Loni Dunamis, a boy eight years his senior, who is like an older brother to him. It seems that Rutee has finally found the happiness she was denied long ago by Kronos. By this time, the four Swordian Masters are referred to as ""The Four Heroes"".
However, when Kyle is around five, all of that changed. A mysterious stranger who would later be known as Barbatos Goetia appears at the orphanage and attacks Kyle and Loni, finally holding Loni hostage. Rutee and Stahn come out to defend the children but are told to drop their weapons if they want them to live. The man does not accept money or lens in return for leaving, all he wants is to take both of their lives. Stahn goes down first and Rutee is attacked a split second later after yelling at Loni to get Kyle out of there. Though she survives the incident, Stahn is killed. Kyle suppresses his memories of the death of his father, telling himself that Stahn simply went on a journey. Rutee is willing to let her son believe as he wants, hoping that it would be better on him.
A Mother's Prayer
When Kyle is 15, Rutee's life is still pretty much the same. She continues taking care of the children of Dunamis and trying to protect her son. Kyle is increasingly edgy, wanting to go on an adventure of his own to be a hero like his parents. After Loni, who has been working as a soldier in Atamoni, comes back with news of a gigantic Lens worth three million Gald, Kyle wants to go along with him. Rutee refuses, but the boy sneaks out to explore the Ruins of Laguna anyway. Though initially mad at him for running off and ignoring her authority, Rutee sits under the stars that night and has a talk with the sky as if she is talking to Stahn. She concludes that he is just trying to be like his parents and can see both her and Stahn inside of him. The next day, Rutee encourages Kyle to go on his journey and find what he is looking for, even giving him some traveling money to get him started.
Near the end of the game, Kyle visits his mother again seeking advice. He has just learned about how Elrane, the enemy who sent the assassin to kill Stahn, plans to revive the goddess Fortuna and bring the world under her rule. However, if Kyle kills Fortuna, it will mean the death of Reala, the girl he is in love with, because she was a daughter of Fortuna. Kyle plans on seeking the advice of each of the surviving heroes. Rutee now knows that Kyle has realized the truth behind his father's death and apologizes for keeping it from him. Somehow, she knows exactly what his problem is and tells her son to listen to what his heart is telling him: what is best for Reala, what she knows needs to be done. Now more than ever, Rutee knows that Kyle is Stahn's son and tells him as he leaves that both his parents are proud of him. The group of six head for the final showdown, never once letting on to Rutee that the masked swordsman traveling with them is in fact her brother, and he has never told anyone that Rutee is his sister.
After the defeat of Fortuna, the timeline is brought back to its true form. In this time, Elrane does not exist so she never revived Barbatos and thus Stahn never died. Rutee was allowed to be happy with her husband and son, never knowing there was a time when he was taken from her. However, when Kyle is 15 he begs to go out on a journey of his own. Though initially reluctant, Rutee eventually agrees when Stahn sides with Kyle. What she does not know is that he is about to be bringing home a girlfriend because Reala will be revived in this timeline due to Kyle's strong heart.

"It all might start to change this week.
Today and tomorrow are the days that marriage equality supporters have been waiting for, when the Supreme Court takes on the issue in two separate cases.
On Tuesday, the court will hear one hour of testimony on California’s Proposition 8 case, formally known as Hollingsworth vs Perry. On Wednesday, the justices will devote 110 minutes to hear arguments on the so-called federal Defense of Marriage Act, United States vs. Windsor.
LGBT rights supporters and detractors were lining up as early as last Thursday to be in the courtroom for the arguments.
We wondered what specific issues the justices would be looking at in the two cases, and what possible outcomes the justices may decide.
Let’s take Prop 8 first
According to Geoffrey Stone, an expert on constitutional law and former dean at the University of Chicago Law School, the court will likely make one of four decisions in hearing Prop 8 on Tuesday:
1) Not hear the case
2) Agree with the opinion of Judge Stephen Reinhardt of the Ninth Circuit, which would limit the decision only to California
3) Rule Prop 8 unconstitutional, but only in states where marriage is currently legal and states that already give LGBT people some protections – like civil unions or domestic partnerships
4) Rule Prop 8 unconstitutional in total – meaning LGBT people have a right to marry everywhere U.S. law is applicable
Stone thinks the last scenario is unlikely, given the makeup of the court and recent suggestions by liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg that the Supreme Court may have “moved too far too fast” in the 1973 Roe vs. Wade case, thus giving rise to the bitter divide over abortion that still rages 40 years later.
The second option – agreeing with the lower court’s decision – would slow down the process, by ruling Prop 8 unconstitutional only on the grounds that when a state has already legalized marriage equality, it can’t take that right away. That is the ruling the Ninth Circuit made in February of 2012 in deciding the Prop 8 case. Judge Reinhardt specifically declined to consider whether same-sex marriage is constitutional, ruling narrowly on the ability of states to take away rights it has already granted. Since California is the only state in the country that has granted LGBT couples the right to marry, then taken that right away, California only would be affected by this decision.
The second option is also more in line with a decision Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote in1996 striking down Colorado’s Amendment 2, which the court said discriminated against LGBT people and therefore violated the Equal Protection Clause.
The third option, Stone thinks, is the most likely – that states that recognize same-sex couples on some level have to recognize marriage. Some legal watchers have dubbed this the “eight state solution,” in that it would automatically legalize same-sex marriage in eight states – Illinois, Nevada, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Delaware and Hawaii – but it wouldn’t hold marriage legal in states such as Mississippi or Utah, which have constitutional amendments banning same-sex marriage.
It will now also include Colorado, which passed a civil unions law this past Thursday. Stone said that the decision to grant LGBT couples some rights in Colorado will, if the third option is adopted, trump the constitutional amendment banning marriage equality the state passed in 2006.
So, if the third option prevails, and the Court rules Prop 8 unconstitutional, but only applies it to states that have marriage laws already or states that have some same-sex couple protection, that will be 19 states, plus the District of Columbia, where same-sex couples can get married.
This is exactly the outcome that the Obama administration has argued for the in its amicus brief to the court.
“It’s an intermediate step for the courts to eventually invalidate the laws against same-sex marriage,” Stone said. “The Justices might want to go slow – even though the majority of people favor same-sex marriage, there are states in the union which would consider it an outrage.”
Of course, the court may simply decide that there is no case to be made. In both Prop 8 and DOMA, Stone pointed out, “the State of California and the Justice Department have been clear that they think those laws are unconstitutional.” That means that a government entity is not arguing against the issue at hand. In the case of Prop 8, California is not defending the state law. The justices may decide that since a government is not arguing for its own law, then the Court will not hear the case.
Marriage equality advocates don’t want that scenario, as it would allow the Ninth Circuit decision to stand – which only rules that LGBT people can get married in California.
Now let’s look at DOMA
The Justices will also decide if those that are arguing for the so-called Defense of Marriage Act have legal standing to do so, given that the Obama administration is not defending the law.
You’ll get up-to-date information on both cases here on the blog, and up-to-the-moment updates by Liking us on Facebook and Following us on Twitter!
Two lowercourts last year ruled DOMA unconstitutional, so if the justices don’t hear the case, those rulings will stand and the federal government will give the same benefits to same-sex married couples as it currently does to opposite sex married couples.
There’s also the possibility that the Court will rule that DOMA is constitutional.
“I think that’s highly unlikely,” said Stone. “I don’t think there’s any scenario in which Anthony Kennedy would do that.”
Stone believes that Kennedy wants to write these opinions affirming some constitutionality of marriage equality. And he believes that Kennedy wants to write the next opinion – in a few years – legalizing same-sex marriage for all states.
DOMA, he thinks, will be struck down, both because “Kennedy will be skeptical of denial of same-sex marriage” and because of the issue of whether the Federal government has any business telling people who they can marry. That, Stone asserted, could possibly be the issue that draws Chief Justice John Roberts to vote for striking DOMA down as well.
If DOMA is struck down, it will mean that LGBT couples will be afforded the approximately 1,100 federal benefits that opposite sex couples already get. It will not mean that states that don’t honor marriage equality will have to recognize same-sex marriages performed in other states. That’s an issue pertaining to the Full Faith and Credit clause of the constitution, which deals with contract law.",en,web

At Saint Viator we believe that an essential component of the Gospel, the teachings of the Catholic Church and the Viatorian tradition, is the call of Christians to serve those in need, with special concern for the poor. For this reason, we provide our students the opportunity to live their faith through the experience of service to others. Our college preparatory curriculum, based in Catholic values, empowers students to become lifelong learners making sound choices in a changing world.
Recognizing that we live in an ever-changing society, Saint Viator High School students, as they acquire a foundation in each academic discipline, will:
- Respond to the challenge of the Gospel through commitment to service.
- Know the foundations of the Catholic faith.
- Develop spiritual, emotional and physical wellness.
- Recognize the dignity of each person and appreciate the diversity among people.
- Be aware of global events and respond with concern.
- Make effective life choices.
- Communicate effectively.
- Access and evaluate information creatively.
- Be aware of technological developments and their uses.",en,reference
"In a press release posted online this week (http://www.arl.org/sparc/media/12-0117.shtml), SPARC (Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition), lauded Michael Nielsen’s work “for bringing Open Science into the mainstream,” and added him to a prestigious list of SPARC Innovators.
The timing for this announcement couldn’t be better as the ScienceOnline conference is set to get underway tomorrow and Michael was featured in a New York Times article by Thomas Lin yesterday.
SPARC cites Michael’s popularization of Open Science–in particular his hefty tour schedule of 2011 and his book Reinventing Discovery–in their announcement. They also have a wonderful profile with comments from SPARC Executive Director Heather Joseph, Melissa Hagemann from the Open Society Foundations, biochemist Cameron Neylon, and John Dupuis, the head of the Steacie Science and Engineering Library at York University (the blogger behind Confessions of a Science Librarian).

"The Swiss Psychologist and former Freud disciple Carl Gustav Jung was interested in the teachings of alchemy and astrology, especially in the later phases of his working life. The resulting insights can be found in his Analytical Psychology. This theory goes far beyond the teachings of Freud.
Freud assumes that a child is born as a ""tabula rasa"", and the character begins to form from birth onwards. Jung, on the contrary, states in his book Psychological Types: The individual disposition is already a factor in childhood; it is innate, and not acquired in the course of life.
The whole theory of astrology is based on this principle. Liz Greene, a Jungian psychotherapist and astrologer, is convinced that astrology can help to discover the nature of this innate seed. Astrology can not only tell us about the self we know, but also about the one we do not know, she writes in Relating. The horoscope, being a ""map of the psyche"", can point to character traits which have not yet become conscious. With its help we may get to know ourselves better and come to a more complete understanding of our true nature. Jung's Analytical Psychology attempts something very similar: individuation and arrival at one's true self.
Some of the Jungian principles reflected in astrology will be described on the following pages. We will look at the concepts of ""Synchronicity"", ""Archetypes"", and the ""Psychological Types"".",en,books
"USGA pulls out of Colorado GC for 2012
The U.S. Golf Association has withdrawn an initial plan for Colorado Golf Club to co-host the 2012 U.S. Amateur.
The private club, designed by Bill Coore and Ben Crenshaw and opened in 2007 in Parker, Colo., southeast of Denver, was home to the 2010 Senior PGA Championship and is scheduled to host the 2013 Solheim Cup.
Plans called for the layout to share the stroke-play qualifying duties for the 2012 Amateur with Cherry Hills Country Club, site of the subsequent match-play competition for the 64 qualifiers. Instead, Cherry Hills will co-host stroke play with CommonGround Golf Course, a Tom Doak-designed layout just east of downtown Denver. The par-71 layout, 7,250 yards from the back tees, is owned and operated by the Colorado Golf Association and is run as a daily-fee facility.
Colorado Golf Club, rated No. 37 on the Golfweek’s Best Modern list, has been plagued by financial issues. Club founder Mike McGetrick, who resigned last year as director of golf but who has retained his ownership status, says he’s “21 days away from selling the club to a group of members,” with the sales and purchase agreement under negotiation. Of the club’s 170 home lots, 135 have been sold to individual members, McGetrick said. The remaining 35 lots are under contract to be purchased by Arendale Holdings.
While regretting loss of the stroke-play share of he 2012 U.S. Amateur, McGetrick said he understands the USGA “did the right thing for themselves and for the championship. There were just too many financial uncertainties.”",en,web

"What an innovative idea Entertainment Tonight has come up with, dressing The Real Housewives Of New Jersey‘s Melissa Gorga in a morbidly obese suit (that ain’t a fat suit. ‘Tis way too big to be a fat suit). Goodness me, no one’s EVER thought to disguise themselves in fat makeup and sweats to see what kind of a reaction they get from the public. No one except Tyra Banks and Vanessa Minnillo to name a few.
Gorga walked through New York’s Times Square today (October 24th) wearing a pink sweat suit over another kind of suit and glasses to disguise herself.
Yawn…been there, done that, ET. We get it. People are cruel to and gawk at those with extra pounds to spare. We can only imagine Gorga interview will play out a little something like this: “Oh my gosh, I couldn’t believe the reaction from people on the streets. I was like ‘Is this really happening? Is this how those poor people are treated?’ Thank you Jesus *Looks up to the sky and blesses herself* I have the body I have with the help of (insert fat burning supplement she’s likely endorsing).”",en,web

"Ever wondered what white tea is? Why we call it white anyway? Here are a few interesting facts about white tea, made from the plant Camellia sinensis:
- White tea is similar to green tea in that it has undergone little processing and no fermentation whatsoever.
- The leaves are harvested before they open fully, when the unopened buds are still covered by thin silvery white hair. Hence the white tea name.
- White tea has a subtle and slightly sweet flavor that sharpens the senses without overwhelming the tongue, whereas green tea has a “grassy” taste.
- There is 25% to 30% less caffeine in white tea than in green tea, though it depends on the variety.
- White tea health benefits are the highest among the tea family¹.
- It is more expensive than green or black tea because white tea is scarcer. Yet, at Savorique, white tea is as cheap as black or green tea.

"In Scouting, knives are a double-edged sword.
Used safely, they’re part of a rite of passage for boys and a chance for leaders to impart important lessons to help Scouts become “Prepared. For Life.”
But inevitably, some Scout will do his best Crocodile Dundee impression and show up at summer camp with the 10-inch sheath knife his uncle bought him.
The BSA keeps its knife policy intentionally vague (see below), offering suggestions but leaving specific policies up to individual units.
Does your pack, troop, team, or crew have a policy?
Units with knife policies often set a specific maximum blade length and other restrictions. Others leave it up to their Scouts’ common sense and only intervene if the need arises — such as confiscating a Scout’s big sheath knife or butterfly-style knife and returning it to his parents after the trip.
Whether you have a policy or are considering creating one, first read what the Guide to Safe Scouting says:
A sharp pocketknife with a can opener on it is an invaluable backcountry tool. Keep it clean, sharp, and handy. Avoid large sheath knives. They are heavy and awkward to carry, and unnecessary for most camp chores except for cleaning fish. Since its inception, Boy Scouting has relied heavily on an outdoor program to achieve its objectives.
This program meets more of the purposes of Scouting than any other single feature. We believe we have a duty to instill in our members, youth and adult, the knowledge of how to use, handle, and store legally owned knives with the highest concern for safety and responsibility.
Remember—knives are not allowed on school premises, nor can they be taken aboard commercial aircraft.
The Guide to Safe Scouting doesn’t get more specific than that, but most states do. Some states restrict knife length — in Texas, for example, a knife with a blade longer than 5.5 inches is deemed “illegal.” Others forbid certain kinds of knives, such as throwing knives.
This site aggregates state knife laws, so check your state’s laws today and be in the know.
How to create a policy
In keeping with the youth-led spirit of Boy Scout troops, Venturing crews, and Varsity teams, you’re better off letting the Scouts set their own policy.
Involving them in the process ensures that they’ll take ownership in the policy and will more effectively follow and enforce it.
Suggest they address knife length, kinds of knives allowed, how many knives each Scout can bring, proper storage, Totin’ Chip requirements, and anything else that addresses specific needs in your unit. And don’t forget to print out your state’s knife laws and give that to your youth leaders to consult.
Pretty soon, you’ll have a policy that allows — encourages, even — the safe use of knives in Scouting.
Take the poll
Need your own knife? Win one!
Speaking of knives, don’t forget to enter the CUT ABOVE GIVEAWAY for a chance to take home one of six great knives. Contest ends Aug. 31, 2012.
What do you think?
I’d love to know whether packs, troops, teams, and crews have specific knife policies. If so, what do they include? Do you specify a maximum blade length? What about quantity — can Scouts carry multiple knives? Leave your thoughts below.

"Interview: Robert Osborne on the 2012 TCM classic film fest and last year's 'disappointing' Oscar season
The Turner Classics host is primed for a third year of classic cinema in Hollywood
Before Turner Classic Movies embarked on a Hollywood-set film festival aimed at presenting classic films on the big screen in 2010, film historian and TCM Prime Time host Robert Osborne tried his hand at a similar program on the east coast. He happily lent his name to the Robert Osborne Classic Film Festival in Athens, Georgia, a partnership with the University of Georgia, for six years before the economy forced the program to be shuttered.
""It told me kind of how audiences would respond to certain things, and how to present them,"" he says, calling from the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel, ground zero for this year's third annual TCM fest. ""And we started out with enthusiastic audiences and to full houses. So it really showed me that there was an audience out there that would have a great time when word-of-mouth got around. More than anything it kind of convinced me that it was not something that just because people could see these movies for free at home that they wouldn't be really excited about coming from all over the world to see classic films on a big screen in Hollywood.""
Nevertheless, it took marquee title films early on to achieve the attendance levels Osborne and TCM were hoping for. ""Casablanca"" and ""Singin' in the Rain"" (both films reprising this year for their 70th and 60th respective anniversaries) were the big attractions, he says. But there were also nuggets for cineastes, like a newly restored version of Fritz Lang's silent masterwork ""Metropolis"" and an anniversary screening of Jean-Luc Godard's ""Breathless.""
This year, Osborne says, before the announcement of the program's film schedule and celebrity appearances, premium passes were sold out within two hours of tickets going on sale. ""It means that people were trusting us and the films we would pick would be good ones,"" he says. ""They didn't have to wait to be told what the films were going to be to decide to buy a ticket. And I think that's the biggest thing; the trust factor got there. And that turned out to be great because then it means they don't have to book for marquee names; you can book really terrific films that maybe people don't know by name but they're going to realize that they're going to see something they would probably like and see something that might be a great discovery and they go for it.""
This year's festival features a slew of special presentations and restoration screenings to tickle the film-lover's fancy. Of course Osborne finds it tough to pick just one ""must-see"" from the cornucopia of titles, but he also notes that it's very much an individual thing.
TCM's third annual classic film fest is almost ready for its close-up
A grab bag of classic cinema and a wealth of restoration screenings mark the ...
- Check out everything there is including photos, reviews, videos.
""For me, one of the must-sees would be 'Cover Girl,' with Rita Hayworth and Gene Kelly on a big screen, with Stanley Donen doing some of the choreography and stuff. Another must-see for me would be 'Funny Face,' again, Stanley Donen, because that's such a visual movie and it's Fred Astaire and it's Paris and it's Audrey Hepburn and the great Gershwin music score and to see the magic of it on the big screen. But also I would say a must-see is 'How the West was Won,' to be able to see it in Cinerama, which it hasn't been shown in Cinerama on a regular basis for years.""
And he can't stop there. ""The Thief of Baghdad"" with Douglas Fairbanks, Sr., springs to mind, as, of course, does today's big opening night presentation, ""Cabaret,"" with Oscar-winning stars Liza Minnelli and Joel Grey in attendance. ""You're playing 'Cabaret' on a big screen at the Chinese Theatre, I mean, that's like irresistible to me,"" Osborne says. ""Somebody I talked to recently said the one more than anything else they want to see is 'Seconds,' the John Frankenheimer film. Somebody else said, 'Well, I want to see 'The Longest Day' because it's going to be in Cinemascope on a big screen, never seen it that way and it's such an awesome film.' So it's kind of to each his own. But the great thing is we've got films from all the eras and we've got films from all the genres. If you like war films, fine. If you like musicals, great. If you like adventure films, we've got '20,000 Leagues Under the Sea' and we've got, you know, Randolph Scott westerns, the whole mix. I think that's very important.""
One showcase in particular is a bit of an unofficial centerpiece for the fest when you look out over the schedule: Saturday night's screening of Roy Ward Baker's ""A Night to Remember."" The date, April 14, is both the 18th birthday of Turner Classic Movies and the eve of the 100th anniversary of the sinking of the Titanic. The latter event has been quite the talk of the film world given the recent 3D conversion of James Cameron's 1997 film, but here's a chance for film-goers to discover a dramatization that came 40 years before that Leonardo DiCaprio/Kate Winslet romance came along and destroyed all box office records.
""So many people don't know that movie,"" Osborne says. ""They only know the 'Titanic' of James Cameron or the 'Titanic' of Fox with Clifton Webb and Barbara Stanwyck and Bob Wagner. The British 'A Night to Remember' is so beautifully done and so well-constructed. So it's a logical fit for our festival because it's not just a piece of Hollywood showmanship or Hollywood glamor but it's a really well-crafted British film.""
A quick conversation with Robert Osborne can't pass without some idle commentary on the recent Oscar season. After all, the author of ""80 Years of the Oscar: The Official History of the Academy Awards"" might have a thing or two to say about a season thematically dominated by reverence for the cinema, and particularly classic cinema, at that.
""I loved the way it turned out, but I didn't think it was a very good season,"" he says. ""I didn't think, to me, that there was really -- except for 'A Separation,' which I thought was great -- I didn't think there was a really great film out there this year. I did love 'The Artist.' I've seen it four times and every time I see it, it gets better and better. I think it's really a great film and I think he's [Best Actor winner Jean Dujardin] terrific in it. And it's wonderfully directed and very clever, and it's so well-researched, too.
""I thought 'The Iron Lady,' that she [Meryl Streep] was fabulous, but I didn't think the film was as good as I wanted it to be. But I thought she deserved to win. I liked 'The Help' and I love Viola Davis. But I didn't think that film was a great film; I thought that was a very uneven film. I thought the Southern women were so caricatured that it was kind of like 'Harper Valley PTA' or something like that. Overall I was kind of disappointed this year in films.""
But there's no better antidote to a disappointing awards season than a four-day rush through the best classic cinema has to offer, and that's what Osborne and TCM will be busying themselves with beginning tonight with the opening night screening of ""Cabaret."" The fest runs through Sunday, April 15. Check out the official TCM Classic Film Festival website for schedules and details.

"Lewis Fry Richardson, FRS (11 October 1881 - 30 September 1953) was a mathematician, physicist, meteorologist, psychologist and pacifist who pioneered modern mathematical techniques of weather forecasting, and the application of similar techniques to studying the causes of wars and how to prevent them. He is also noted for his pioneering work on fractals.
At age 12 he was sent to a Quaker boarding school, Bootham in York, where he received an excellent education in science, which stimulated an active interest in natural history. In 1898 he went on to Durham College of Science (now Newcastle University) where he took courses in mathematical physics, chemistry, botany, and zoology. Two years later, he gained a scholarship to King's College, Cambridge, where he graduated with first-class honours in the natural sciences tripos in 1903.
In 1909 he married Dorothy Garnett (1885–1956), daughter of the mathematician and physicist William Garnett. They were unable to have children due to an incompatibility in blood types, but they adopted two sons and a daughter between 1920 and 1927.
In 1926, he was elected to the Fellowship of the Royal Society
“After so much hard reasoning, may one play with a fantasy? Imagine a large hall like a theatre, except that the circles and galleries go right round through the space usually occupied by the stage. The walls of this chamber are painted to form a map of the globe. The ceiling represents the north polar regions, England is in the gallery, the tropics in the upper circle, Australia on the dress circle and the Antarctic in the pit.
A myriad computers are at work upon the weather of the part of the map where each sits, but each computer attends only to one equation or part of an equation. The work of each region is coordinated by an official of higher rank. Numerous little ""night signs"" display the instantaneous values so that neighbouring computers can read them. Each number is thus displayed in three adjacent zones so as to maintain communication to the North and South on the map.
From the floor of the pit a tall pillar rises to half the height of the hall. It carries a large pulpit on its top. In this sits the man in charge of the whole theatre; he is surrounded by several assistants and messengers. One of his duties is to maintain a uniform speed of progress in all parts of the globe. In this respect he is like the conductor of an orchestra in which the instruments are slide-rules and calculating machines. But instead of waving a baton he turns a beam of rosy light upon any region that is running ahead of the rest, and a beam of blue light upon those who are behindhand.
Four senior clerks in the central pulpit are collecting the future weather as fast as it is being computed, and despatching it by pneumatic carrier to a quiet room. There it will be coded and telephoned to the radio transmitting station. Messengers carry piles of used computing forms down to a storehouse in the cellar.
In a neighbouring building there is a research department, where they invent improvements. But these is much experimenting on a small scale before any change is made in the complex routine of the computing theatre. In a basement an enthusiast is observing eddies in the liquid lining of a huge spinning bowl, but so far the arithmetic proves the better way. In another building are all the usual financial, correspondence and administrative offices. Outside are playing fields, houses, mountains and lakes, for it was thought that those who compute the weather should breathe of it freely.” (Richardson 1922)
(Note that the word computers is used here in its original sense - people who did computations, not machines. Calculator also referred to people at this time.)
He was also interested in atmospheric turbulence and performed many terrestrial experiments. The Richardson number, a dimensionless parameter in the theory of turbulence is named after him. He famously summarised the field in rhyming verse in Weather Prediction by Numerical Process (p 66):
Big whirls have little whirls that feed on their velocity,[A play on Jonathan Swift's ""Great fleas have little fleas upon their backs to bite 'em, And little fleas have lesser fleas, and so ad infinitum."" (1733)].
- and little whirls have lesser whirls and so on to viscosity.
He also originated the theory that the propensity for war between two nations was a function of the length of their common border. And in Arms and Insecurity (1949), and Statistics of Deadly Quarrels (1950), he sought to statistically analyze the causes of war. Factors he assessed included economics, language, and religion. In the preface of the latter, he wrote: ""There is in the world a great deal of brilliant, witty political discussion which leads to no settled convictions. My aim has been different: namely to examine a few notions by quantitative techniques in the hope of reaching a reliable answer.""
As part of his research, Richardson investigated how the measured length of a border changes as the unit of measurement is changed. He published empirical statistics which led to a conjectured relationship. This research was quoted by mathematician Benoît Mandelbrot in his 1967 paper How Long Is the Coast of Britain?
Suppose the coast of Britain is measured using a 200 km ruler, specifying that both ends of the ruler must touch the coast. Now cut the ruler in half and repeat the measurement, then repeat again:
Notice that the smaller the ruler, the bigger the result. It might be supposed that these values would converge to a finite number representing the ""true"" length of the coastline. However, Richardson demonstrated that the measured length of coastlines and other natural features appears to increase without limit as the unit of measurement is made smaller. Today this is known as the Richardson effect.
At the time, Richardson's research was ignored by the scientific community. Today, it is seen as one element in the birth of the modern study of fractals.

"Forecastle Festival starts tonight, and Team ENS is getting pretty psyched. Fearless Leader Joe, Keith and I will be down there all three days to tweet, take photos and sweat through at least 6 t-shirts a piece. Blazing heat aside, I’m looking forward to my first trip to Forecastle for what promises to be an amazing lineup. I mean, seriously – Flaming Lips? Devo? Spoon? Cake? It’s an endless list of awesome, and ENS will be there for all of it. Here’s a preview of some of the bands I’m anticipating at 2010’s Forecastle Festival.
Day 1: Friday, June 9
After driving a couple hours after 8 hours at work and then setting up a tent, I can’t think of a better way to start off the night than with Dead Confederate. The psychedelic rock band from Athens, Georgia will be touring with Deer Tick later this summer.
8:40pm – 9:20pm at East Stage
Margot and the Nuclear So and So’s
Indianapolis’ Margot and the Nuclear So and So’s have been a favorite of mine since 2006’s Dust of Retreat. It’s been a while since I’ve seen the 8-piece indie collective, so it will be a welcome start to the festival.
9:40pm – 10:20pm at East Stage
I’m not a huge fan of jam bands but come on, what’s a summer music festival without a jam band? It’s a Friday night – what better way to unwind before the chaos that will ensue on Saturday?
9:45pm – 12:15am at West Stage
DAY 2: Saturday, June 10
I don’t know anything about this Lexington DJ, but who cares? They’re called Booty Sweat, and they have a song on their Myspace called “Pussy Hound.” Win.
2:40 – 3:30 on Ocean Stage
Add this to the list of “leap of blog buzz faith” bands I’ll be checking out. I haven’t heard anything by Lexington psych group Wax Fang but what kind of music blogger would I be if I didn’t check out bands based solely on hype?
3:50 – 4:20 on East Stage
Grace Potter & The Nocturnals
Grace Potter is the newest addition to the indie’s retro rock resurgence, and she seems to be fitting in pretty well. Potter holds her own as a soulful blues rock, taking notes from singers like Tina Turner and Stevie Nicks.
4:15pm – 5:15pm at West State
—Follow the ENS crew on twitter during Forecastle @eachnotesecure & @cutelin
It’s been six years since the release of Pressure Chief, so Cake has been kind of off my radar, but I was pleasantly surprised to see them on Forecastle’s lineup. The band has been busy touring this summer, and recently finished their new album, which will be released later this year on their label, Upbeat Records.
Saturday @ 5:40 – 7:00 on West Stage
Do I have to explain why I want to see DEVO? I mean, it’s DEVO. The band recently released a new album, Something For Everybody so…I guess there’s that. Fun fact: every Thursday Jerry answers questions from fans who call in from the website.
7:30pm – 8:45pm at West Stage
Why does Cap ‘n Jazz have to play at the same time as Smashing Pumpkins?! After much debating, I’m going with Cap ‘n Jazz. I feel guilty because Smashing Pumpkins is like, one of the biggest rock bands ever, but come on. The short-lived but highly influential emo band is reuniting for a minute to celebrate the rerelease of the epic 34-track anthology, Analphabetapolothology on vinyl. They released just one full-length album before its members went their separate ways to form a handful of bands – most notably, Make Believe, The Promise Ring, American Football, Owls, Ghosts and Vodka, Joan of Arc and Owen.
10:30pm – 12:00am at East Stage
Day 3: Sunday, June 11
Minus the Bear
Looks like I’m camping out at the West Stage all Sunday, starting with a set from Minus the Bear. I haven’t followed MTB’s last couple of albums too closely, but the prog pop group provided my summer soundtrack before I went to college. Every time I hear Highly Refined Pirates I can’t help but feel the warm fuzzies of nostalgia.
5:30pm – 6:30pm at West Stage
She & Him
Like many before me, I have succumbed to the power of Zooey Deschanel’s cuteness. Yeah, Volume I put me to sleep and Volume II got maybe two listens from me, max. Still, how can I complain when Zooey’s onstage being her cute, quirky self and M. Ward is being…well, the man? It’s fluff, but it’s fluff in cute packaging and I’m alright with that.
7:00 – 8:15 at West Stage
Spoon is pretty busy these days. Between touring in support of their latest album Transference (including a stop at Madison Theater in Covington!), they performed on Jimmy Kimmel and Letterman. They’re also playing a handful of gigs with some band named Arcade Fire, and making stops at Austin City Limits and Matador’s 21st birthday party in Las Vegas.
8:45 – 10:00 at West Stage
The Flaming Lips
Ask anyone about a Flaming Lips show and the response will usually involve a combination of the following phrases: “Wayne Coyne in a bubble”, “confetti cannons”, “dancing aliens” and/or “I don’t know man, I was really high.” The Flaming Lips put on one of the most elaborate, spacey concerts of any band I’ve ever seen, and though I’ve seen them twice already, I’ll probably be camped out on Sunday at the front of the stage so Wayne Coyne can walk over me in a giant hamster ball.

"Imaginative choices make all the difference
by SEAN CONWAY photography by WEBB CHAPPELL
WHEN YOU ENTER A ROOM that is empty except for a single chair, that chair demands to be noticed. To achieve the same effect with a container planting, you need to be able to define what it is that catches your eye and separates it from just another plant or group of plants in a pot.
There are two basic components to a container planting: the plants and the container. The strongest visual impact conies about when these two components complement each other, or are combined in a way that generates greater visual interest than either would possess separately.
CHOOSE CONTAINERS WITH CHARACTER
A container can be anything that will hold either soil or water without creating a potentially toxic environment for the plants it will hold. Often, it is the unexpected objects that make the most interesting containers. Several years ago, for instance, while I was cleaning out my barn, I discovered an old, rusty iron pig-feeding trough. It had a wonderfully long, low, horizontal shape, but absolutely no drainage.
I didn’t want to ruin the trough’s character by riddling it with drainage holes. The solution lay in choosing plants to grow in it that wouldn’t require drainage, in this case Oryza sativa ‘Red Dragon’, commonly known as red-leaved rice. This Asian native, which I grow as an annual in my USDA Zone 6b garden and nursery, is perfectly suited to shallow water of four to six inches or less. Its narrow, arched, red leaves were also a perfect complement to the rusted color of the container.
For a finishing touch, I covered the surface of the soil with green river-bottom stones, which I purchased from a well-stocked garden shop. By filling the trough with just enough water to cover the stones, I was able to emphasize the water as another element that distinguished the trough planting from just another potted plant.
This brings up a valuable point: containers that hold water offer a welcome break from the expected. Thanks to the popularity of water gardening, there is a rich and ever-expanding palette of aquatic plants from which to choose. Another of my container water plantings—a marble font purchased from an antique shop—has become an attractive home to corkscrew rush (Juncus effusus f. spiralis) and floating azolla (Azolla filiculoides), a fast-growing aquatic fern. With its leafless, spiraling stems that grow from 18 to 24 inches long, the corkscrew rush is hard to miss. The azolla, which ranges in color from soft green to greenish red, depending on how much sun it receives, so completely covers the surface of the water that it looks like emerald-green moss. This container has a wonderful tactile dimension as well—visitors who touch the azolla are delighted to find that it jiggles like a water bed.
Favorite Water Plants for Containers
A floating water fern that lays flat on the surface of water-the perfect surface covering for still water in any container. Pairs of tiny, delicate fronds are supported by single strands of fine roots. Ranges from emerald green in the shade to deep burgundy in full sun. Zones 7-10.
Distinctive container plantings can be as much about situatingj the cqntain-ers as planting them; on a stone wail, against a green background, this red-leaved rice (Oryza sativa ‘Red Dragon’) is impossible to miss. Previous page/left: A marble font makesan irrev-erent, watery home for corkscrew rush (Juncus ef-fusus f. spiralis) and spongy Azolla liliculoides, Right: Coppery Libertia peregrinans, displayed at its best in a tail terra-cotta pot.
Upright, rushlike, and dark green, with beautiful, brown, bractlike coverings at each node. An excellent accent plant. Plant in a clay pot, submerging the bottom of the pot in three to four inches of water, so that it will wick up moisture. Height: 2 to 3 feet. Width: 2 to 3 feet. Zones 9-10.
COLOCASIA ‘BLACK MAGIC
The spectacular, black-leaved elephant-ear leaves are a dark, dusky purple with reddish stems. Plant in a container where it can wick up moisture; try placing the bottom of the container in three to four inches of water. Height: 36 to 48 inches. Width: will quickly fill large containers, Zones 7b-10.
The white-banded, red-veined pitcher plant. Best planted in containers without drainage, in live sphagnum peat moss or sand. Maintain water level two to three inches below the crown of the plant, Needs full sun and a winter dormancy period. Height 24 to 30 inches. Zones 7-9.
This dwarf golden larch (Pseudolarix amabilis ‘Annesleyana’) is undcrplant-ed with golden Sagina subulata; both are an intense lemon yellow in the spring.
Favorite Woody Plants for Containers
Most upright and weeping forms do well in containers, provided they aren’t allowed to dry out. Atrolineare’, the willow-leaved maple, has long, narrow leaves that will add an interesting texture to any container. Height: 15 to 25 feet. Zones 5/6-8.
BETULA CRIMSON FROST’
A beautiful, purple-leaved birch that holds its color throughout the season. Use as a specimen tree, or as an anchor for other pots. Plant in the ground after one season. Height: 45 feet. Width: 35 feet (in 15 years.) Zones 4-7.
CHAMAECYPARIS OBTUSA ‘NANA’
DWARF HINOKI FALSE CYPRESS
Beautiful, full, dark green foliage is excellent for brightening up a winter entryway. Plant in frost-resistant pots if you plan on leaving them outside for the winter, and water when winter temperatures are above freezing. Height: 3 feet. Width: 3 feet Zones 5-8.
CORNUS STOLONIFERA ‘SILVER AND GOLD’
A variegated form of the yellow-twig dogwood, with creamy, irregular margins around its leaf borders. This full, leafy shrub will adapt well to a container for one season. Height 7 to 9 feet. Zones 2-7
COTINUS COGGYGRIA VELVET CLOAK’
PURPLE SMOKE BUSH
Use in mixed plantings or as a specimen. For best dark purple leaf color, plant in full sun. Height: 10 to 15 feet. Width 10 to 15 feet (less when kept in a container). Zones 4-8.
MALUS CANARY’ OR ‘FIREBURST’
FLOWERING CRAB APPLE
Look for varieties that stay small and offer resistance to fire blight and rust. ‘Canary’ has tiny yellow fruits, and ‘Fireburst’ has showy, quarter-inch, bright red fruits. Height: 15-25 feet. Zones 4-7.
MATCH PLANTS WITH THE CONTAINER’S FORM AND COLOR
When you’re deciding what to plant in a container, start with the container’s form. A long narrow container, for instance, is best paired with narrow-leaved plants that will emphasize the container’s shape. Conversely, low, squat, bowl-shaped containers work best with plants of similar shapes, so that the container will accentuate the roundness of a plant, or emphasize a certain feature, such as horizontal branching. This is certainly the case with dwarf golden larch (Pseudolarix amabilis ‘Annesleyana’; Zones 4-7). Under-planting the larch with golden pearlwort (Sagina subulata ‘Aurea’) also helps to emphasize the yellow color of the larch’s spring leaves. Container shape alone, however, shouldn’t be your only consideration. When a container is extremely large, the issue of what to plant in it can become clouded. In the case of large, bowl-shaped urns, for example, you sometimes need strong, tall vertical plants in order for the scale of the planter to feel right. If the shape calls out for low, mounding plants, but the size of the container calls for ones with pronounced verticality, what should you do? In this case, the best solution is to use both types of plants. Place the vertical plants in the center for the needed height, and the low, mounding plants along the edge to complement the planter.
Container color, too, is important in determining the overall effect. The color of the container can either contrast with the plants or match them. In either case, if the container color is to play an important role in the final composition, take care to choose plants that don’t obscure the container, either immediately after you plant it or after the plants have grown in. (This is especially important if you have selected a container for color or its decorative motif.) On the other hand, if softening the look of the container or its edges is what’s needed, incorporating trailing plants or vines into the planting will accomplish this. By the time the trailing plants have grown down over the sides of the pot, the container will be visible only through a veil of stems and flowers.
LOOK FOR EXCITING PLANT CHOICES
When it comes to choosing plants for container gardening, don’t limit yourself to the plants in four-inch pots or six-packs of annuals at your local garden center. Think of it this way: if a plant is growing in a container at a nursery or garden center—whether it’s a tree, shrub, perennial, or annual—you should be able to grow it in a container on your patio, at least for a period of time.
I have found that I can comfortably use trees and shrubs bought in containers as large as 15 or even 20 gallons. (Remember: the larger the container, the heavier it is, and the heavier the container, the greater the need for a back brace!) Placed as single specimens in large pots, trees and shrubs make wonderful anchors for groupings of potted plants. I have successfully grown trees and shrubs such as birches, crab apples, smoke bushes, Japanese maples, chamaecy-paris, yews, and shrubby dogwoods this way. I have one weeping Japanese maple (Acer palmatum ‘Filigree’), for instance, that has been in the same container for years, needing only occasional root pruning. Most trees and shrubs, however, do not like to be container-bound for too many years. For these, it’s best to display them in containers for one growing season and then move them into the garden at the season’s end.
Potted trees and shrubs aren’t the only way to make a bold statement. Smaller plants can be equally dramatic, providing they have eye-catching features. The striking, swordlike foliage of Libertia peregrinans, an upright-growing plant from New Zealand popular on the West Coast, grows to only 14 inches tall and is well suited for container culture. While it would be lost among its neighbors in a mixed planting, it shines when planted alone in a cylindrical pot. Its coppery orange leaves also blend beautifully with the warm tones of terra-cotta.
Most container gardeners look for flowers to create a bold effect. Why not give foliage a try instead? Relying on foliage instead of flowers makes sense from several standpoints. To begin with, lush foliage makes a newly planted container look full and finished immediately. In contrast, plants that depend on flowers for their looks will need several weeks of growth before they start to look like anything. Having to depend on a floral display also means that when flowering plants are taking a rest, because of adverse conditions like too much rain or high temperatures, your containers won’t look like much. Interesting foliage, on the other hand, will allow you to bridge those gaps.
If I use flowering plants in containers, I tend to use them as accents. As a rule of thumb, I plant two-thirds of a mixed container with foliage plants and one-third with flowering plants. This ensures that there will always be something interesting to look at.
The key to creating eye-catching containers is figuring out how to make them interesting. Whether you’re using containers with bold color or shape or plants with interesting foliage, keep in mind that the combination of the two is what will set your container apart. If your finished product is as eye-catching as that chair in the middle of an empty room, you’ll know you’re on the right track.
When planting a container, start with something interesting, like this painted antique sap bucket (1).
Then, assemble the plants, selecting a variety of complementary shapes, leaf forms, habits, and colors (2).
After filling the container with potting soil, you can begin to plant. For a round container, it’s best to position the center plant first, in this case a spiky Elymus glaucus. Then, working outward, add foliage plants, such as ‘Swinging Linda’ coleus and trailing Dichondra argentea. Finally, backfill with flowering plants like pink Petunia integnfolia, aiming for a balanced arrangement with a final ratio of two-thirds foliage plants to one-third flowering plants (3]. When planting a container that will be viewed only from one side, it’s a good idea to start in the back with the tallest plants and work your way forward to the shortest.",en,books
"Horse Water Ballet
Colby: So, shifting gears (and equestrian pursuits), today the Olympic Grand Prix dressage competition got underway in Greenwich. And we kicked the day off with a proper celebration: Sarah wore the human-sized foam finger outfit (yes, that’s a thing…don’t believe me, please see our YouTube channel).
Sarah: the security guards were all about the foam finger suit, offering up smiles, laughter and high-fives all around. I did manage to set off the metal detector, thanks to my tall boot zippers and the mic pack, so they gave me a very thorough wanding, but once they were satisfied that I was just a weird American and not a terrorist, they happily let me through. So, the lesson of the day is: you can’t bring a water bottle into the venue, but a foam finger suit is a-OK.
Colby: Along with our friends from USEF, we then proceeded to spread joy to the fans by handing out “Dressage is #1″ foam fingers and encouraging the crowds to cheer for Jan and Rafalca. We created what can best be described as a scene, but it was really fun and we met some great people from all over the world.
Sarah: You would not believe how fast these things went. We literally couldn’t pull them out of the box all the way before there were three eager pairs of hands on each one. I loved how many people got really excited about it – and not just kids. 20-something guys, 60-year-old grandmas, literally everyone wanted to get in on the fun. And what fun it was. I’ve never posed for so many pictures in my whole life. It’s really weird to think that I’m now going to be tagged as “weird foam finger girl” on about a thousand different Facebook pages. And today was only Day 1 of Dressage!
Colby: After jettisoning the foam finger, so as not to incite an Olympic riot by blocking people’s view of the competition, we settled into our seats. The weather has been a recurrent theme and if you were here you would know why. We enjoyed a few beautiful rides in the sun, including leader and hometown-favorite Hester’s gorgeous ride.
Then, ominous dark clouds rolled in and the skies opened up like I’ve frankly never seen before. The rain drops were the size of golfballs. Many went scurrying into the bowels of the stadium, but most people stuck it out. It rained so hard and so fast that we were immediately soaked to the bone and there was really no point in retreating. Steffen and Shannon Peters clearly reached the same conclusion and stuck it out in the downpour watching the competition next to us.
The weather was certainly a factor for some riders, including Canada’s David Marcus whose horse, Capital, did not want to play the game which unfortunately led to them being excused after a number of bucks and (unplanned) airs above the ground.
Then, as suddenly as it started, the clouds parted and the sun came out. Sarah and I came out of our huddles, pulled out our phones and started tweeting again. Thankfully, our camera is waterproof, so we didn’t go completely dark during the deluge and got some great pics, which we are happy to share with you.
Sarah: So. Much. Rain. At times the rain was so insane that it was actually funny. I think the weirdest part was that we didn’t really try to do anything to make it better. I mean, I zipped up my raincoat, but I didn’t run for cover or anything. I think Colby had a great point in that it was such an instantaneous soaking that running really wouldn’t have done us any good. But it was a very weird feeling to just sit there and accept the pouring down rain and the soaking wet clothes as my new life. It kind of felt like being that horse that stands in the corner of the field in the midst of a downpour, even though the shed sits empty mere feet away. After sitting through it, I gotta tell you, there’s something wrong with that horse.
As for the actual competition, to say that the Brits came out strong would be such a tremendous understatement. Of the 26 pairs that competed today, the Team GB riders went 1 and 2 atop the leaderboard, which is beyond impressive. After Hester’s #1 ride, he joked with the media that he was worried his horse Uthopia might be deaf, given the fact that the horse is just 11 years old, has never competed in a stadium and literally didn’t bat an eye (or an ear) at the very boisterous hometown crowd.
Team USA only saw one rider, Jan Ebeling, go today, as Tina, Steffen and Adrienne are all slated for tomorrow. Jan put in a test that he was very happy with. The portions of the ride that he’s been focusing on (passage, piaffe and halt) all came out beautifully. They had a small bauble in the canter pirouette, but nothing drastic, and they put in a solid score of 70.243 to get the US off to a very respectable start. We caught up with Jan and several other members of the Team USA crew during the USEF Network shoot tonight, so be sure to keep your eyes peeled for that.
The dismissal of the Canadian pair Colby mentioned above is noteworthy because now Team Canada is down to two riders, and thus eliminated from the Team portion of the competition, which you hate to see happen.
The final noteworthy portion of the competition was witnessing the 71-year-old Hiroshi Hoketsu put in a lovely test about the very sweet-seeming horse, Whisper.
In a quick post-ride interview, Hoketsu spoke about the difference between the games now and his first Olympics an astounding 48 years ago. The biggest thing he noted was the quality of the horses and the training. That really got me thinking how much we’re really working to improve the way that we breed, train and care for these magnificent animals, and, as a result, we’re elevating the sport to a whole other level. And as I reflect on that thought now, sitting in my bedroom staring out at the deconstructed cross country course, I feel incredibly proud and honored to be a part of the small role that SmartPak plays in making the world a better place for horses and their riders.

"Figuring Out A Fenway Double-Rainbow Riddle
Like us on Facebook hereFollow @mlbreports
Wednesday, January.16, 2013
By Guest Blogger Jason Alpert-Wisnia (son of) Saul Wisnia, Red Sox Correspondent (Read his blog ‘Fenway Reflections’ here): Follow @SaulWizz
In 2000, my dad Saul got an email from a friend with an amazing photo of a double rainbow the friend had taken during a Red Sox game at Fenway Park. My dad was at the game too, and many fans who were there took photos similar to the one he received. Soon the internet was filled with them.
(If you don’t understand or know what a “Double Rainbow” is, here is a link to the original YouTube video that started the trend. It’s by Hungrybear9562.) Make sure you play the audio.
Now, 13 years later, my father still had the photo and was using it as desktop wallpaper on his computer. He had forgotten, however, when it was taken, who was playing the Red Sox, who was batting, and all the other information about this amazing photograph. On the old JumboTron scoreboard at Fenway you can see the number 20 (or maybe 10) faintly, and the other words and numbers are fuzzy too. Also, it’s hard to tell who’s batting (the Red Sox or the visiting team) because all the uniforms seem the same shade of white.
We thought it would be fun to figure out this mystery.
We Googled “Double Rainbow over Fenway Park Photo.” One of the first links was to a company selling the photo: http://www.nytstore.com/1/1/4413-fenway-park-rainbows-2000-nsap568.html The ad stated that the picture was taken during “July 2000” when the Red Sox were playing the Atlanta Braves, both facts which my dad had forgotten. But there was one downfall; it did not state the exact date.
So we went to http://www.baseball-reference.com, and looked up the 2000 Red Sox. We then went into the season schedule for the month of July. We looked over the games for any dates when they played the Braves at Fenway; they met the Braves on July 8th and 9th. We then looked over the Red Sox’s lineup for those games, because we were pretty sure they were the team batting in the picture.
We were wrong! None of the players on the Red Sox roster that year wore the number 20.
We then looked over the Braves lineup for the same two games. None of them had the number 20 either. So we decided that maybe it was number 10. The only player on either team’s roster for those two games who wore the number 10 was Chipper Jones.
Mystery solved? Not so fast.
In the original photo, the first name of the player on the scoreboard looked too short to be “Chipper,” but when we enlarged the picture we realized the player actually had on a Red Sox cap .
How could this be?
We went back over the season schedule, and noticed we had missed a game against the Braves on July 7th!
Looking at the Red Sox lineup for THIS game, I found the perfect match. The starting catcher on July 7th was Scott Hatteberg, and he wore number 10 on the Red Sox for all of 2000.
Now that we knew the batter, we decided to go deeper into the mystery. We wanted to know what inning he was batting in, and against what pitcher.
I looked up the pitchers who played for the Braves in that game, and they were Tom Glavine, John Rocker, and Kerry Ligtenberg. Going over the inning-by-inning linescore, we saw that Hatteberg batted in the bottom of the 2nd, as the third batter, and struck out against Glavine. He also came up in the bottom of the 5th, and hit a ground ball out off Glavine.
In the photo you can see that there is a player on first base. I looked closer at the bottom of the 2nd to see if someone had reached first. The first batter, Ed Sprauge, walked. Then the next batter before Hatteberg, Manny Alexander, had hit a fly ball out to right field. So Hatteberg’s first time at bat, there was indeed someone on first base. His second time up he led off the inning, so that would not work.
So, in my dad’s screensaver photo and the many other double rainbow shots matching it, Scott Hatteberg is batting against Tom Glavine and the Atlanta Braves on July 7th, during the bottom of the 2nd inning.

Millions of people love to go out on New Years Eve and drink and party until the sun comes up. Unfortunately there are those who don't plan out how to get home once the party has stopped, which leads to making bad driving decisions or getting rides home from other drunken strangers. Driving home drunk is a way to ruin your life with a DUI and/or to ruin multiple lives through serious or fatal car accidents. New Years (or any other outing) does not have to end this way.
The following are several reasonable options for getting home safely if you've had too much to drink. Even better, most of these options (if planned out ahead of time) allow you to go out and drink as much as you want and know that your ride home is taken care of.
Good luck and have fun!

Have you ever wondered why when you're poor and struggling there are always things coming up that seem to suck extra dollars out of your paycheck? You thought your check was say $500, but before you can turn around you're down to three or four hundred bucks and you haven't paid a single bill yet?
If this seems to keep happening don't worry you are not alone. You are just a victim of the old adage of why the rich stay rich and the poor stay poor. Your problem is simple - you are paying way too much Poverty Tax.

The human body is an amazing machine. No matter how much you abuse it with crappy food, lack of exercise, and a general beating it always manages to try to heal itself. Nowhere is this more evident in relation to smoking. Cigarette smoking is one of the most damaging things you can do to your body as it scars your lungs, restricts your breathing, affects your arteries and restricts heart function. With all that said, as soon as you stop smoking your body immediately begins to repair itself.
For those quitting ""cold turkey"" the chart below (courtesy of WhyQuit.com) shows the typical progression of healing that a body goes through. Each person is different, but these guidelines should give you hope if (and when) you decide to give up smoking.

I think we all can agree that smoking is bad for your health. For those out there that do smoke you are probably tired of hearing people tell you all the reasons you should quit and I am sure that many of those things go in one ear and out the other. Ultimately quitting smoking comes down to a personal choice and an amazing will power that allows you to break the nicotine addiction.
One of the main reasons people ultimately do give up cigarettes is the lack of ability to do basic cardio activities. We're not talking about running a mile, we're talking about walking up a flight of stairs or chasing your kids around the park. If this is your reason for quitting this article gives you some good news. soon after you quit your lung function can return to normal and you can do all of the physical activities you want. Here are some tips on how to get there.

The collapse of the housing market in 2008 has had a devastating impact on individual families and the economy as a whole. Outside of the wave of foreclosures there has also been a significant decrease in property value which has sapped the wealth of millions of homeowners. The other side of that coin however has been the resulting low home prices and historically low interest rates that are the direct result of the bubble.
If you are looking to buy a home 2012 may be an excellent time to buy as there are several cities across the country where you can buy a home for less than $150,000 with an extremely low interest rate. The combination of low interest rates and low home prices mean that many people can afford to buy a home even with a salary as low as $20,000 a year.

No one can right all the wrongs of history, but when there is an opportunity to do so we must take advantage of it. In 1971 a group of students and a political activist (dubbed the ""Wilmington Ten"") were convicted of arson in 1971 under very suspicious circumstances. After given extraordinarily long sentences (some up to 35 years) for a non-violent crime, the Ten were released after serving almost a decade in prison.
As the truth was revealed about the jury (of several KKK members), the recantation of all eyewitness testimony, and the revelation of prosecutor misconduct the Wilmington Ten are asking for official pardon for their crime. Below is a letter to that effect from one of the Ten, Wayne Moore.

Black meteorologists Rhonda Lee was fired from her job at Louisiana-based KTBS after defending her short hair style on Facebook.
The news media is a tough industry to break into. It can be especially difficult for a young black woman trying to make it on her reporting skills and talent while constantly being judged based on appearance and other superficial traits. Nowhere did this manifest itself in such an ugly manner as when Rhonda Lee, an African American weather reporter was fired from her job after defending her choice of hair style.
Rhonda Lee had been a weather reporter for Shreveport, Louisiana-based KTBS where she provided on-air coverage of the weather. In late October the station received a note on their Facebook page from a reader who took exception to her appearance:

I originally had such high hopes for the CNN series Black In America. Finally there was a platform on a national news outlet that was going to tackle issues directly related to Black people in America. Indeed the first episode did a good job educating both white and black America about certain aspects of the black experience. Several of the subsequent episodes however, have left me wanting.
This latest installment ""Who is Black in America"" critically highlights how far the show has stumbled from its lofty beginning. CNN has gone from discussing relevant African American issues to now spending an hour trying to tell us we don't know who is black.

We’re so very excited to be collaborating with the hippest Bridal web site on the internet, Offbeat Bride. They are doing a write up on Sock Dreams today and we decided the article should be about all the fabulous bridal party socks that folks get from us every summer, especially when it comes to silly groomsmen socks.
In the spirit of this article, we have decided that we would do a GIVEAWAY in conjunction. All you brides and grooms to be, get out your pens and your box o’ Kleenex, ’cause our giveaway will be an essay on “How I met and chose my bridal party.”
We want to know all the messy, hilarious, tear-jerking ways that you picked the folks who will stand up with you on your special day. Extra points if you have a cross-gendered wedding party, which I was a part of last summer, or something else totally nontraditional.
Our first place winner will receive a $150.00 gift card to Sock Dreams, which can be used to purchase bridal party socks or broken up in any way to use as gifts for your party… or you could just keep it all to yourself.
There is no minimum word count to enter and all entries will be judged by the folks here at Sock Dreams.
To enter, please send your essay to email@example.com by May 23rd 2013, and be sure to include all the important information such as your name and email. The contest ends and will be judged by May 24th, 2013, so the prize will be awarded just in time for all those June weddings.
Good luck! And good life!
The Doggie Dash is the annual fundraiser for the Oregon Humane Society, whom every year rescues a variety of animals and places them in good homes. As some of our fans may know, we have several dogs in our offices here in Portland, and just as many folks in the office who love our furry pals. The Doggie Dash will take place on Saturday May 11th down at the Tom McCall Waterfront Park in Portland; those of you in the Portland area who might want to come down and join the dash. For those of you not in the Portland area, you can still help us meet our Sock Dreams team goal by clicking here and registering for the Sock Dreams team.
Additionally, on Saturday May 11th, the Luna Foundation will be holding Whiskey Fest NW to benefit CASA of Multnomah and Washington Counties. Whiskey Fest will be held at NW 11th and Northrup in the heart of Portland’s Pearl District, where several of the top whiskey makers will be sampling out their best to raise money for children’s advocacy in Portland. We have been asked to vend and represent Sock Dreams by bringing whiskey themed socks, as well as our Sock Dreams brands and our smiling faces. Tickets are going fast, but are still available for this event on the Whiskey Fest NW web site.
Have a great weekend, we hope the sun is shining where you are!!!

When most people think of Oregon, they think of rain; and with good reason. Portland alone gets an average of around 37 inches of rain a year, and often times it feels like we should start gathering animals two by two.

May is a marvellous month, with Emeralds, Lily of the Valley and Taurus as its symbols. Bold, dainty and terribly stubborn; which is a pretty good description of how this month is turning out for us in Portland, with blasting hot days, delicately warm nights and a mind of its own regarding the weather!
All this sun and April’s showers have made our world bright and green (and brought some of those May flowers too!). Which makes May’s gemstone very appropriate. Emeralds are green beryl, ranging from yellow-green to blue-green, but always green! And though we use the word “emerald” on only a couple of green styles, we have quite a wide representation of greens!
May’s flower, the lily of the valley, is like the shy cousin of the flamboyant lilies that dominate bouquets and their little bell shapes could easily be confused for any other sleepy-looking wildflower. The fleur-de-lis, on the other hand, is very recognisable. So we’ll let this stylised lily take center stage.
Like Aries last month, the May’s constellation of Taurus isn’t as dignified in sock form as it is in star form. But dang is it adorable! Both of these cow socks even have grippy bottoms to help keep you stable.
When we talk about “stockings” as opposed to “socks”, we mean the high-nylon content styles that more often than not have to be held up with a garter belt. Though most are sheer some, like the Lycra Cuban Heeled Two Tone Stockings (shown on the far right), are semi-opaque.
On top: Ultra Sheer Retro Backseam Stockings. Beneath, from left to right: Lycra Cuban Heel Stockings, Cuban Heel Thigh Highs, Lycra Sheer Cubans with Lace Up Tops, Lycra Cuban Heeled Two Tone Stockings.
Flattering, fancy and just the thing to finish off a dressy outfit, nylons have a fascinating history. Though our focus here at Sock Dreams is on socks, we do carry and love stockings. And we’re also big nerds who love to share history and facts. Today I’ll share a quick overview of the history of nylons, with some helpful facts for folks interested in rocking these classic and classy stockings. If you want more info, there are great, in-depth, histories of stockings all over the place. I’m super partial to the Smithsonian’s Stocking Series.
Nylon stockings were introduced at the 1939 world’s fair by Dupont, who have a great little timeline with some awesome pictures from 1939. They decided against registering “nylon” as a trademark, so that the word would become synonymous with stockings. Early stockings had back seams and when folks had to give up their nylon stockings for the war effort, they reproduced that backseam with leg makeup (great article at GlamourDaze about it!), creating the illusion that nylons were still covering their legs. I love this picture we have on our Pinterest from the Library of Congress image archives, showing a barrel of nylons on their way to becoming parachutes and cords.
Library of Congress, Prints & Photographs Division, FSA/OWI Collection. “Here’s where your parachute came from.“
It’s because of this temporary lack of nylon that we have the wide range of cotton stockings and tights we see today. But that’s a story for another day! We’re still talking about nylons. Join us after the jump for comparisons of new nylon stockings to actual mid-century pairs and some helpful tips about these fantastic, feminine stockings.
A good mama is a wonderful thing and a hard job. If you’ve got a great mom in your life you should let them know how fabulous they are all the time. And if you’re a rad mom, I hope you know how great you are. Mother’s Day is just one day out of the year (this year it’s May 12th), but it’s a chance to really treat these wonderful folks.
We’ve got a Mother’s Day Favourites section, but most of those styles are the ones our moms like, and if your moms are like ours, they keep their fancy stuff pretty basic. They like comfy crews, cozy bedsocks, maybe a ‘crazy’ splurge on some hand-printed trouser socks.
But, the best gifts are the ones that you know the giftee would never think to get themselves. Something fancy, maybe a little more than they like to spend on themselves. Our Indulgences section is a good place to go for just that sort of thing. I’m going to be honest, these are our pricier styles. But they earn their price, with fabulous fibers, fit and construction. This is where the luxurious stuff lives.
That doesn’t mean you have to go wild picking something out for your moms. There are some great options under $25 that feel fantastic and look gorgeous. Plus, they’re practically basics, so you won’t get chided for going overboard.
Of course, if you can and do want to spoil your mom, we can help you there! Check out three sweet indulgences after the jump!
April 26th, 2013
They can be unsightly, those little balled-up bundles of fibers that build up on your socks. Where there’s wear, pills will happen; common causes are shoes rubbing against socks, where your thighs touch or really any spot that is subjected to abrasion.
Wool and acrylic are especially prone to pilling (though cotton, polyester and nylon like to do it too). Linen and silk are the safest from the perils of pilling. Wool has an advantage, as it is more likely to shed pill build-up. Synthetic fibers are tougher and more stubborn, keeping those pilled bits secure to the fabric. Washing pill-prone items inside out on a short, gentle cycle (or hand washing) helps prevent this kind of wear, but often it is inevitable.
However or whyever there are pills, they’re a problem that you can solve. One of the most common ways is with an electric sweater shaver. Electric sweater shavers are fun and kind of loud (which is also fun). They require batteries and are sort of like a teddy bear’s version of a beard trimmer. A lot of them are even made by the same companies who make electric face razors!
And one of those can bring some freshness back to a tired looking pair of socks or armwarmers, like this pair of Harajuku Arm Warmers. That area between the thumb and fingers gets a lot of wear and shows it.
But all it takes is turning on the sweater shaver and lightly running it over the arm warmer, either while wearing it or laying it flat. The key word here is lightly, just gently brush the shaver across the top. If you’re too rough you could put a hole in whatever you’re sprucing up, particularly if it is a delicate item.
And the pills are gone, turned into easily-disposed of fluff! The softer look of a much loved-and worn item doesn’t disappear, but the pills do. It even does a solid job removing all the pills on the heels of my poor old Extraordinary Thigh Highs, which have had a lot of hard wear.
Electric sweater shavers are definitely rad, but there have to be some non battery powered options out there, right? Tumblr Fairy Zaf prefers the Sweater Stone and I’ll walk you through that technique next. Why don’t you let us know your tips and tricks for removing pills? In looking up information on pilling I saw that some folks use the hook side of Velcro—have you tried it, does that work? I’ve definitely gone the sticky tape route myself.
Knee highs are pretty straight forward. Our Measurements & Sizes page shows how they come to just below the knee, that’s pretty much the total of their definition. But you may have encountered the phrase “knee sock” when browsing our styles and wondered how it differed from plain ol’ knee highs.
There isn’t a whole lot of difference and sometimes we do use the phrase “knee sock” when we’re talking about knee highs. But, more often than not, when we call something a “knee sock” we’re talking about a sock that ends somewhere around the knee—sometimes below, sometimes above, sometimes right there in the middle of your knee cap—depending on your leg shape. The Bess Cashmere Slouch Rib Knee Socks are a perfect example of this, you can see how they end at different spots on different models’ legs:
Since we try on all the styles we sell and almost all of the models you see in our pictures are Sock Dreams employees, we get to see how socks act on different leg types. Long legs and fuller calves mean some shorter over the knee styles don’t fairly deserve the name “OTK”. But those same socks can’t properly be called knee highs either because just as many other folks had them go over their knees. So, we started using the phrase “knee sock” to highlight that ambiguity.
It was Sourpuss’ styles that made us first start using the phrase more actively, they’re shorter for over the knee styles and even though Sourpuss called them OTKs, we couldn’t after testing them, even though we love them.
The DreaM Stockings “knees” styles are another great example of a knee sock. Available in seven variations (with lots of varieties for each!), they can be worn as over the knee socks or knee highs, depending on your legs (or on your personal taste, I prefer them as knee highs, even though I’ve got short legs).
A way to find these in-betweeners is also to choose both “knee high” and “OTK” in Advanced Search then click the word “ALL” next to the header for Coverage. This shows you styles we’ve found fall both above or below the knee, depending on your leg. If you’ve got longer legs or fuller calves, you may already know the trick of wearing OTKs as knee highs, cuffing or double-cuffing to take care of any extra length.
A knee sock isn’t a style that couldn’t cut it as an OTK, nor is it just an over-achieving knee high. They straddle both coverage worlds, offering their stylish services to more leg types.

"Marriott to Certify More than 85 Hotels With Energy Star Label
Marriott International, Inc. (NYSE:MAR) announced today that more than 85 hotels will earn the ENERGY STAR label – signifying 35 percent less energy use than average buildings – from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) this year. With more than 200 ENERGY STAR-labeled hotels currently, Marriott continues to lead the hospitality industry in energy management and has set a goal to certify at least eight hotels per month with the ENERGY STAR award. Today, twelve hotels in Boston are being recognized at the Boston Marriott Quincy.
The 12 hotels earning the ENERGY STAR label today include: Boston Marriott Quincy; SpringHill Suites Peabody; SpringHill Suites Boston Andover; Courtyard Boston Norwood; Courtyard Boston Woburn/Boston North; Courtyard Boston Danvers; Courtyard Boston Lowell/Chelmsford; Courtyard Boston Foxborough; Courtyard Boston Stoughton; Courtyard Boston Milford; Residence Inn Boston Tewksbury/Andover; and TownePlace Suites Boston North Shore/Danvers.
“We are excited to add these twelve in Boston to our ENERGY STAR group of hotels,” said Pat Maher, senior vice president, Engineering and Program Management, Marriott International, Inc. “We have a global initiative in place that focuses on environmentally friendly programs from energy and water conservation to wildlife protection, which began over 10 years ago.”
Marriott recently announced that it has reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 70,000 tons in one year–the equivalent of removing 10,000 cars from U.S. streets*–and is the first hotel company to proactively join the prestigious EPA Climate Leaders Program. Additionally, the company has set a five-year goal to reduce greenhouse gases by six percent per guest room by 2010.
Marriott’s commitment to the environment is longstanding. With the introduction of ECHO, Environmentally Conscious Hospitality Operations, more than a decade ago, Marriott focused on water and energy conservation, clean air, recycling, wildlife preservation and neighborhood cleanups. Marriott works in partnership with hotel owners and franchisees to implement sustainable environmental practices, which reflect the environmental interests and concerns of our guests, associates, business partners and communities.

Whoever said size doesn't matter, must have spent some time in Sackets Harbor, especially in the summer.
This charming village packs a lot of living in a tiny, tidy bundle, decorated with a beautiful waterfront, welcoming restaurants, entertaining and exciting activities and a rich history. While a round trip from Syracuse is easily done in a day, you'll need more than a day to do everything there is to do. But that's not a problem, because once you visit, you'll want to go back soon.
These picks will get you started. Enjoy the trip.
Old McDonald's Farm
14471 county Route 145, Sackets Harbor
Open 10 a.m. daily, May 1 through Oct. 31.
The 1,200-acre working farm, just a few miles outside the center of Sackets Harbor, has been open to visitors since 1986. Owner Nancy Robbins used to give children pony rides in her driveway. Friends suggested she set it up as a business; now people line up to pay for the pony rides and much more.
At the farm, city kids (and adults) enjoy close encounters with a wide variety of barnyard animals. There are bunnies, goats and pigs -- including handsome Fabio and gorgeous Giselle and their babies -- chickens, cows and miniature horses. One horse is named Rod Stewart because he's quite popular (and prolific) with the lady horses.
But even kids who live in rural areas are enchanted by the one-hump camel named Humphrey, two emus named Stretch and Stilts, three Alpacas named Marshmallow, Salsa and Paprika and a reindeer named Poinsetta, who has such a beautiful, velvety face and antlers she doesn't look real.
Admission to the farm costs $7 for anyone older than 1 and includes interacting with the animals, taking a spin on the Wizard of Oz-themed hayride and playing mini golf. It costs extra to bounce in the inflated playground, to ride the ponies or to feed the goats popcorn (fists full of grass are free). The half-hour dairy tour on the Moo-Town Trolley costs an additional $2 for adults, but is free for children.
The narrated dairy tour showcases the modern dairy industry. According to the narrator, the Robbins Farm milks 700 cows three times a day, seven days a week. Each milking takes seven hours, with an hour between shifts for the workers to sterilize the milking parlor. Visitors see the cows mill about in a free stall barn and stroll to the milking parlor when they feel the need. In the calf nursery barn, you may see a newborn baby struggling to its feet for the first time.
Of course, if you suffer from hay fever or other allergies, you can always opt to stay behind in Old McDonald's Laughing Cow Cafe or confine yourself to communing with toy animals in the gift shop.
Main Street, Sackets Harbor
Open 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily through Christmas. Winter hours: 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Friday through Sunday during January, February and March.
While Sackets Harbor's business district is just a few blocks long, it doesn't lack for inviting shops. One that's particularly intriguing is the Handmaiden's Garden on Main Street.
The shop, which is deceptively spacious, greets visitors with a veritable fairy fantasyland, filled with, of course, fairies as well as every possible fairy accouterment known to man or elf. There's fairy clothing, furniture, houses, ornaments, collectibles, jewelry and an assortment of boxes and other precious items designed to facilitate the tooth fairy's exchange of legal tender for teeth.
But the store doesn't end there. Walk up a couple steps and you're in a mini bookstore with floor to ceiling shelves stocked with New Age books, games and spiritual and psychic aids.
Keep moving, and you'll find a couple of rooms devoted to Sacket Soapworks, which offers custom scenting, all-natural bath and body lotions, potions and soaps. Connie Nicolette, the shop owner, grows the herbs in her garden and makes more than a ton of soap in her workshop each year, which she sells in the shop, online and at the Sterling Renaissance Festival.
Nicolette started selling her handmade soaps at the Henderson Harbor Farmers Market back in 1996 as a way to make extra money and still home-schools her children. She enlisted her then 12-year-old son to help launch and build the business, equipping him with business cards and a computer. One of his home-school assignments was to design and make labels for the business. Nicolette's daughter, Cassidy, and her fascination with fairies, led her to begin stocking and selling fairy paraphernalia, a sideline that has become just as lucrative as the bath and body business.
Through her business, Nicolette says she hopes to help others appreciate nature and a world filled with wonder.
""Children are getting so stuck into this high-tech world of games, they're losing their imagination,"" she says. ""I just want to give that back ... and bring little ones back to nature.""
Karen's Kafe & Bistro
West Main Street, Sackets Harbor
Open 11 a.m. daily.
Owner Karen Bendix earned Philly cheesesteak fame at her former restaurant, Karen's at Brookside, near Princeton, N.J. When the state of New Jersey seized the property under eminent domain for an intersection, Bendix closed the doors after 30 years and carried her recipes to Sackets Harbor to start over.
The transplanted restaurant, which Bendix estimates has attracted at least 1,000 of her former customers to Sackets Harbor, became Karen's Kafe & Bistro. It's a petite place in the heart of town with a sunny outdoor seating area that dwarfs the building, featuring large colorful umbrellas and plenty of comfortable seating.
The Philly steaks still steal the show, with 16 varieties including one called Cusabi, which has a cucumber and horseradish dressing. Another favorite is the Ruben Cheese Steak with Swiss cheese, sauerkraut and Thousand Island dressing. Side dish choices include favorites like sweet potato fries and Karen's version of that Canadian favorite, poutine. Her version features french fries topped with mozzarella cheese, jalapeno peppers and red sauce.
Treats like the Family & Friends Banana Sundae, a jumbo confection big enough to feed a crowd, and 100 flavors of shakes and smoothies, are made with homemade ice cream. Be sure to ask about the Oxymoron Extraordinaire and the Pie du Jour. Wine and beer are available, including locally-brewed 1812 Amber Ale.
Karen brags that her staff is a ""friendly, fun-loving, hysterically funny group"" and the busier the place gets, the wilder they behave, all with her blessing. And, when yucky weather forces diners inside the tiny 25-seat restaurant, she says it often gets raucous, turning into one big, boisterous group, all sharing conversation and laughs, table-to-table.
And, according to the menu, four-legged customers are welcome as well.
""Ask your server for complimentary dog biscuits, water available upon request,"" the menu reads.

In case you've forgotten, the United States declared war on Great Britain in the War of 1812. The reasons were varied, but the bottom line was the Americans hoped to finally kick the British out of the rest of North America, aka Canada. Some historians see the 1812 conflict as a second Revolutionary War, but it doesn't seem to get the respect that the first one got. Except in Sackets Harbor.
According to the Chamber of Commerce's 2009 Visitors' Guide, the village, located just 30 miles across Lake Ontario from Canada, had been an important shipping and shipbuilding center, which made it a natural choice to be the northern frontier headquarters for the U.S. military in 1812.
Sackets Harbor has carefully preserved the history of its role in fighting the British and Canada to keep them from claiming this part of the country.
History aficionados can walk the 32-acre hallowed ground of the Sackets Harbor Battlefield State Historic Site, observing the Memorial Tree Grove and monument on the site of the former Navy Yard. During the summer, the park's Living History Camp features actors depicting soldiers and other characters who might have lived there during the War of 1812. They take their roles very seriously.
For a nominal admission fee, visitors may tour a home inhabited by a dozen different U.S. Navy Commandants and their families. In what was the site of the former stable, visitors may participate in hands-on naval activities such as lifting different size cannon balls, pulling boat rigging and sighting and firing a cannon at an enemy ship that appears to be tossing on the high seas.
When the cannon is fired, the cannonball can be heard screaming toward its target. A direct hit results in a loud explosion, followed by sailors shouting and wailing. Miss, and the sailors laugh at your ineffective attempt. Next door, in the mini theater, two DVDs about the War of 1812 and the Battle of Sackets Harbor play continually.
The nearby Pickering-Beach Historical Museum depicts Harbor life in the mid-19th century. According to the Web site (www.sacketsharborny.com), local legend says an unrestored cottage on the property, which is next to the battlefield, served as a hospital during the War of 1812.
Just to prove there are no lingering hard feelings after all these years, Sackets Harbor invites its Canadian neighbors to the 38th annual Can-Am Festival (www.canamfestival.com) on July 18 and 19, to thank them for being such good neighbors.

"Designer, Vanessa De Vargas has done just that with her most recent design charity for the Mary Magdalene Project. She was brought onto this project by Hartman House - a non profit company who rehabs homes in the US & in other countries.
Looking for local charities to help they reached out to the Mary Magdalene project, which is a safe home for women who are victims of sex trafficking in L.A.
The home needed a major redo - everything was OLD. Hartman House brought Vanessa in to do this project. She, along with Jordan Cappella, completed the decor in just 4 days! Several vendors came in with donations & this was the result of their work! I can imagine this put a SMILE on so many of the women's faces.
Great job, don't you think?

"To the Editor:
I am so excited about the governor's bill pending approval from the Senate on marriage equality, and wrote my state senators for support. I just got an e-mail reply from Sen. David Valesky saying, ""I have continuously supported civil unions for the purpose of benefits for couples, as opposed to same-sex marriage.""
I was so disappointed! Sen. Valesky, hasn't history shown us time and again that separate is not equal? Marriage is a civil contract, and in New York state alone, 1,324 rights and responsibilities come with that ""contract."" I know for a fact that many of these rights cannot be obtained legally in any other way than by having a marriage certificate.
If your personal beliefs or religion oppose same-sex marriage I can respect that, but please be aware that civil marriage is not the same as religious marriage, which is sanctioned by the faith of a person's choice. Having civil marriage equality will not compel any religious entity to perform same-sex marriages unless they see fit to do so. The separation of church and state will continue to exist!
My same-sex spouse and I were legally married in Massachusetts last summer, and certainly do not want to be considered ""civilly unioned""! We are married just like any other committed, loving couple. Our friends, family and our community in Syracuse all respect us and our marriage. We love each other, we take care of one another, and we are committed to each other just like any other married couple. Is it really possible that Dave Valesky doesn't have any same-sex couples as friends or relatives, and just has no frame of reference for this?
Unless civil unions will impart the exact same rights and responsibilities, this is certainly not equality under the law for New York citizens such as myself and my spouse. And, Mr. Valesky, if you are implying that your support of civil unions will impart the exact same rights and responsibilities under the law, then please call it marriage, because that's what it is!
Political gain and personal opinions aren't going to last forever on this issue, and civil rights will eventually prevail, as they have throughout history. Sixty years ago, blacks and whites could not legally marry each other, yet I doubt there is a politician in New York today who would dare suggest now that they shouldn't have that right. I would hope that Sen. Valesky would rather be known as a leader who did what was right instead of a leader who tried to sustain a category of second-class citizens.
Religious conservatives just want to follow God's law
To the Editor:
Most newspaper opinion letters hit the religious right very hard -- considering them bigots for wanting to deny civil rights of marriage to gay couples. As one of the religious right, it is evident to me they don't know the real reasons for our wanting to keep marriage between a man and a woman.
It starts with our core beliefs that put God first in our lives -- not government. We believe our Creator instilled a special spirit within us that is the distinguishing essence of our humanity. Furthermore, we believe we were created by God so that we may choose to love God and others with a selfless and enduring spiritual love.
With that affirmed, it follows we want marriage to be what God wants, and we believe that to be a promise to God from a man and a woman to love each other spiritually and to nurture children with the same spiritual love. For it is this marriage that gives children their best chance for happiness and perpetuates all-important family love.
To those who are gay, we can only hope they also choose to love God and others spiritually so that they, too, will find happiness on Earth and have their souls merit heaven.
Please believe it isn't that the religious right wants to deny gay couples their civil rights; it is that we are trying our best to live our lives in accordance with God's wishes.
Gay couples sometimes do better at raising kids than others do
To the Editor:
It has been interesting to keep up with the ongoing debate about gay marriage on these pages. I won't claim to know what God's sense of this is, as many writers claim to. Like John Spong, the Bible scholar and Episcopal bishop of New Jersey, wrote, God is way too awesome, and us trying to figure out God is like an earthworm trying to figure us out.
Pragmatically speaking, gay marriage isn't a problem. No marriage is. I noticed in the obits today that the man shot dead by police in a gunfight had four children, with four different women, in four states, and wasn't caring for any of them. The foster care system here in Onondaga County is filled with parentless kids: My wife and I know -- we've cared for two of them.
I've been working on a documentary film about school dropouts, and if there is one common theme among dropouts, it is that they come from single- or no-parent homes. On the other hand, I am personally familiar with three gay couples who have adopted children, and those kids are thriving. Gay couples may not be able to have biological kids of their own, but they sure are picking up the slack left behind by the legions of irresponsible heterosexual procreators.
Same-sex marriage is opposed to moral law
To the Editor:
I do not believe in same-sex marriage. It is against nature and against moral law. The same-sex couple cannot physically complement each other as in heterosexual marriage.
Now, having said this, I will be accused of being narrow-minded, homophobic, judgmental and a religious fanatic.
Most people do not accept everything that comes down the pike; we are not that broad-minded. Jesus said in the Bible that you either follow him or Satan. It is one or the other, nothing in-between. Already in this country, people whose religious convictions preclude acceptance of this lifestyle are verbally and even physically persecuted. But Jesus told us this would happen if we followed Him.
An example of this is Miss California, Carrie Prejean, in the Miss USA Pageant, when she said she did not believe in same-sex marriage. Perez Hilton and many others like him verbally persecuted her.
The gay marriage advocates want to put us on the defense; that is part of their strategy. And for those who think I am judgmental, I am judging behavior, not the individual, for that would be placing myself as God. That is His domain. Our country has gone amok with all this political correctness to the point many, but not the majority, want God eliminated in all aspects that are against the gay agenda.
Let me point out to those who cannot see the forest because of the trees: Sodom and Gomorrah is already here. And What a great fall the United States will have if and when God lets His wrath rain down upon us ... unless we change our immoral and amoral ways.

"BA, BT, BP and many other famous British organisations come together to discuss the importance of their supply chains with the prime minister: Downing Street unveil a new support package to boost SME growth.
This week, David Cameron announced the Supply Chain Finance Scheme: a package that will provide cheaper finance for small businesses. This innovative programme will allow large companies to financially support their suppliers. The scheme aims to secure 10,000 business with increased levels of affordable finance whilst driving job and businesses growth.
In Downing Street, Cameron met with the faces of Britain's best known corporations to discuss the importance of larger business supporting their supply chains. Organisations include ASDA, Siemens and Kingfisher.
“This Government is determined to back all those businesses who aspire to get ahead and take on more people”, explained the prime minister. “In the current climate, viable businesses can struggle to get the finance they need to grow – this scheme will not only help them secure finance and support cash flow, but will help secure supply chains for some of our biggest companies and protect thousands of jobs.”
This scheme, already being implemented by the likes of Rolls Royce and Vodaphone, allows large organisations to vouch for their suppliers' incomes. In return, banks will allow the small and medium businesses access to credit to improve cash flow and lower costs within the supply chain. This is because larger companies generally have a strong credit rating and excellent access to fiance, whereas SMEs generally fund their working capital via overdrafts, invoice discounting or factoring.
Nigel Taylor, marketing director and head of e-invoicing solutions at B2B integration global leader GXS said: “It is encouraging that the UK government continues to recognise the economic challenges small and medium businesses currently face. Many smaller companies today are faced with a liquidity challenge - cash flow is always a priority and they are often challenged with a lengthy cash conversion cycle due to extended payment terms, late or even non-payment.”
This new mode of finance will also benefit larger companies, Taylor continues: “By ensuring their suppliers’ cash flow is more predictable and reducing working capital concerns they minimise supply chain risk.""
In practice, banks will be notified by the larger company that an invoice is being approved; the bank is then able to offer a 100 per cent immediate advance to the supplier at lower interest rates based upon their customer’s credit rating knowing the invoice will be paid.
“The new Supply Chain Finance scheme could help smaller firms in two key areas – improving their working capital and tackling the issue of late payments”, argued John Walker, national chairman, Federation of Small Businesses. “Nearly three quarters of small businesses report that they have been paid late in the past year, placing a huge strain on cash-flow and meaning they struggle to realise ambitions to grow.”
The package will make supply chains more cost effective, secure and effectively boost industry.
This week the Coalition explained they are keen to ensure that SMEs have the widest range of credit options available to them and is taking action on a number of fronts to deliver this. Number 10 calls attention to the various funding available, including the Funding for Lending scheme, to encourage banks to boost lending in the UK economy and a new £82.5m Start-Up Loan programme to help young people start their own businesses. By unleashing finance the government can unlock the true potential for many struggling SMEs.",en,reference
"On Saturday, September 1st, 2012, I attended my first ever Dragon*Con in Atlanta, Georgia. This was my first Con ever. I had heard so many amazing things about cons like Comic-Con that naturally, I was very excited! My first Panel of the day was a Panel at 1:00 called ""Remembering Jerry Nelson"". It was hosted by Heather Henson and another Henson Puppeteer who was also a musician. So basicly, He and Heather talked about Jerry and shared memories that they had with him. The Puppeteer told a great story of how he and Jerry made music together, and how he was even invited to perform on Jerry's ""Truro Daydreams"" album. The audience joined in with stories about Jerry and memories they had of him. I told my story of how my first scene of the Muppet show was when He snuck up on Kermit in his office! and that Uncle Deadly was my favorite Muppet. The Panel was finished with a song that the puppeteer wrote for Jerry along with a slideshow and it was beautiful. I really wish I could find it somewhere. Many people, including Heather, were crying. After the Panel, I thanked them both and talked with them for a minute.They were very kind and it was an honor being there with them both. So then I went on to exploring the con and it's many booths. It really was everything I dreamed it would be! Everyone was very polite and friendly. There were so many of my favorite movies and shows all crammed into one place, it was like a dream! My last panel I attended for the day was ""Puppetry for TV"" Hosted by Peter Linz. I was so excited! I sat down in the second row with my dad, and waited for the presentation to start. From the minute it started, It was non-stop fun! Peter and three other puppeteers from henson demonstrated how to basicly perform the Muppet Show, and they were hilarious!!! Peter performed Theo too! They even called up volunteers from the audience. I was a little nervous, so I just enjoyed the other volunteers performing. In fact, during the presentation, Peter called up a woman with a fraggle..named Janken! It was indeed Slackbot from these very forums! she performed a group routine with them, and then Peter asked the audience if they had any questions. I had a question in my mind, and when it finally came my turn, I asked ""Was Walter built special to whistle?"" Peter said that Walter actually has two heads, and that the ""Whistling"" head has two steel spring loaded devices that can be triggered to make the whistling motion. He also said that Walter can't talk as well with this head, because his mouth is stiff from the mechanism. After the panel, Peter said he would meet everyone outside at the puppetry tables(since they needed the room for the next panel). We waited for a few minutes, I talked to Slackbot and Janken, and I looked at the cool puppets on display at the table. I went to sign up for Heather's IBEX Puppetry newsletter on the table and when I turned around, right behind me was Peter Linz. He was really cool and very professional! He signed a picture for Slackbot and she said she was on Muppetcentral(It was at this point I realized she was Slackbot) When I asked her her name and she said ""Slackbot"" I said ""Seriously? My username is Walter!"" After he was finished talking to Slackbot, I asked him if ""I could ask Walter for an autograph"", he replied in Walter's voice "" What? me? sure!"" It was so awesome! He then took a picture with me and the photo.(at this point, a line formed of others wanting to meet him!) As I left I said ""Thank You so much!"" And he said, ""I like your username, I'll be looking for your posts!"" It was such an honor meeting him and learning from him. Between the amazing atmosphere and people of Dragon*Con, meeting Heather Henson, and meeting Peter Linz, This was the Best Day Ever!",en,books
"– 10 Years After Hijrah
“Bathe his body with water and Sidr and bury him with both garments,” said Allah’s Messenger. “Do not cover his head, nor touch him with Camphor ... for verily he will be returned (to Allah) on the day of resurrection in the state of Talbiyah! (Labbayk Allahaahumma labbayk)” – Al-Bukhari and Muslim ‘Amr ibn Al-‘Aas narrates, “When Islam entered my heart, I went to the Messenger of Allah and said, ‘Give me your hand so that I may pledge allegiance to you.’ The Prophet spread his hand, but I withdrew mine. He said, ‘What is wrong ‘Amr?’ I said, ‘I want to make a condition.’ ‘And what is that?’ he said. I said, ‘That Allah will forgive me.’ Then the Messenger of Allah said, ‘Did you not know that Islam wipes out what came before it, and that Hijrah wipes out what came before it and that Hajj wipes out what came before it!” - Sahih Muslim
The Ultimate Reward
Rasul Allah – sal Allahu alayhi wa sallam - said, “And there is no reward for an accepted Hajj … except Jannah!” What is the first verse that you read in Surah Al-Hajj? It does not speak of Arafah, nor does it pronounce the pillars of Nahr day. It simply says ... [O Mankind! Fear your Lord, indeed the eruption of the (final) Hour is a horrific event. On that day that you shall see it, every nursing mother will be engrossed away from that (child) she was nursing, and every pregnant woman will abort her pregnancy, and you will see the people (appearing) intoxicated, while they are not intoxicated; rather it is the punishment of Allah, severe.]
Hajj is not a journey of the body such as one may take to a vacation spot or tourist attraction. It is a journey of the soul and heart. When one pays a careful eye to the verses speaking of Hajj, they will find that verse after verse concludes with a commandment of being conscious of Allah’s presence, or a reminder of Allah’s bounteous favor upon us, or a link between Hajj and the final day.
In the not-so-far-away days of old, whenever a journey was to be undertaken proper provisions had to be prepared. The deserts were long, hot, and harsh. Unmerciful. There were no gas stations to fill up with chips and refreshments, or rest stops to slurp water from a fountain. In fact, there was not a human in sight for miles upon miles of barren sand dunes. Losing the way meant losing your life. Thus, you had to have the provision with you before you made the journey. Enough food, enough water, enough everything to carry you to your destination. From here, in the verses dealing of Hajj, when everyone shall have to make some sort of journey to reach the Ka’bah, Allah tuned the attention of His slaves to another journey, a journey every soul is traveling, whether they know it or care to just remain heedless. Allah turned their attention to the journey to the Hereafter, to Paradise or Hell. [And take sustenance (with you) for the journey; verily the best sustenance is Taqwa (piety and righteousness).] – Al Baqarah 2:197
On the day Buhaym Al-‘Ajlee set out with his companion for Hajj, he looked toward the endless desert awaiting them both and wept, his chest soaking from the tears. “This is something,” said Buhaym, “that has made me understand the most certain journey I must one day take to Allah!”
Hajj – The Journey Of Hearts
There is debate over whether someone who performs Hajj should be called a Hajji. It is not something found in the Sunnah; rather it has an interesting backround in our cultural history. In antique days, when someone decided to perform the journey for Hajj, it was synonymous with bidding farewell to life on earth. This was due to the treacherous obstacles of traveling in the desert - trials such as sickness, starvation, and the struggles of the separate situations. An entire village might gather to bid those people farewell. When someone would go through such a remarkable journey and return alive, they would dedicate their lives to the worship and obedience of Allah. Gone was the cheating, or the lying, or the missed Salah. He was now a Hajji. Today, with the Jumbo jets and ocean liners and Mercedes busses, the facilitation of performing Hajj has taken away the luster of the title Hajji.
Some might complain that there are no queen-size mattress beds in Mina, or that the air conditioning motor is a tad too loud. But dear brothers and sisters, who is it that provided us with all the blessing that we are living in? It is the same Allah that has tested us here on the plains of Arafah. The slave of Allah can only truly understand the favor of Allah upon him when it is taken away. [There is no blame upon you for seeking bounty from your Lord (during Hajj). But when you depart from Arafat, remember Allah at AlMash’ar AlHaram. And remember Him as He has guided you, for indeed you were before that among those astray.] Alhamdulillaah.
Indeed the greatest blessing that Allah has favored us with is Islam, and it alone suffices as favor. Allah knows we are going to get dusty during Hajj, Allah knows it. So don’t be surprised when that dust blows, instead turn to Allah and hit back with patience and a whisper of gratitude to Allah. [Then let them end their untidiness, fufill their vows, and perform Tawaf around the ancient House.] – Surah Hajj 22/29
Ibn Al-Qayyim wrote a Qasidah about this journey of the hearts, here is only a glimpse of some of the Arabic verses:
[He says, My slaves have come to Me (for Hajj) out of love for Me
And I am merciful to them, bounteous and loving
Glad tidings O participants of that stand (on Arafah)
a moment when Allah forgives all sins and showers His mercy]
Abu Hurayrah narrates: I heard the Prophet say, “Whoever performs Hajj and does not commit any Rafath (obscenity) or Fusooq (transgression), he returns (free from sin) as the day his mother bore him” – Al-Bukhari
Getting The Heart In Shape
Many years ago, as the Hujjaj swept through the valley of Muzdalifah, a man remarked out loud, “My look at the number of Hujjaj!” The wise man replied, “Nay, the passengers are many, but the Hujjaj are few.” I once heard the story of a man who was blessed with the opportunity to join the caravan for Hajj regularly. However, his shortcoming was that he could never control his anger during the days of Hajj, and would snap cursing others. Well, one person had an idea for him. His inspiration: Instead of cursing Muslims during Hajj, write all your bad comments on a piece of paper - fold it - and then when you get mad at someone, just hand him the paper. On the top of the tiny envelope write, ‘Do not open until after Hajj’. The man agreed. As incident after incident assailed him, the man would simply smile, then frown and hand out the tiny envelopes to the provoking party. Everything was going smoothly until the day when he was walking to the Jamarat and someone stomped his toes. He lost all control. Teeth gritting, he snarled and took out his briefcase of envelopes and dumped it on that poor guys head.
In Hajj I have seen people who snatch for patience and the reward of Allah during those trying moments, like a man pan handles for gold. I asked myself, what is different from them and those who spend their breath in criticism and argumentation? It finally dawned that it was not the body of Zayd or ‘Amr that I was witnessing, but it was the hearts of Zayd and ‘Amr. Some people come to Hajj prepared financially. Others come with a prepared heart – that is what’s essential. Whether the grindstone grinds us to dust or polishes us up depends on what we are made of.
Now - How To Get That Heart In Shape For Hajj?
Firstly: Attend lectures and workshops dealing with Hajj Hajj is one of the pillars that Islam is built on. When someone intends to perform this rite it a must upon them that they learn it well. Rasul Allah – sal Allahu alayhi wa sallam – said, “Seeking knowledge is obligatory on every Muslim.” Imam Al-Bukhari writes in his Saheeh, ‘Chapter: knowledge comes before statements and actions.’ He then quoted the verse of Allah: [So Know, that there is no deity except Allah and ask forgiveness for your sin.] - Surah Muhammad, 47/19
Secondly: Establish Salah and Perform Qiyaam ul-Layl
When Rasul Allah – sal Allahu alayhi wa sallam – was preparing his heart for the mission of conveying this Deen, Allah ordered him to prepare using Qiyam ul-Layl. Allah ta’ala says: [O you who wraps himself / Arise (to pray) the night, except for a little] – Surah Muzzammil, 73/1,2
A student once slept over at Imam Ahmad’s house, rahimahullah. Imam Ahmad had left a vessel of water for him, and upon arriving at Fajr time, found the vessel still full of water. He was shocked and remarked, “How can a person be a Talib Al-‘Ilm (student of Islam) and not stand for Qiyam ul-Layl!” Some said to Ibn Mas`ood, may Allah be pleased with him, ""We are unable to wake up to perform Qiyam ul-Layl."" He told them, ""You are distancing yourselves from it by your sins.""
Thirdly: Repentance to Allah and Dua
It was during the days of Tashreeq when Jirbreel – alayhis salam – came to Rasul Allah – sal Allahu alayhi wa sallam – with the words of Allah: [When the victory of Allah has come and the conquest / And you see the people entering into the religion of Allah in multitudes / Then exalt Him with praise of your Lord and ask forgiveness of Him. Indeed, He is ever Accepting of repentance.] Surah An-Nasr
This was the culmination of 23 years of Da’wah, Jihad, and work; here now was the farewell pilgrimage. What did it end with? [Then exalt Him with praise of your Lord (Tasbeeh) and ask forgiveness of Him]
Subhaanak Allaahumma wa bihamdika, Allahumma

"Longtime Jersey Shore tourists are waiting to see whether their favorite home will be renovated by summer.
SEASIDE HEIGHTS, N.J. — Tom Partyka bought three homes here, turned them into rentals, and braced himself for the run-of-the-mill headaches that come with being a landlord: a party that gets a little out of hand, a wall that needs patching, a window that must be fixed.
But 3½ feet of water, upended refrigerators, wiring that's been eaten away and homes rendered unlivable?
""It's like, come on, how much more can you take?"" said Partyka, 55.
The stock of Jersey Shore summer homes, once simply spruced up with a fresh coat of paint, now need mold removal experts and electrical contractors, delaying what traditionally has been the first indicator of the upcoming tourism season: summer rentals.
Visitors who have made Jersey Shore vacations a long-standing tradition are watching the progress closely, hoping still to return so they can pitch in on the region's recovery while enjoying their time along the beachfront.
But observers say they appear to be waiting to make their decisions until they can see if the beaches are replenished, the boardwalks are rebuilt or they can find an inhabitable rental.
""Some (landlords) are telling us they'll be ready by Memorial Day, others by the end of June,"" said Jeffrey Hallamore, manager of Diane Turton Realtors' office in Lavallette, N.J. ""It's really, truly a moving target.""
Laurie Sabella rents out two bungalows that she purchased in 2008 in Manasquan, N.J. She remembers having a long debate with her real-estate agent shortly after buying them about whether to allow tenants to have dogs, an issue that in retrospect seems trivial.
When Sabella and her husband, a contractor, got their first glimpse of the homes nine days after Hurricane Sandy, they could see the flood had reached eye-level. Water was in the top drawers of dressers and the microwave, too.
The Sabellas had flood insurance, but they weren't eligible for federal aid: The properties were secondary residences.
The homes had to be gutted with Sabella's husband doing most of the work. She thinks they will be ready in time for the summer.
""We have everything picked out,"" she said. ""We know the colors. Everything is in order. Once he starts going (with the renovation), it's going to have to go quick.""
Tourism generated $5.9 billion in Monmouth and Ocean counties in 2011, the latest figures available, according to a report by Tourism Economics research group. And many businesses at the end of this past summer reported that 2012 was stronger.
Yet since Sandy, visitors from northern New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania have been besieged with stories of flooded homes barely standing, of iconic beachfront businesses forced to close, of politicians fighting with Congress to get financial aid.
What effect has it had? A survey of New Jersey residents from Rutgers' Eagleton Institute of Politics released Feb. 18 found that 20% planned shorter visits this season.
Of those, two-thirds cited Sandy as the primary reason.
Even diehards, though, can't be sure. Phyllis Paolino, 60, of Hillsborough, N.J., said she has been visiting the Jersey Shore since her childhood. Now, she carves out a week each August when her friends and family gather here to go to the beach during the day and stroll up and down the boardwalk at night.
Images she has seen on television have left her teary eyed.
She sounded as if she would sign up today to visit the Jersey Shore this summer, even without the boardwalk intact, if only to show her support. But the home she has rented — that Partyka owns — is a work in progress.
""I think we'll wait it out a little bit,"" Paolino said. ""I think that's what most people will do. It's a shame because (owners of summer rentals and businesses) need to know people are coming.""
Observers said the Jersey Shore is making uneven progress.
Some New Jersey towns such as Lavallette appear to be on track to make it by Memorial Day. Others, such as Mantoloking and Ortley Beach, remain in rough shape.
Summer rental experts said they are faced with a season that likely will be touch and go, even well into the season.
Chris Fotache, owner of the Middletown, N.J.-based ShoreVacations.com, said visits to the summer rental website are down by about 20% compared with last year.
Meantime, Jeffrey Childers, a broker at Childers Sotheby's International Realty based in Normandy Beach, N.J., said rentals, typically about 75% full by this time, are only 15% to 20% booked this year, he said.
""People are kind of in a wait-and-see mentality,"" Childers said. ""Will the area be open? Will the beaches be cleaned up? In the past several weeks we've seen a sharp increase in inquiries. I think there will be a late surge this year.""
Tom Partyka is assuming as much. He and friend Bob Patten, a contractor, drive the 30 miles each morning from Partyka's Plumsted, N.J., home to Seaside Heights, where they have been renovating Partyka's three homes with the help of insurance proceeds and Partyka's savings.
To an outsider, the project appears massive, particularly without a huge team of contractors to lend a hand. And the summer, which once seemed such a long time away, is creeping closer.
But Partyka hasn't had much time to dwell. He said he is confident the homes will be ready for guests April 1.
""I'm going to be fully booked, absolutely,"" he said. ""Anything less than that, I'd be disappointed.""",en,web
"I have a well-deserved reputation for “writing long” at times. I’ve edited documents and provided suggestions that make the original significantly longer. But does that mean I’m less clear than someone who writes “short?” Absolutely not.
Mark Twain is remembered for apologizing for the length of a letter by saying it would have been shorter if he had more time. Having the time to edit is a great thing. But it can also be frustrating to deal with critics who are poised like raptors to point out that your e-mail directive asking for feedback or input is longer than the size of their computer screen — as if that’s a mortal sin.
In many cases where clarity is an issue, the problem is not too much information, it’s just poorly organized. Dictionaries work because the words are in alphabetical order; change the organization and a dictionary is pretty much useless.
Length in and of itself is not a determinant of clarity or simplicity. Cutting content may eliminate wordiness, but it may also eliminate critical information that helps readers understand the actions or gain perspective that the writer wants.
Warren Buffett’s annual letter to stockholders is a great example. It’s long — 18 pages — but readers flock to it for its insight (how his businesses have dealt with the financial crisis), its humor, and its views of where the economy is headed. I’ve never seen a word of complaint about its length, because the content is so valuable.
My advice is to worry less about the length of your e-mails, PowerPoints, and other writings and more about how you’ve organized them. Here are a few suggestions on ways to drive clarity, even if it is at the expense of brevity.
- Use bullets, particularly for action items. Length isn’t important if your reader clearly understands what you want them to do…and by when.
- Consider your audience — who should get it and perhaps more important, who shouldn’t. I’ve found that the people who whine the most about length are the ones who are least likely to respond anyway.
- Use subheads where appropriate. This includes tables of content, indexes, and other navigational aids. Vary your type (size, color, and boldness, not typeface) for emphasis and to draw the eyes to key points.
- Proofread. Between what Twittering and IMs and the like have done to people’s ability to communicate (particularly as it relates to spelling, punctuation, and word usage) and the desire to “publish” quickly, clarity often breaks down in the absence of the final “attention to detail” step. If you have time, ask someone else to read your document and tell you what you are asking the reader to do. Revise as necessary.
- Add a fourth word to those ABC’s mentioned above: Euphony. Making the document flow and sound or read in a pleasing, agreeable manner is a key component. It may take a few more words, but it’s well worth the effort.
Bulldog Simplicity celebrates clarity over brevity (although clear and short are certainly preferable). Your goal should be to ensure that everyone understands their responsibilities and their next steps and that it’s written in such a way that boredom or indifference doesn’t lead them to stop reading before the end.",en,books

The Colonel’s Folly And The President’s Distress
In a paper written in 1926 but now first published here, Woodrow Wilson’s personal physician refutes other accounts of the break with Colonel House
October 1964 | Volume 15, Issue 6
A little thing indicated the President’s agitation and consideration for Colonel House. It was part of his methodical habits always to wipe the ink from his pen and lay it carefully in the rack before he rose from his desk, but this time he got up quickly, with the pen still in his hand, and said: “Come with me.” We went to the Colonel’s bedroom; the President sat down on the edge of the bed, took the Colonel by the hand affectionately, and said: “Grayson tells me, my dear fellow, that you are worrying about a book which has just been published called The Real Colonel House . I want to tell you that I have not read it and I do not intend to read it, and it will make no difference in my confidence and faith and affection for you. So please forget it.” The Colonel looked up at him with moist eyes and pressed his hand. At that juncture I stepped out of the room. In a few minutes the President returned to his study and resumed his work. That evening the Colonel had on his dinner coat, joined the President, Mrs. Wilson, and myself at dinner, and was in his usual good spirits and conversational mood. In sheer human kindness the President had removed a great burden from an overstrained mind and restored health and normality to his good friend.
Mr. Wilson had so much deep personal feeling that notwithstanding his subsequent silence about Colonel House I am inclined to think that the disappointment in his old friend had its part in impairing his health. But he bled internally. After he was stricken in America and lay again in a sickbed, someone said something to him about writing to Colonel House (I do not recall what the subject was), but Mr. Wilson simply turned and said: “Don’t mention House to me any more. The door is closed.” An open quarrel would have been easier to bear than a silent grief.
The last time the two men met was in Paris on Saturday, June 28, 1919, when the President was taking the train for Brest, whence he was to embark for home. Most of the principal officials of the various governments were on the platform. Mr. Lloyd George, ill and exhausted, had said good-by to President Wilson at the temporary White House in Paris, but Mr. Arthur Balfour [British foreign secretary], who was very fond of the President both personally and officially, was at the station. So was President Poincaré, so was Premier Clemenceau. Several members of the French Cabinet and of the American Peace Commission, Premier Venizelos of Greece, and many other prominent participants in the Conference were there, including General Pershing and a number of Americans. M. Clemenceau, with a tremble in his voice and moisture in his eyes, said to me: “In saying good-by to the President I feel that I am saying good-by to my best friend.” When the whistle of the train sounded, many crowded around the President for a final farewell. Among them was Colonel House, who had a guilty expression as though he had not played fair. The President turned his head toward him, and, with a stern look, said coldly: “Good-by, House.”
They never met again.",en,books

However, all went fine. We got up, got ready, got everything packed up, stripped the beds, garbage out, final cleaning, and we were ready to go...an hour early! So we hung around and watched the clock tick, watched some t.v., listened to the radio.
The shuttle was to pick us up at 10:30 am. The guys that were picking up the keys were supposed to be there before that. The clock was getting ever closer to 10:30 and no sign of the guys. Sigh. Finally at 10:20 the kids started to take the bags downstairs. I started to follow, but the phone rang
It was the shuttle people saying the guy was there, waiting, and I had 10 minutes. OMG! I was trying to figure out what the heck I would do if the guys didn't show up...what would I do with the keys? There was a couple coming in this same day to take our place, they needed the keys. The owner had left for vacation in Morocco. Crap!
So as I finally started to go downstairs, I see DS taking the elevator down (it's glass). He had gone up one floor, then down, for fun. Then I went down with my bag. When I got at the bottom, this old French guy reprimands me (in French) that DS is too little to ride the elevator by himself and he might ""panique."" If I had not been ""paniqueing"" myself about the keys vs. the shuttle, I would have laughed at the guy. But as it was, I said, ""Oui, oui"" knowing I'd never see the guy again. Do the French raise their kids to be sissies or what? My son is eight years old for crying out loud.
So I helped the kids get in the shuttle with the luggage and told the guy I had to wait for the key guys. I then went inside the courtyard to wait. Fortunately, not long after that one of the guys showed up. He seemed surprised that the other guy was not there. I told him I needed to go. I gave him the keys, he went up to check everything, came back down and said everything was ok, and then we left.
We had the same shuttle driver as when we got to Paris. This time he seemed in a better mood though. There was some older gentleman in the front seat next to him, so they talked (in French) the whole ride to the airport.
We got checked in and waited for our flight to board. We then sat in the plane and waited for takeoff, and waited, and waited. Our flight left late...",en,books
"There is nothing wrong with wanting RW to be our QBOTF, in fact I do and would encourage you to. The problem is, starting RW this wouldn't be maximizing the teams assets.
The thought of starting RW this year is exciting and fun, but starting a rookie is always a crap shoot. Would we be stunting their development? Would we be sacrificing the season? We won't know unless we do it, but there are obvious concerns with starting a rookie.
Assuming the competition goes how most think it will, Flynn will win and give us the best chance of winning this season. Not only that, I contend if gives us the best chance of continuing to build the franchise.
Flynn starting would give RW a year of development on the sidelines and in the film room. That time is invaluable, especially with a cerebral guy like him. I don't know how long he should sit, but I think its safe to say that in the least it won't hurt him.
If Fynn proves that he is starter quality, he then becomes a valuable asset. After this season, his contract becomes very team friendly in the near term. We could hold onto him as a backup, or better yet trade him. As a true starter, with his contract, he would be a valuable asset. If we never start him, we can't prove that he is worth anything and would then most likely cut him loose eventually.
So yes, you should want Flynn to start, to help out RWs development and maximize our assets going forward.",en,unknown
"One 6/One 10
These three discs represent the first recordings (at the time of their release) of several of Cage’s later works, the so-called “number pieces”. The pieces were conceived by Cage as an analogy to the sort of anarchistic society he held as an ideal, one where individuals’ actions wouldn’t be coerced by a governing authority, but one in which the dichotomy between individual and common good would be obliterated, where social interaction would be cooperative based on generally agreed upon norms, in this case, as Cage put it, “what time it is”. So, Cage developed the idea of “time brackets”, durations within which a given performer would be required to begin and end a sequence. It’s sort of like recognizing that a job has to be done but being totally at liberty to decide exactly how to do it.
The first disc listed above, in some ways the most satisfying of the three, interweaves two works for percussion ensemble and two for large string ensembles (both achieved here through overdubbing). A feature in common to all of the pieces on the three discs is the utilization of extended tones. With the percussion works, this generally means lengthy washes of cymbals, cascades of small bells and a prominent use of ringing, flex-a-tone kinds of sounds. “Three 2”, performed by Glenn Freeman in three increasingly short portions, typifies this approach. For all its surface attractiveness, it’s a difficult thing to get a good grasp on, the sequences of percussion passing by in seemingly random stages; I had a little bit of an impression of watching particularly mellifluous cars driving slowly by, different models or colors represented by different instruments. “Twenty-Three”, for massed violins, violas and celli (Christina Fong on the first two, Karen Krummel on the latter), is a gorgeous lattice of densely layered drones occupying a very small note range but varying widely in intensity of attack. Here, as in the other string pieces on this and the second disc, Tony Conrad’s music inevitably comes to mind, but there’s nothing that remotely smacks of science experiment here (not that that’s a bad thing about some of Conrad’s work). More, there’s a surprising (for Cage) amount of palpable, human striving and emotion. In fact, I sometimes found myself hearing it as an ungodly but luscious melding of Conrad and Gavin Bryars. It also contains something of a brief coda after the 21-minute mark, a slight but lovely mood shift away from the urgency express previously, more toward an uneasy acceptance. The short “Six” (which, unlike the other pieces whose durations in minutes are indicated by their titles—read “Three 2” as “three squared”) lasts but three minutes and, not dissimilarly to the first track, consists of a series of bowed cymbals, jingle bell shakes and tympani rolls, sliding segmentally across one’s field of hearing. It a rather strong work though, with an odd, alien kind of power, as though one is observing some baffling procession of unknown purpose. “Twenty-Six” is something of a counterpart to “Twenty-Three” save that all the parts are for violin and, perhaps simply due to Fong’s persona, the emotional intensity is ratcheted up a notch or two. Again, I find myself drawing comparisons to music that one doesn’t normally associate with Cage, in this case to some of Penderecki’s writing for string orchestras from the 60s; there’s something of a similar raw, naked vibrancy. It’s a marvelous, searing performance, capping a very fine recording that should be far more widely heard than it’s likely to be.
The second disc contains “One 6” and “One 10,” performed by Fong on violin. “One 6” is a fairly harsh work, largely consisting of single, minutely varying lines held for 20-30 seconds interspersed with silent periods of similar length. In addition to Conrad, I was reminded by their austerity, of some of Lucier’s more rarefied compositions although, again, these performances are less disinterested in emotive qualities. The three movements are pitched slightly differently with a lower, grainier attack in the first contrasting with a higher, more liquid approach in the second. The third, longest movement combines aspects of both and also ups the intensity level. “One 10” is structurally similar but pitched higher still, injecting an airy, sometimes flute-like quality. One feature that holds here (and in the following disc) is that the stretches of silence are not “live” time where the performer just stops playing but are portions of dead air. This can be a little off-putting as the listener clearly loses the room ambience although, I suppose it can be argued, it thrusts you into the sound world you’re actually occupying with extra force. The astringency of these pieces sets them off against the relative lushness of “Twenty-Three” and “Twenty-Six” but provides its own unique kind of reward insofar as making you hyper-aware of your surroundings.
“Four 4” was Cage’s last work for percussion and is here presented in a massive, 72-minute performance by Freeman. Like the two pieces from the first disc, the sounds employed are of long duration: rolls, runs of bells, brushes or strokings of cymbals, etc. The major difference is the relatively extreme lengths of the silences between portions, sometimes extending for several minutes. In a sense, this is a very difficult recording to enjoy and appreciate but, I think, that’s in large part because of the demands Cage’s music places on the listener, something that, all these years after “4:33”, can still be a tough row to hoe. There’s a tension between the music played (and one’s natural instinct to listen to it for various “musical” qualities) and it’s character as an element in a sound field that equally co-exists with silence, not so much as “music” but as space occupier. In other words, it doesn’t really matter how deftly Freeman handles a given sequence (he does so, certainly), but how that sequence fits with what came before and what comes after and how much the listener distinguishes between the two, if at all. The first time I listened to “Four 4”, my wife was down the hall playing some Satie piano music at a fairly high volume, enough that it encroached on this music during quieter moments and filled the listening space during the silent stretches. For a little while, I was annoyed but soon realized how entirely appropriate this was. Whereas, by now, most of us can deal with “4:33”, I think coping with extensions of that idea, where the same notions are in effect but the space is less pristine, can cause problems. Good problems, to be sure.
These are all fine, difficult releases, performing the valuable service of continuing to challenge ideas about how one perceives music, how one perceives perception.

"|This article, HRV Armament Company, was written by Sgt.johnson. Please do not edit this fiction without the writer's permission.|
|This article, HRV Armament Company, is currently under active construction. The author, Sgt.johnson, apologizes for the inconvenience.|
HRV Armament Company, more commonly referred to in speech as HRV, is an elitist Human weapons manufacturing company headquartered on Bifröst in the Alpha Corvi System. Specializing in the creation, testing, and fielding of highly experimental and high-quality weapons systems, such as the M99C Special Application Scoped Rifle and the M100 Sniper Rifle System, HRV maintains its place through a steady supply of UNSC Military Intelligence Division contracts.
HRV Armament Company started off as a small garage-shop operation by three Marine Corps Infantry Weapons Officers: CWO5 Michael Hart, CWO5 Samuel Roberts, and CWO5 Frederick Vincent. They had all retired from the Marine Corps, and had gone into private business with each other, originally adding specialized attachments to privately owned firearms in 2432. In 2458, it merged with two aging arms manufacturers: Knights Armament Company and Kimber Manufacturing. The pair were attempting to escape the ever-looming maw of Misriah Armory, which was about to become the UNSC's primary arms, vehicle, and equipment manufacturing company. Soon after the merger, the new company changed its name to HRV Armament Company, hoping to present a more ""UNSC-friendly"" image.
HRV was under the threat of being gobbled up by Misriah until 2460, when UNSC Naval Special Warfare set out a series of requirements for a new combat rifle, and they had specifically requested that the smaller company create it. Design work began in late-2460, but the technological skills and equipment needed in the weapon were absent from HRV’s skill set. This changed in 2467 when Ohana Prescient Systems was enveloped by HRV. The necessary Fire Control System and electrical wiring needed to operate the airburst rounds and the grenade launcher were completed in short order, and the M29 Individual Combat Weapon System was delivered in small quantities in 2473. Due to their fantastic work on the weapon, the UNSC Military Intelligence Division requested that HRV create a new sniper rifle for Naval Special Warfare units, and HRV gladly accepted.
After the triumph of what would be called the M99, HRV continued its unwavering research into advanced weapons; however, they took a massive hit to their profits when all orders for the M99 were cancelled in 2521. They continued their work in different sections, acquiring the fledgling Trinity Defense Solutions to protect HRV manufacturing and research facilities. After a series of sustained recruiting efforts that mainly targeted veterans of the Human Civil War, Trinity Defense Solutions soon became a full-fledged private military company, receiving contracts to protect UEG dignitaries on several colony worlds. Ohana continued their research into advanced fire control systems, and HRV’s firearms manufacturing division received the contract to create the BR55 Battle Rifle in 2522. This new weapon would become their most successful product, having numerous descendants, including the BR55HB SR and the BR55 Designated Marksman Rifle.
Although they continued to produce the BR55 well into the Human-Covenant War, the quantities of weapons that were requested could not be matched by the company, and HRV sold the designs to Misriah under contract – HRV would receive sixty percent of the profits on each rifle sold. During the Battle of Earth, HRV’s headquarters, manufacturing, and research facilities were destroyed with a thermonuclear explosive under Directive 0-2. After the Human-Covenant War, HRV relocated to new facilities on Bifröst, and was tapped to create the M99C Special Application Scoped Rifle, following the disaster that was the M99B, produced by Misriah. During this period, Zachary Lewinski, the CEO of HRV was taken hostage by David Tam, a disgruntled UNSC Marine. Lewinski was released following extensive negotiations by SPARTAN-091, and would later step down as chief executive officer.
Despite the setbacks and challenges, HRV Armament Company has solidified its place in the defense industry, forming several partnerships with several companies. Acumen Science Laboratories and HRV Armament Company collaborated on the AS series of weapons under UNSC Office of Naval Intelligence special contract. HRV Armament Company would also find a friendly rival and ally in Jennings & Rall, a multinational conglomerate based out of the United Republic of North America. The duo and their subsidiaries would collaborate on several high-priority weapons projects that included weapons and fire control systems for vehicles.
Trinity Defense Solutions
Trinity Defense Solutions (not affiliated with Trinity Arms) was founded in 2523 by a former UNSC Naval Special Warfare operator, who had served with honor and valor during Operation: TREBUCHET before he was injured by an insurrectionist improvised explosive device. It was almost purchased by Ravenwood Solutions until hit was bought by the growing HRV Armament Company. Even though it fields less than three-hundred contractors, it has received a number of contracts from Unified Earth Government officials and diplomats, acting as escorts in hot spots around the Orion Arm of the Milky Way, as well as guarding HRV facilities and high-priority personnel. Many of its contractors are former NAVSPECWAR operators and Orbital Drop Shock Troopers, who left the UNSC due to issues with their pay or medical disabilities, and continue to provide excellence and professionalism in the field.
Ohana Technologies (formerly known as Ohana Prescient Systems) was founded in 2447 by a retired UNSC Navy Lieutenant Commander who specialized in data and computer systems during his time in service. When he retired in 2445, he set up a small technology firm in Toronto, which gained several important contracts from the UNSC Defense Force, usually fire control systems for vehicles and artillery systems. It merged with HRV Armament Company in 2467, becoming HRV’s in-house technology division. They would become notorious for the creation of the ATLAS+ System for use with the M99 SASR, as well as the supplemental ARGUS detection system and its accompanying drone. They had a minor setback in 2552 when their underground research facility was destroyed under Directive 0-2, but they resumed their work in their new facilities on Bifrost, and created the Hyperion Precision Targeting System for use with the new M99C SASR. Ohana Prescient Systems merged with Atwood Technologies in 2570, and was renamed ""Ohana Technologies"".
- The HRV name survived after intense negotiations, when the new conglomerate decided to make the company more ""UNSC oriented"", due to the fact that HRV was founded by former UNSC Marines. Despite this, the company kept the logo of the Knights Armament Company.
- Ohana is a Hawaiian word meaning ""family"".
- Prescient means foreknowledge of events, divine omniscience, and human anticipation of the course of events.

"Heaven help us: Top 10 religion movies in the '80s
Happy Easter, '80s Nation! Truth be told, the '80s were not the golden age for movies about religion. Sure, there were some classics -- did you really think Chariots of Fire was just about the Olympics? -- but for the most part, I doubt you own many of these on DVD. Even the funniest ones -- Wholly Moses, History of the World -- can't match the firepower of Life of Brian or Dogma.
Still, we persevered to produce this list of the Top 10 Movies about Religion in the '80s -- six really quality flicks ... and four that pack more punchlines than prayers.
10. HEAVEN HELP US (1985): Donald Sutherland, Andrew McCarthy and John Heard. ""We all come to the order, full of ideas... and we often find that we have much to learn ourselves.""
9. WHOLLY MOSES (1980): Dudley Moore, Laraine Newman and James Coco. ""Hey everyone. My husband is going to do God now. He just met him. He's doing God.""
8. AGNES OF GOD (1985): Jane Fonda, Anne Bancroft and Meg Tilly. ""My dear, I don't think a Communion wafer has the recommended daily allowance of anything.""
7. AU REVOIR, LES ENFANTS (1987): Gaspard Manesse, Raphael Fejtö and Francine Racette. ""Stop acting so pious. There's a war going on, kid.""
4. YENTL (1983): Barbra Streisand, Amy Irving and Mandy Patinkin. ""If we don't have to hide my studying from God, then why from the neighbors?"" ... ""Because I trust God will understand. I'm not so sure about the neighbors.""
3. THE LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST (1988): Willem Dafoe, Harvey Keitel and Barbara Hershey. ""It is accomplished!""
2. THE CHOSEN (1981): Maximilian Schell, Rod Steiger and Robby Benson. ""There is a story in the Talmud about a king who had a son who went astray. The son was told, 'Return to your father.' The son replied that he could not. The king then sent a messenger to the son with the message... 'Come back to me as far as you can, and I will meet you the rest of the way.""
1. CHARIOTS OF FIRE (1981): Ben Cross, Ian Charleson and Nicholas Farrel. ""God made countries, God makes kings, and the rules by which they govern. And those rules say that the Sabbath is His. And I for one intend to keep it that way.""",en,web
"Microsoft agreed to pay RealNetworks $761 million to settle an antitrust suit accusing the world's largest software maker of using its dominance to promote its own media player, the companies said on Tuesday.
The settlement comes close to closing an era of legal battles.
""We're reaching a point where the legal issues from the 1990s are behind us,"" said Brad Smith,
Microsoft's general counsel.
RealNetWorks had sued its longtime rival nearly two years ago, saying that Microsoft's decision to
bundle Windows Media Player for free within the Windows operating system was to blame for slower
sales at RealNetworks.
RealNetworks, founded by Rob Glaser, a former protege of Bill Gates before he left to start his
own company, built its business on its RealPlayer software for playing video and audio on
computers. Faced with stiff competition from Microsoft's competing Windows Media Player,
RealNetworks has shifted its business toward providing music and games online.
The deal ""goes beyond the settlement,"" Gates said, adding that the agreement to cross-promote
technology and services between the two companies will help them in the music market.
RealNetworks' suit was one of the last remaining major lawsuits against Microsoft stemming from
its landmark antitrust case with the U.S. government, which was settled in 2002. Since then, the
Redmond, Washington, company has reached agreements with several U.S. states and other companies.
In July, Microsoft agreed to pay $775 million to International Business Machines Corp. in a
discriminatory pricing settlement. Last year, it agreed to pay Sun Microsystems Inc. $2 billion.
It reached a $750 million settlement with Time Warner Inc. in 2003.
Microsoft will pay RealNetworks $460 million in cash up front to resolve all damage claims and the
remaining $301 million will used to promote RealNetworks' Rhapsody service on Microsoft's MSN Web
site. RealNetworks will also get licenses and commitments that give it long-term access to Windows
Media technologies to enhance the RealPlayer software.
Asked about the fate of the RealPlayer, which competed against Microsoft and became a key part of
Microsoft's antitrust challenges in the U.S. and Europe, Glaser said: ""RealPlayer continues to be
a competing product.""
In this deal, Rhapsody effectively becomes MSN's music subscription service, complementing its own
download service. Rhapsody has won kudos from analysts and some fans, but the dominant player in
online music remains Apple's iTunes.
RealNetworks' general counsel Bob Kimball said that the cash payout will give the company a
""granite foundation"" and ""flexibility"" to grow its business, but declined to say whether the money
would be used for potential acquisitions.
In demonstrations at a press conference, Microsoft chairman Bill Gates and RealNetworks chief
executive Rob Glaser showed how Rhapsody could be included in Microsoft services such as MSN
Search and MSN Messenger, its instant messenger service.
The deal could also have implications for Google, which bundles its search toolbar with the
RealNetworks is also withdrawing from pending antitrust cases against Microsoft in Europe and
Microsoft is challenging a 2004 decision by the European Commission which found that it violated
the law by competing unfairly.",en,web

Reflections on the realities of a trip to paradise
My wife and I recently took a vacation trip to the South Pacific. We visited Tahiti, Fiji and the Cook Island of Rarotonga. As a tourist, it was like spending time in a postcard: crystal clear water, bats with a 5-foot wingspan, sharks, birds of incredible color, and the nicest, friendliest people I have ever met.
Like almost everywhere in the world, there are two realities. The tourists are in heaven; the local population is trying to pay their bills, raise their kids and save for retirement. If you think our life is challenging, you should try theirs.
Tourism is to Tahiti what auto manufacturing is to Michigan. So, you think Michigan’s government is dysfunctional? Tahiti has a representative government that is so corrupt, people just accept the situation as normal. If you are unhappy with Michigan’s fractious politics, at least it can be changed. We haven’t given up yet.
Tahiti is a series of islands. Papeete, the biggest city, is like Detroit on a tropical island. The other islands are the big attraction, so ferry service is a critical part of the infrastructure. We left for the island Moorea from a rather drab, inefficient mooring at a nondescript pier. Next to that pier is an impressive modern facility that is not being used. The man responsible for running the current facility explained that the new facility is three years behind schedule and so far over budget that no one knows when it will open.
Fiji is another interesting situation. The military took over when it appeared that the Indian population was about to win a majority in the parliament even though they are only 40 percent of the population. The majority of the population is native Fijan, but they do not participate in politics with the same vigor as the minority population.
I asked about drug use because I did not see any anti-drug posters. The cab driver explained that with a military government, you do not want to be caught bringing in drugs. Due process is only a concept here. If the government does not want drugs, it can do what it needs to do to prevent them. The problem is, that applies to everything.
I asked about small business opportunities in Fiji. This was really interesting. The foundations of small business are education, availability of capital and culture. Fiji has a problem with all three.
The people we talked to all accepted the basic premise that education was critical. We were only there for four days, so I may not have this exactly correct. Parents have a major cost if they want their child to have a good education. The kids we saw going to school were dressed in uniforms. Public education is mandatory from age 5 to 14. I did not have time to delve deeper into the parents concerns. My wife wanted to enjoy the beaches and markets. Bummer. Anyway, apparently a quality education is at a premium.
In the United States, we have been blessed with a public education system that gives every child the opportunity for a quality education. The key word is opportunity. The state of public education has eroded. You can blame the unions, parents or government. I don’t know enough to know who is at fault, but people in other parts of the world make major sacrifices for their kids’ basic education.
We are used to an income level that allows people to save for future opportunities. A shuttle driver told me he works 12 hours a day, six days a week. He must be making a killing on the overtime, right? Wrong. Fiji doesn’t have our labor laws. Employers can make their employees work as long as they want. With the limited time we had, I only had a sense that Fiji’s financial world was not particularly friendly to small business. If a 72-hour week only meets basic needs and borrowing is difficult, how does anyone get started?
One of the constant statements when we became frustrated about service was to remember we were on “Fiji time,” meaning it will get done eventually, and eventually is good enough. Culture is destiny. As a hyper Type A, I looked at these people with both envy and wonderment. They live in one of the most esthetically attractive places in the world. Maybe that’s enough.
I asked a waiter if he envied the tourists. He said, “No, next week you will be back in the cold and pressure of your world. I will still be here.” Good point.
I don’t think I could function in their culture, and I doubt if they would like mine. Success, whatever that means, is such a driving force in our culture. In their culture, the enjoyment of the day is the thing of value. I get two weeks in paradise. They live there.
Education, capital and culture. Are we losing the foundation of our economy? If we are, there are places in the world where we can see what our future holds. Poverty in paradise sucks — but not as bad as poverty in Michigan in the middle of a long winter.",en,books
"1.) How do you avoid being paranoid when reading it?!? I find the chapter ‘Problems with Islam’ to be deeply unsettling. To the point of paranoia ! I guess I have a tendency to be a bit naïve and gullible, so the chapter is quite unsettling for me. It is not made any less unsettling by the fact that there are two muslims in my study group. (Which by the way seem like really nice people).
If you think the issue is specific to Islam then I think you are missing the point—it isn’t. Don’t become a racist/islamaphobe - recognize the underlying dangers and apply them generally—not just to specific groups of people. There is a difference between pointing to a specific issue and discussing it and over generalizing from it.
If you really want to be paranoid just remember that Christians have done and STILL do equally horrible things throughout the world and Atheists have done and STILL do equally horrible things throughout the world.
And when societies do these things, they generally do them because *ISMs (as in “system, school of thought”, NOT as in “class of persons” - atheism is a class of persons who have a common position on a singular question, it is not a general school of thought) are powerful tools of manipulation.
People allow the *ISM to replace careful thought in determining their actions—they get caught up in the movement and that allows the movement to use them as tools to do horrible things, often to those who disagree with them. Every individual person needs to understand that and guard themselves against it by being aware of it).
Do NOT allow yourself to fall into demonization modes. Human beings who happen to be Muslim, or Christian, or whatever are not the problem. If their actions violate civil behavior then they need to be removed from society for our mutual protection (and if we were decent human beings, their rehabilitation). We need to remember that people who do horrible things are broken, malfunctioning human beings - but they are still human beings who deserve our respect for their personage and our help when we can give it (we unfortunately don’t know how to fix everything that is wrong with people).
Don’t be an ideologist—recognize that human behaviors are extremely complex and no one solution is going to work for all problems nor for all sets of people nor for all time. Don’t make false equivalencies. The economics of cheap, easy to produce, low-barrier to entry commodity items (where open and free markets work well) is not the same as the economics of financial instruments (which work well as private, but highly regulated markets) is not the same as the economics of health care (where a mix of highly regulated public and private controls might work better in our current environment). And in all cases, what works “best” might change as our society changes. I don’t care if everyone has a cordless laser mouse, I DO CARE if everyone has a minimum of preventative and necessary medical care. These are NOT equivalent markets and I reject any approach that says “way X is the only way to run all markets, for all time, for all situations”. This is what I dislike about libertarians—their approach works well for thousands of common items and examples and they take those as false Confirmation that “way X” is the only way that works and will work in all situations. When it comes to basic health and safety where we KNOW we can do better it is not acceptable to allow failures to kill people in ridiculous ways—the market can NEVER correct for having failed in such unacceptable and preventable ways.
Another example is that gun control works well in Japan - it would not work well in Texas in today’s world. Different cultures, different histories, different approaches are required. We need realistic, complicated, evolving approaches to solving our problems.
And also, things like Nationalism are just as bad as fundamentalist extremists. No, your country is not special. You are not special. Your country does horrible things—that is a universal. The US has *#*$#ed up so many things I cannot even imagine what they all might be—and I’m fairly sure some of the worst remain hidden secrets. Iran-contra, Panama, how we treated the Native Americans and the untold millions of them we killed, prohibition, and the on-going drug war… it’s all a nightmare of epic proportions. But it isn’t going away so we have to strive to do better. And it’s not like any other country is substantially better, and many are far worse. The US seems to be a hotbed of extreme, festering ignorance right now. People are starting to hate educated people. I think it’s largely because they are getting absolutely screwed over and their anger is misdirected at education instead of at the people who sold them out—but I could be wrong.
How do you guys handle this?
I remember that life has existed as a continuous, unbroken chain for ~4.6B years and even at our worst it will continue on well after the current homo sapien species has passed away out of even distant memory. If we do well, we might be around a little longer, or replaced by a different model, but we will eventually be gone.
I also read history and understand that in many ways, things were FAR worse in the past. People had extremely limited access to information about their world which allowed sociopaths motivated to exploit others to do so on a massive scale.
I also am motivated by my own personal death—I don’t claim to know what will happen but all the evidence I have suggests that I will simply cease to be. That means I only have THIS life to live and experience and because I have empathy for others I want our mutual journey to be a beneficial one. If it turns out I’m wrong then so be it, but I would rather live as if this was my only opportunity because it is the only one I can be certain of.
2.) The notes ! Aaarrgh, the notes ! I constantly move back and forth in the book to read the notes as I come across them. This is actually disturbing my reading experience. Are the notes of substantial importance to understand the book, or can I happily ignore them without loosing anything in the book?
It depends on how much you already know. Find a system that works for you—perhaps try skimming the notes for a chapter at a time so when you are reading you will already have the context in mind and don’t need to interrupt your reading flow.",en,books
"More than tracing the footsteps of Shaw and Yeats around Bloomsbury, spending an hour or two in conversation over a well-poured pint is a quintessential London-Irish experience. A “good” Irish pub has a certain elusive quality. It doesn’t try too hard to announce its heritage. It is a space that welcomes, warms, and nurtures good conversation.
Waxy O’Connor’s – in the heart of the West End – is a cavernous pub that still manages to feel inviting. Order your pint and Tayto crisps, then choose a spot according to your taste: nestle beside the fire in the Cottage Bar, take a pew within the gothic décor of the Church Bar, or explore the fairytale atmosphere of the Tree Room, where you can marvel beneath its massive trunks and branches.
With its mix of church architecture, painted panelled ceilings and tiled floors, Waxy O’Connor’s provides a unique and quirky setting for its loyal, lively clientele. If you’re looking for a smaller, simpler experience, try Waxy’s Little Sister, around the corner on Wardour Street. Armchairs, sofas and an open fire set the perfect tone for a quick catch-up pint or a chilled-out evening.
For something completely different, The Irish Club is an elegant members’ club that welcomes guests and non-members. Located at 2-4 Tudor Street, the 1903 building previously housed The Institute of Journalists and was later converted to barristers’ chambers. Now tastefully restored, it offers a sophisticated sanctuary from the bustle of Blackfriars.
The Club’s Jameson Bar reportedly houses the largest collection of Irish whiskeys in London. If whiskey isn’t your tipple, there’s ample choice of wines, cocktails and beers to enjoy against a backdrop of contemporary Irish art. (At the time of writing, there are more Graham Knuttels than you could shake a stick at.)
The secret of a good Irish bar lies in its atmosphere. Whether its customers are reading the papers on a still afternoon, or roaring encouragement to the Six Nations, it’s a space that remains dependable, recognisable, despite its different moods. Whatever it is, you can’t bottle it.

"The original Mapes Hotel, a grand beauty of a building near the Truckee River, was haunted for decades by an unknown spirit. After it was torn down, the same presence has been reported lingering near the ice rink on the spot of the old hotel that is set up in the winter months.
A few miles out of Virginia City is the little town of Gold Hill. This is the town where the actual gold strikes began just prior to the biggest gold and silver strike ever (called the Comstock Lode) occurred in Virginia City.
Gold Hill has its share of mines that are still under the ground. The Yellow Jacket mine, the Commons mine and all the rest are still here. Miners were killed in some of these mines due to accidents. Right behind the Gold Hill Hotel is the Yellow Jacket mine. The miners didn’t have electricity with which to do their work. They had to use candlelight. Oxygen was limited underground and the gases that emanated from under the ground combined and fires were a constant danger. Unfortunately, a fire broke out in the Yellow Jacket mine in 1873 and 37 miners were killed and were left buried at the bottom of the mine shafts behind this hotel.

The Millionaires Club
“Locals and tourists rub shoulders and swap stories at The Old Washoe Club. Originally called The Millionaires Club, it was built so that nouveau riche gentlemen might enjoy the pleasures of wealth, in comfort and style. At one time, the building was even used to store corpses when the ground was frozen too solid for digging graves.
“Three ghosts haunt The Old Washoe Club; A lovely, blonde apparition, known as the lady in blue, the specter of a scared little girl, and a grizzled prospector who occasionally cadges drinks from unsuspecting patrons. Ladies be warned, the door to the women’s room locks and unlocks itself.” – Janice Oberding, Suite 101 Article.
These stories and more are part of the Old Washoe Club. What people don’t know is that there are two totally different sites of the Old Washoe Club. There are two different “parts” to the Old Washoe Club. There is the bar and snack bar downstairs. There you will find the winding staircase. This staircase was the original front door to The Millionaires Club. This would be where respectable men turned millionaires would be greeted. Behind the scenes was where the real action took place.

"Swallows Return to Capistrano
North participants report Barn Swallows, people at Mission San Juan Capistrano

Are you leveraging the potential of volunteers within your organization? Volunteers are a wonderful asset, bringing skill sets you may not have, as well as, new perspective and practices. We share some of our experience recruiting and making the best use of volunteers.
WiserEarth would have never succeeded over the years without all the amazing volunteers that have joined our global effort and brought their best to the project. One example is the WiserEarth editors’ group, a buzzing hive of activity driven largely by volunteers, now a mainstay of the site, but this was not always so. Late last year, WiserEarth’s Chief Editor Wibowo Sulistio, contacted volunteers and interns who had worked with us in the past to co-define roles for them to serve within the community. Since that time, it has become self-sustaining and community-driven. Wiserearth Editor volunteers have assisted in e-mailing organizations, created a community newsletter, greeted newcomers, helped to keep the directory current, moderated postings, and brainstormed further ways to improve the site.
In March this year, Timonie Hood, contacted me through WiserEarth. She shared her interest in sustainable building and and her passion for learning about social media. During a subsequent call, she mentioned that she was working for the EPA in the San Francisco office and was taking a leadership program that allowed her to volunteer full-time for an organization for a period of four months. You can guess what happened next. Timonie has now been with us for three months as our social media volunteer. She not only succeeded in helping us strengthen our online social media strategy but she also discovered new tools we started using for outreach: “Volunteering at WiserEarth has really opened my eyes to global collaboration and great volunteer opportunities. I definitely plan on continuing to volunteer here after my rotation ends.”.
Those two examples are two among many stories of individuals that have made a true difference within our organization. Over the years, we have learned quite a lot. To summarize, here are a few tips that have made a huge difference for us:
- Ask for help: If you don’t ask, people will not know you need help! You can simply add a small section on your website about your needs, and spread the word through social media. Hey, did you know we are currently looking for a volunteer that can turn wireframe mockups into interactive, clickable HTML pages? Also feel free to use WiserEarth’s free job listings to get your word out.
- Clearly state your need: Define your opportunity clearly, you should then have a better sense of the skill set needed and more likely the right candidate will apply.
- Create a SMART workplan: Don’t waste your precision volunteer time. Design a mutually beneficial workplan from the start with SMART goals.
- Allow for recognition: Are you both formally and informally telling your volunteer about his/her impact on your organization? A mixture of both formal recognition (emails, lunch, meetings) and informal (notes, giving away goodies) is important.
- Take the time to appreciate: Ensure that the volunteer feels appreciated, has a satisfying experience, and feels like he/she made a contribution towards the mission of the organization as well as found opportunities for personal and knowledge growth. Much easier to do if s/he has SMART goals!
If you have any volunteer experiences you would like to share, please contact us! Or better yet, if you would like to volunteer send me an email at peggy[at]wiserearth.org.

"I’ve always thought that nothing says “I’m a twat” more than an obviously personalized car number plate. I guess the geek equivalent these days is your own custom short domain for URL shortening. Most people probably use bit.ly, goo.gl or one of the dozens of similar services that spang up to accommodate the character limit in Twitter Tweets. I’ve never liked the idea of such services, but I can see the reason Twitter doesn’t use a markup language for tweets, and that the 140 character limit is absolute, and you’re only allowed text.
I recently saw a tweet by Scott Hanselman that included a short link using the hnsl.mn domain, and I thought, ‘how can I do that?’.
First you have a short domain registered. There are lots of countries that have TLDs on the internet that they allow people to register for vanity purposes. Some countries don’t allow this, so you’ll probably never be able to get a .om (for Oman) short domain, but many others do. I’ve ‘owned’ longsteve.com since the days of 2400bps modems and if you take the vowels out of longsteve, you get lngs.tv, which was available. Some countries run their own domain registrar which you need to use for those domains. For example, if you want a .st domain, you need to pay www.nic.st. However, a .tv domain, from the Polynesian island nation of Tuvalu, can be bought from almost any registrar so I registered it with my regular hosting company.
Next I needed to look into the URL shortening service I was going to use. I could probably roll my own using some PHP, and to be honest, and if I was looking to learn a bunch of stuff about URL handling and web services and so on, I certainly would have. However, that’s not my thing at the moment, I just wanted something that would work, and bit.ly have a Pro service that is currently free, although you need to be accepted since it’s sort of still Beta. They may decide to charge for it in the future, we’ll see. Using the bit.ly Pro service, you perform some setup using your bit.ly account, and then point your domain at the primary IP address for bit.ly. Once this is all done, you continue using your normal bit.ly service, but the URLs it give you use your custom domain. All this is very neat and tidy, and it integrates with everything that already uses bit.ly (like the WordPress WP-To-Twitter plugin, the Echofon Twitter client, you name it!).
One small problem I encountered in doing all this was that in order to point your domain at bit.ly, you need to set up the DNS A Record for it. Since I used my hosting company to register, the domain was pointing at their DNS server, but the tools they offered didn’t let me update the DNS in any way, only to point the domain at new DNS servers. I contacted the support, and they were very helpful, but it turned out that I needed to have a paid hosting account with them, for the new short domain, before they would perform any DNS alterations. The paid account I currently have is for my main longsteve.com domain, and requiring a separate one for the new domain is fair enough. The cheapest paid account they offer is £20 a year, which is very reasonable, but I don’t need to pay for it in this case.
You can use a free DNS service which allows you to manage the DNS records for your domain yourself. There are several on the Internet, but I chose AppsDNS after looking at a few. FreeDNS looked very interesting, and they have a unique system that allows owners of domains to let anyone else register sub-domains under their domain for free, and use those to their own ends. So, I could have put lngs.tv on FreeDNS, and you’d be able to register (for free) whateveryoulike.lngs.tv, and use that domain yourself. I didn’t fancy doing that at the moment, but it’s an interesting service to browse around and look at the domains available for use. Back to AppsDNS, if you’re managing 3 domains or less, their service is free, and after a simple sign up, all you need to do to use them is set the DNS data you’d like for your domain. You simply uses your registrars domain setup system to point it at the DNS servers for AppsDNS. Then you can enter all sorts of DNS records and info using the AppsDNS service. It’s not for the faint of heart, but all you need for a bit.ly custom URL is to add an “A Record” pointing to the bit.ly IP address. After doing this, and confirming all the domain details in the bit.ly settings interface, everything was ready to go. It can sometimes take a day or two for DNS updates to propagate around the Internet, so don’t be worried if you’ve set everything up and bit.ly still can’t see your domain. Just wait a day and try again.
So, now whenever I use bit.ly to shorten a URL, it uses my custom lngs.tv domain in the short URL. Geeky, frivolous and it probably makes me look like a twat, but it was an interesting exercise, and I learnt a bit about DNS and Internet hosting along the way, so I’m not complaining.",en,web

Talk about a tough first assignment. Jack Wilson made his first start as a Brave Sunday against Dodgers ace Clayton Kershaw and playing at third base, where he’d played only one game in his whole career.
But he made a great smothering play on his first chance on his way to a smooth game defensively, and came up with a single off Kershaw in the seventh to key the three-run rally.
“I almost wanted to look at their third base coach and say ‘Hey, if you’ve got anything let me know,’” said Wilson, who has played 1,232 games at short, 45 at second and now two at third. “Just making sure I’m in the right spots and before the pitch is made. It ended up working out today. I was happy to be out there. We were 0-2 since I got here, so I was getting a little nervous.”

For the second year in a row, Kofi Kingston made a spectacular save during the Royal Rumble match last night (Sun., Jan. 27, 2013) in Phoenix. Check out the GIF right here. It's awesome.
In the same vein that big surprise returns has become an annual tradition in the Royal Rumble, it's becoming a tradition to have one of the entrants in said Rumble make a spectacular save to stay in the match. We saw it with John Morrison using parkour to keep himself in a couple years ago, and we saw it last year with Kofi Kingston doing a handstand and walking over to the steps without his feet ever touching the floor.
And now this year, Kofi did it again. From the fine folks at SB Nation (check out their coverage here) comes the GIF you won't stop watching. It's sped up because it look quite a while for Kofi to get to the ring from the chair:
That's amazing. Like, super crazy fun time.
What makes stuff like this so awesome is the potential for failure. That chair very well could have gotten away from Kofi and he would have fallen on his ass and been eliminated and looked ridiculously silly in the process. And this GIF would live on forever for an entirely different reason.
But he pulled it off.
What's even better is I don't believe this was originally the plan. At first, Kingston appeared as though he was actually going to attempt jumping from the announce table to the ring. Once he gauged the distance between the two, he had to improvise, at which point he asked JBL for his chair and hopped his way to the ring.
Fittingly, he was eliminated by Cody Rhodes and his Beautiful Disaster Kick about five seconds later. Still, this was great fun and now Kofi has an entire year to think about how he'll one up himself.",en,web

"THERIAULT Father Armand Francis Theriault, SVD 1928-2012 Father Armand Francis Theriault, SVD passed away on December 27, 2012 at the Divine Word Residence in Techny, Illinois. ""Father T"" as he was affectionately called was born January 21, 1928 in Cambridge, Massachusetts to Nelson Theriault and Armele Moulton-Theriault. He was preceded in death by his parents and brother Nelson, Jr.; sisters, Lorraine Lavin and Marie Cyr. He joined the Society of the Divine Word and was ordained at St. Augustine Seminary in Bay Saint Louis, Mississippi in 1955. After his ordination ""Father T"" was assigned to Indonesia. However, due to political unrest in the country at the time he was unable to fulfill his dream of being an overseas missionary. So he began his long ministry in the Southern Province of the Society of the Divine Word by being sent as associate pastor at St. Rose de Lima Church in Bay Saint Louis from 1956-1958; St. Francis Church in Yazoo City, Mississippi from 1958-1963; St. Nicholas Church in St. Louis, Missouri 1963-1964. He was vocation director for the Divine Word Missionaries from 1964-1966 and then associate pastor at St. Augustine church in New Orleans, Louisiana from 1966-1968 and then pastor from 1968 to 1976. In 1976 he returned to St. Augustine in Bay Saint Louis to serve as vocation director until 1979 when he was named rector of St. Augustine Seminary. He remained rector until 1985. He spent time in St. Martinville, Louisiana for one year and then became pastor of two churches in Delcambre, Louisiana, St. Martin de Porres and Our Lady of the Lake from 1986-1992. He then returned to St. Rose de Lima Church in Bay Saint Louis where he had begun his ministry and was pastor there from 1992-2002. In 2002 he began his retirement at St. Augustine. After Hurricane Katrina ravaged the retirement residence he moved to Techny, Illinois where he enjoyed his retirement with fellow Divine Word Missionaries. Father Theriault was in many leadership positions within the Southern Province of the Society of the Divine Word. He was Vice Provincial from 1968 to 1976. He was elected twice to serve on the Provincial Council and held important responsibilities as District Superior while in the Diocese of Lafayette. His entire ministry was marked by compassion and care for people. He was part of many ecumenical groups, a member of NAACP, and extremely proud to be a fourth degree member of the Knights of Peter Claver. He was a vocal advocate for justice and equality and spared no energy during the civil rights era. With his engaging personality ""Father T"" was well known by many. Everyone who has been touched by his life has a story to tell of this charismatic priest. He was active in youth ministry throughout his life as he was also a teacher in the Catholic schools, a coach, director of youth center, and even bus driver. Until his death he was always supportive of vocations to the priesthood and religious life. In his parish ministry he encouraged young men and women to consider a life of service in the Church. He was proud to be a member of the Society of the Divine Word . His work, personality, cheerful and outgoing nature will be sorely missed. Yet, his spirit lives on in the hearts of untold numbers of individuals far and wide. He was a legend in his own time and as Father Gus Wall, SVD said so well in his Facebook tribute to ""Father T""...""well done, Frank...well done"".

"It isn’t the bitterest of Georgia’s football rivalries. Just the oldest and most competitive.
Georgia and Auburn first played in Atlanta’s Piedmont Park in 1892. They have played 113 times since then. Auburn has won 53. Georgia has won 52. They have tied eight.
So, if Georgia were to win this year’s meeting at Auburn on Saturday, the Deep South’s oldest college-football rivalry would pull completely even at 53-53-8.
After all these games, all these years, only 56 points separate the teams. Georgia has scored 1,778 and Auburn 1,722. The average score in their meetings is 15.7-15.2.
“I think that as we go on during the week the younger guys will get a better picture of what this rivalry is and has been over the years and what it’s meant,” Auburn coach Gene Chizik said Sunday. “It’s just a great rivalry. It’s what college football is all about.”
At 113 games, the Georgia-Auburn series is older than Georgia-Georgia Tech (102 games) and Auburn-Alabama (74 games).
Georgia has won the past four meetings, the Bulldogs’ longest winning streak in the series since the 1940s. As Chizik mentioned Sunday, no current Auburn player has experienced a win over Georgia.
Over the years, it has been a curious series in that the road team has won more often than the home team. Georgia has an all-time record of 14-9-2 in games played at Auburn, while the Tigers have an 18-11 record in Athens. The series was mostly played at neutral sites from 1892 through 1958.
Another quirk in the Georgia-Auburn series in recent years is that the lower-ranked team has found disproportionate success. Neither team was ranked entering last year’s game, but the lower-ranked or unranked team has won seven of the past 13 meetings when one or both teams were ranked. As you know, Auburn will go into Saturday’s game ranked No. 2 in the nation and Georgia unranked. In the last meeting of a ranked Auburn vs. an unranked Georgia, the Bulldogs upset the No. 5 Tigers 37-15 in 2006 at Auburn.",en,reference

About: Sing the Brave Song
Sing the Brave Song is adynamic and comprehensive scrutiny of the historic relationship between Indian people, the church and vast repercussions endured by former students of Indian residential schools in Canada. Judith Ennamorato's method for reporting aboriginal traditions is absorbing and potent. From first time interviews, the reader will see through the eyes of Indian children who were culturally and geographically removed from their homes and families by force; spending as long as ten months a year in institutions where they were forbidden, under threat of corporal punishment, to speak their own language, the only language they knew.
Sing the Brave Song is published by Raven Press, 501 Main Street, Schomberg, Ontario, Canada LOG 1TO (905) 939-1027 .

"iOS 7 wants: Better App Store search usability
With iOS 6, Apple has totally changed the way search results appear in the on-device App Store app. With the old App Store search, five results were immediately visible in a list view, and you could vertically scroll or flick quickly through large amounts more. With the new iOS 6 App Store search, only one result is visible at a time, and you whether you scroll or flick, you only ever get one result more at a time. And that's not good.
If you're searching for something specific, like ""Tweetbot"", it won't mean much because the first result will likely be the right one, so you only need that first result. If you're searching for something more general, like a game made by Electronic Arts, but you can't remember the name, the degradation is severe. You're presented with 1 possibility instead of 5. That's an 80% loss in information density. Ironically, the new 16:9 aspect ration of the iPhone 5 would have allowed for even more search results in the list view, 6 in total. Instead, with the new iOS 6 App Store search, we still get 1. Only longer. That's an 83.33% loss in information density.
Worse, both cards and the way they're implemented deliberately make the search interface slower. With the old App Store list view interface, you could touch and slowly scroll through results, or flick and rapidly scroll through them. So, if you didn't remember an app's name but did vaguely remember its icon, you could quickly skim for it. Or you could quickly skim until the icon, title, or anything caught your eye. With the iOS 6 App Store's card-based search, Apple has made the physics such that no matter how slowly or quickly you scroll or flick, you can only ever get to the next result. No more fast skimming. So now, even if you know the icon or some element of the title or data you're looking for, you're forced to go through one app at a time, every time, to get there. The interface has essentially gone from walk/run to forced walk.
The new card view interface does show an app screenshot in the results, but it's arguable whether or not that additional information increases identification and discoverability or just creates extra noise to visually parse. (That likely depends on the content and context of the screenshots, but until Apple allows them to be video, they'll always be of limited value.)
To get an idea of how badly the metaphor works for search in the App Store, all we have to do is extrapolate it to Google search. Imagine typing a search term into Google and instead of a page full of web results, you got a card showing one page. Currently, if the result you needed was #17, it's on the second page. With the card interface, it would be on the 17th page.
Apple could explore metaphors like this for the fast app switcher, where webOS has shown that the visualization of content makes sense. In App Store search, it just borders on the absurd.
So how could Apple fix it? An option to toggle between new-style card view and old-style list view could be a good compromise. To avoid an extra setting or button, Apple could also simply present the list view in portrait mode and the card view in landscape mode, where at least more than one app could be seen at a time. That would also match the behavior seen in the Music app with CoverFlow.
Taking it one step further, Apple could implement the portrait interface they use for app categories and present a few horizontal list views. The first could present search results filtered by keyword relevance, the second by rating, the third by how many ""friends"" have the app, the fourth by recency of release, etc. So, for example, a search for ""Twitter"" could result in the official Twitter for iPhone app showing up first for relevancy, Tweetbot first for friends who have the app, and Flurry for most recent.
While that could add complexity, it would at least be balanced by the options presented -- ""I just want a Twitter app"" vs. ""What Twitter app are my friends using?"" vs. ""I want to try a different Twitter app, which are the newest?""
If Apple's going to use the mixed vertical and horizontally scrolling pages anyway, they might as well use it to enhance sorting.
The iOS 6 App Store did not come gently into this world. The betas were fraught with strange behavior, some of which did not get fixed prior to release. The combination of vertical and horizontal scrolling elements in the app can be quirky and off-putting to navigate. Purchased lists sometimes don't display and when they do, the scrolling and touch events are janky. Search algorithms, reportedly now using technology from Apple's Chomp acquisition, have changed repeatedly.
For an app so important to Apple, developers, and users, it's a pain, and it's something that needs some considered, usability-focused attention from Apple. And soon.",en,web
"Hope Is For The Lazy: The Challenge Of Our Dead World
Photo Credit: pol siftr
Stay up to date with the latest headlines via email.
In 2005, I preached on the ecological crisis in a sermon I titled Hope is for the Weak: The Challenge of a Broken World. Looking back, I realize that I had been far too upbeat and optimistic, probably trying too hard to be liked. Today I want to correct that.
Hence, my updated title: Hope Is for the Lazy: The Challenge of Our Dead World. Let’s start with two of the three important changes.
First, to be a hope-monger or a hope-peddler today is not just a sign of weakness but also of laziness, and sloth is one of the seven deadly sins. Don’t forget that, as good Christians, we try to avoid those.
Second, our world is not broken, it is dead. We are alive, if we choose to be, but the hierarchical systems of exploitation that structure the world in which we live -- patriarchy, capitalism, nationalism, white supremacy, and the industrial model -- all are dead. It’s not just that they cannot be reformed, but that they cannot, and should not, be revived. The death-worship at the heart of those ideologies is exhausting us and the world, and the systems are running down. That means we have to create new systems, and in that monumental task, the odds are against us. What we need is not naïve hope but whatever it is that lies beyond naiveté, beyond hope.
If this sounds depressing, blame Wendell Berry. He got me going on this. In every sermon I’ve preached at St. Andrew’s, I have quoted Berry, and I will do that extensively this morning. This is the first verse from one of his Sabbath poems:
It is hard to have hope. It is harder as you grow old,
for hope must not depend on feeling good
and there is the dream of loneliness at absolute midnight.
You also have withdrawn belief in the present reality
of the future, which surely will surprise us,
and hope is harder when it cannot come by prediction
any more than by wishing. But stop dithering.
The young ask the old to hope. What will you tell them?
Tell them at least what you say to yourself.
-- Wendell Berry, “Sabbaths 2007, VI,” in Leavings: Poems
This is what I say to myself: The systems of our world are dead. Our world is a dead world. If we are to live, we have to believe in something beyond hope.
By “beyond hope,” I’m not talking about heaven, about a magical realm beyond our material existence. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, I will continue to assume that Earth is not a waiting room. We shouldn’t distract ourselves by looking to someplace up there, somewhere above or beyond, something that we pray is just around the corner.
I’m also not talking about living in domed cities or blasting off to another planet. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, I will continue to assume that we aren’t going to invent our way out of our core problems. We are here for the duration, playing the hand we have always played, with no extra aces up our sleeve.
So, ignore the desperate claims of the religious fundamentalists and the technological fundamentalists. Their fantastic futures are based on fantasies of innocence. We have sinned. We have desecrated the places where we live. We have been guilty of weaknesses and laziness. We are not innocent. Let’s deal with it.",en,books

In five short years, Rihanna has gone from being a little known teenager from Barbados to one of the most successful female singers in the world. Ten of her singles have topped the US Billboard Hot 100 charts, she has sold over 15 million albums and her songs have been downloaded a massive 28 million times. Along the way she has won industry awards, provoked controversy with her stage outfits and videos and hit the headlines for all the wrong reasons when her then boyfriend, Chris Brown, attacked her. But there is no holding the girl back and she continues to go from strength to strength.
Robyn Rihanna Fenty was born in Barbados in February 1988 and can trace Afro-Guyanese, Barbadian and Irish descendants. She used singing to escape a home life dominated by her father’s cocaine addition and subsequent marriage problems. When she was 15, she formed a group with two of her classmates. Friends introduced the group to record producer Evan Rogers who was on holiday on the Caribbean island. He was immediately struck by Rihanna’s voice and presence and began coaching her for a career in the music industry. At just 16, Rihanna left her family in Barbados and moved to the States to live with Evans and his wife, working on demos during her school holidays. A demo tape was sent to Jay-Z at Def Jam records who immediately signed the singer to the record label.
Her debut album, “Music of the Sun” was released in August 2005 and reached number ten on the Billboard album chart. Her first single, “Pon de Replay” reached number two on the US and UK singles chart and was a recording of the track she had used on her original demo tape. The follow-up single, “If It’s Lovin’ That You Want” didn’t do so well and Rihanna went straight back into the studio to record her second album.
“A Girl Like Me” was released just seven months after her debut album and produced the number one hit single “SOS”. The music industry’s response to the album was mixed although that didn’t stop her second single, “Unfaithful” from becoming an international hit. Rihanna followed up the release of the album by touring almost continuously for the next nine months, sometimes on her own, sometimes with other artists such as the Pussycat Dolls.
She returned to recording in 2007, releasing “Good Girl Gone Bad” which was to produce a staggering eight hit singles. The style of the album changed from her earlier work to showcase more dance tracks and fewer ballad and reggae songs that had marked her previous albums. Rihanna also changed her image to adopt a more edgier bad girl look, cutting her hair short and dying it black.
“Umbrella” was the song that brought Rihanna worldwide attention. The single which featured Jay-Z topped the charts around the world, including a ten-week stint on the top of the UK singles chart. Other singles from the album including “Shut Up and Drive”, “Don’t Stop The Music” and “Hate That I Love You” also reached the top of the charts in many countries around the world. The album was re-released in June 2008 with the singles, “Take a Bow” and “Disturbia” both hitting the top spot. When her collaboration with T.I, “Live Your Life” also reached number one, Rihanna could claim five number one singles in three years. She tied places with Beyonce for the most number of singles in the decade.
In 2008, Rihanna won her first Grammy Award for “Best Rap/Sung Collaboration”. She would go on to win the same Grammy Award the following year along with Best Rap Song for “Run This Town” (a collaboration with Jay-Z and Kanye West) and in 2011, she won her fourth award for Best Dance Recording for the song “Only Girl”.
Rihanna went back on the road in 2007 with the “Good Girl Gone Bad” tour and the following spring, joined Kaye West, N.E.R.D. and Lupe Fiasco on the Glow in the Dark Tour.
She released her fourth album in November 2009. “Rated R” sold over one million copies and the first three releases from the album – “Russian Roulette”, “Hard” and “Rude Boy” – all made it into the top ten singles chart, with the latter reaching the number one stop. To promote the album, Rihanna hit the road with her “Last Girl on Earth Tour”.
“Loud”, Rihanna’s fifth album came out in November 2010 and sold over 200,000 copies in its first week of release. The first single from the album was “Only Girl (In The World)” which had been released as a download several months earlier and was a slow burner, taking many weeks to reach number one on the Billboard singles chart. In fact it was over-taken to the top spot by her second single, collaboration with rapper Drake called “What’s My Name?”. When the latter topped the UK charts in January 2011. Rihanna became the only female singer to have five number one singles on the UK charts in consecutive years. Her tenth US number one single was “S&M” that reached the top in April 2011.
In between releasing her own albums, Rihanna has collaborated with many other artists on their recordings. These include Eminem on “Love the Way You Lie” which gave Rihanna her seventh number one US single and Kanye West’s “All of the Lights”. She also tried her hand at acting, taking a role in the film “Battleship” which is due for release in 2012.
Rihanna appears as much in the gossip columns as she does on the album charts. But in February 2009, the press attention in her accelerated when she was attacked on her way to the Grammy Awards by her then boyfriend, singer Chris Brown. A photograph of Rihanna after the assault was leaked to the press, showing that she had visible injuries on her face. Brown was arrested and subsequently charged with assault and making criminal threats and was ordered to serve five years probation and to stay away from Rihanna.
Rihanna has come a long way in a very short time. From singing with her girlfriends after school to dominating the music charts, it has been a very rapid rise to the top for the singer. She continues to produce hit singles and to push the boundaries of promo videos and to collaborate with some of the best artists in the business. There is no doubt she will be around to create her special brand of music for many years to come.",en,books

"Portuguese authorities recently made a pre-emptive offer to their country’s creditors: Instead of redeeming bonds maturing in September next year, the government would stretch its repayment commitment out to October 2015. The deal was concluded on Oct. 3, and has been interpreted as a successful market test for Portugal. Ireland’s authorities have conducted similar recent operations, exchanging short-maturity paper for longer-term debt.
These transactions highlight the broader strategy of buying time. Both countries are seeking to create a longer, more manageable repayment profile for their privately held debt as they begin weaning themselves from dependence on official “bailout” funds provided by the “troika” (the European Commission, the European Central Bank (ECB) and the IMF). Private investors are acknowledging the reality that repayments will likely be drawn out, because insisting on existing terms could cause an untenable bunching of debt-service payments, with possibly unpleasant consequences.
This strategy’s success presupposes that, in the interim, economic growth will strengthen the capacity to repay debt down the line. The debt ratios for both Ireland and Portugal are expected to peak at about 120 percent of GDP next year, after which they are projected to fall. The peak ratio and the subsequent downward trajectory depend crucially on the assumed pace of economic growth.
However, growth prospects remain grim. The Portuguese economy is now expected to contract by 1 percent next year. In late June, the IMF projected modest growth, and — at the time of the “bailout” agreement in May last year — GDP next year was expected to grow by 1.25 percent.
Such successive downward forecast revisions have become commonplace. The latest estimates for Italy and Spain project a deeper contraction, prolonged into next year. Ireland is doing better, although its growth forecast has also been revised downward, to just under 0.5 percent this year and 1.4 percent next year. Moreover, Irish GNP (the income accruing to its nationals, as distinct from foreign firms operating in Ireland) continues to shrink. Each downward revision implies postponement of the date on which the debt/GDP ratio will peak.
Beyond next year, growth must depend on either the elixir of structural reforms, or a strong revival of the global economy, but a revival of economic growth in the short term is unlikely. Crucially for Europe, world trade has been virtually stagnant in recent months. Global trade and economic performance in the eurozone appear to be dragging each other down.
The potential consequences are serious. While the IMF’s primary scenario is that Irish and Portuguese debt levels will soon stop rising, it comes with a chilling litany of downside risks. The likelihood that budget deficit and debt targets will be missed is rising.
Thus, the eurozone faces three choices: Even more austerity for the heavily indebted countries; socialization of the debt across Europe; or a creative reprofiling of debt, with investors forced to accept losses sooner or later.
Austerity alone cannot do it. Some countries face the growing risk of near-perpetual belt-tightening, which would further dampen growth and thus keep debt ratios high. After all, if a country’s debt/GDP ratio is to decline without austerity, the interest rate that it pays on its debt must be lower than its GDP growth rate. If the interest rate is higher than the growth rate, austerity is required; the wider the gap, the more austerity is needed.",en,reference

You are off to a very good start. If you have no resistance and are a good pill taker (missing almost NO doses) and you continue a regimen such as the one you are on, there is optimism that the virus can be controlled for a very long time (how long-no one knows but I tell patients that we are on a 10-20 + year plan in many instances). Studies generally have been encouraging that under ideal circumstancs (as outline above) that the per year failure rate of potent regimens is low (? < 5%/year). KH

"Deschutes Brewery Pairs Award Winning Beers & Portland’s Top Chefs For Benefit
The Deschutes Brewery 2nd Annual Chef’s Challenge
On Monday, December 13th, 2010
Tickets were $75 per person and covered food, beverages and gratuity.
All benefits went to Morrison Child & Family Services.
To learn more about Morrison Child and Family Services, visit their website at www.morrisonkids.org.
We arrived at this event not really knowing what to expect but we were definitely excited to have the opportunity to check it out as we had heard some great things about the first Chef’s Challenge. Upon arrival we were lead into the bar area where they started the evening pouring a couple of Deschutes signature beers paired with some tasty appetizers.
Once we were seated, several key people from Deschutes and Morrison Child & Family Services gave an overview of the event and the charity. There was a panel of celebrity judges that would pick their favorite pairing and each attendee was given a ballet to vote for their favorite pairing. Prior to each course arriving at the tables a brewer from Deschutes would discuss the beer and then the chef of that course would discuss the entrée they had prepared.
Competing chefs included:
Adam Higgs, Acadia
Ben Dyer, Laurelhurst Market and Ate-Oh-Ate
Dave Anderson, Genoa
Jeff Usinowicz, Deschutes Brewery Portland Pub
Kurt Spak, Alba Osteria
Scott Shampine, Davis Street Tavern
The celebrity judge’s award went to Davis Street Tavern for an ox tail spuckie with duck fat baguette paired with Black Butte XXII. The People’s Choice award went to Genoa for a cotechino sausage served over braised lentils paired with Hop Henge 8.
Our favorite beers of the evening were the Benderweisse, Hop Henge 8, and the Black Butte XXII. Our favorite course, which was not on the ballot, was the dessert by Jill Ramseier of Deschutes. It had peanut butter marshmallows and dark chocolate ganache served over a molasses graham cookie and a scoop of vanilla ice cream topped with a root beer float feuilletine. This amazing concoction was paired with the Abyss. It was the perfect finale!
Kudos to Deschutes for doing an amazing job hosting this event. Each food and beer pairing was unique and made for an interesting evening of culinary bliss. To top it all off, it was all in the name of supporting a good cause! You won’t want to miss this event next year.

"Lower Saluda River - Kayak Trip / Canoe Trip
Submitted by: rtpumphrey
Well the Lower Saluda is a very nice 3 or 4 mile short trip down the river. There are rocks so you need to be aware of the water level, and the kind of material that one's canoe or kayak is made of before going on a nice day trip. There are several types of birds such as great herrings and kingfishers that live on this river.
There is a reservoir (Lake Murray) with a hydro electrical plant that is located up the river. Too, there are markers that show the dangerous to safe levels of the water at the put-in. Overall, this makes a nice trip on the river for any age of paddlers.
There are many motels and hotels that are located around Lexington and Irmo.
On the Irmo side, the put-in requires a fee to park; however, the Lexington Side is free.
Put-in: From I-20 take exit 61 towards Lexington, then follow Corley Mill Road for about 4 miles. Turning right on Hope Ferry follow the road down towards the landing.
Take-out: From I-20 Take the Bush River Exit Number 58, take the turn towards Irmo. Go for about 3 miles and take a left on Garden Valley Lane. Follow the road and take left into the Saluda Hydro Project. This is a Canoe/Kayak put-in or take-out only.

"On December 5, 1971, five men entered the Quality Motel on Main Street and forced their way into the room of Davenport Police Patrolman Leon Washington. The men hit Officer Washington and tied him up, then stole three automatic pistols, a revolver, and a shotgun. It is possible that the men also tried to rob the motel offices—in any case, an alarm went off, alerting the police.
Patrolman Sam L. Raley and his partner Patrolman Michael Farnsworth, who had joined the department in August, were among the first officers to arrive on the scene. They observed four men fleeing from the motel and tried to stop them. The suspects started shooting and the police returned fire.
Patrolman Raley was lucky—three bullets just missed him. Patrolman Farnsworth wasn’t. The twenty-nine year old man died of a gunshot wound to the head shortly after being rushed to t. Luke’s Hospital.
The police, joined by Scott County deputies and five squads from the Iowa Highway Patrol, cordoned off a two block area and searched the motel and surrounding buildings. Four suspects were arrested and charged with first degree murder.
A continuous honor guard of uniformed police officers stood at either end of the casket as more than 400 people visited Runge Mortuary to pay their respects to Michael Farnsworth, the first Davenport Police Officer to be killed in the line of duty since 1958.*
Donations for the Farnsworth family were sent to the Police station by people all over the Quad-Cities—over $800 was collected in two days. A clothing store offered to give Mrs. Farnsworth a dress for the funeral. The city paid the funeral expenses, and Davenport Memorial Park donated two burial plots to the family—a gift that was usually given only to war veterans killed in action.
The funeral, held at the First Presbyterian Church, was attended by almost 200 police officers, active and retired, from as far away as Dubuque, Iowa, and Galesburg, Illinois. All members of the Davenport Police Department and Fire Department, barring those on shift duty, were present, including Patrolman Leon Washington.
“His death in responding to the Call of duty deeply touches us all,” said Reverend Dr. Donald Blackstone. “[We must] increase out respect for, and appreciated of, and cooperation with out law enforcement officers and agencies. . . if we will seriously undertake and implement these changes, the death of Michael Farnsworth will not be in vain.”**
After the service, a double line of police officers formed and an honor guard of six officers in full dress uniform escorted the coffin as the pallbearers carried it to the hearse. One of these pallbearers was Sam Raley.
Officers stood at attention long the route to the cemetery, which led past the Police Station, its doors draped in black. Flags all over the city were flown at half mast. Once the procession reached the cemetery, officers lined the path from the hearse to the gravesite.
Davenport police officers are not often lost to us in the line of duty, though they willingly put themselves at risk for us every day. Perhaps it shouldn’t take a funeral to remember how important they are to our community?

ALABAMA----stay of impending execution
Ala. court delays scheduled execution for Grayson
The scheduled Thursday execution of Alabama death row inmate Cary Dale Grayson
has been delayed by the Alabama Supreme Court.
The Alabama Department of Corrections said the Supreme Court had stopped the
execution Monday. Officials with the Alabama Attorney General's office could
not be reached for comment on whether the state would appeal the decision. Last
month the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals stopped the scheduled execution of
death row inmate Tommy Arthur after his attorneys challenged a change that had
been made to the drugs used in Alabama executions.
Grayson was 2 of 4 teenagers convicted for the 1994 torture and murder of Vicki
Lynn DeBlieux, who was hitchhiking on Interstate 59. She was beaten and her
body was thrown off a cliff and later mutilated.

Inmate charged with capital murder undergoes mental testing
Witnesses gave expert testimony Monday at the Atkins hearing for a St. Clair
Correctional Facility inmate charged with two counts of capital murder.
3 witnesses testified before St. Clair County Circuit Court Judge Phil Seay
regarding the mental status of Taurus Carroll, 34, and additional testimony
will resume at 9 a.m. today.
Carroll is charged with the Sept. 14, 2009, capital murder of Michael Turner,
24, who was serving a 3-year sentence from Montgomery County for robbery and
conspiracy to commit robbery.
St. Clair County District Attorney Richard Minor said any criminal defendant in
Alabama who alleges they are mentally retarded must have an Atkins hearing to
determine whether or not they are eligible for the death penalty.
Minor said the Code of Alabama defines mental retardation as “a person with
significant sub-average general intellectual functioning resulting in or
associated with concurrent impairments in adaptive behavior and manifested
during the developmental period.”
Minor said to meet that definition, the defendant first must show significant
sub-average intellectual functioning—an IQ of 70 or below. 2nd, the defendant
must show significant or substantial deficits in adaptive behavior. 3rd, those
problems must have manifested themselves during the developmental period,
before age 18. In order to be classified as mentally retarded under Atkins in
Alabama, all 3 of those criteria must be met.
Minor said an individual found by the court to be mentally retarded cannot
receive a sentence of death under U.S. and Alabama law.
Susan Wardell, a mitigation specialist, testified as an expert about the social
history she compiled based on records and interviews with Carroll and members
of his family.
“I met with Taurus Carroll for 5 hours face-to-face,” she said. “I interviewed
9 family members, all older, many who lived with him and were able to provide a
view of Taurus from an adult standpoint.”
Wardell said she learned from Carroll that he had great difficulty in school,
that his mother was an alcoholic who drank while she was pregnant with him,
that he grew up without a father figure and that he was abused.
“Any of these risk factors in a person’s life, none of which he has control
over, create a toxic environment,” she said.
Wardell said adaptive behavior is the activities of daily living, whether you
have the skills to care for yourself, such as cooking a meal or figuring out
which bus to take to reach a destination.
Wardell testified she believes Carroll has significant deficit in adaptive
functioning behavior, and that it manifested prior to age 18.
Minor asked Wardell if she did not want to see Carroll receive the death
“No, I don’t want to see him get the death penalty, but I’m not going to lie,”
she said. “I do this so the jury can know about the whole person.”
Wardell testified Carroll could show goal-oriented behavior, but that based on
testimony of family members he was always a follower and never a leader.
She said her research and interviews were indicative of someone who has mild
Dr. Robert Shaffer, a clinical psychologist who testified as an expert in
clinical psychology, said Carroll’s recent IQ test resulted in an IQ of 71 and
that a 70-75 range is the maximum range eligible to qualify for Atkins due to a
five-point margin of error with the test.
Shaffer testified he performed a number of neuropsychological tests on Carroll,
but did not reissue an IQ test due to the practice effect where individuals
score better every time they take a test.
Shaffer testified that the Flynn effect, which accounts for the gradual
increase in average intelligence in the general population of about 0.3 IQ
points per year after a test is standardized, would decrease Carroll’s IQ test
score by 1.5 points, because Carroll took the IQ test five years after it was
“An IQ score of 69.5 gives the true measurement of comparison,” he said.
Shaffer testified that in his opinion, Carroll consistently falls in the range
of mildly mentally retarded and that it manifested prior to age 18.
Defense attorneys Dennis Rushing and Don Hamlin rested their case, and the
state called its 1st witness, Dr. Susan Ford, director of Psychological &
Behavioral Services for the Alabama Department of Mental Health.
Ford, who testified as an expert on mental retardation, said she administered
an oral test that differs from an IQ test in that the comparison group for the
oral test is people who have mental retardation.
“The average scores of this test are not average of the general population,”
Ford said if a person scores average on the test, it indicates that person is
“In the 10 domains (each of which is scored either extremely low, below
average, average, above average or superior), he scored superior in 5 and above
average in 5,” she said. “No scores warrant a mental retardation
Ford said during the test, she asked Carroll follow-up questions to verify the
levels of abilities he claimed to have.
“He held a job in the prison kitchen or bakery,” she said. “He used a big mixer
in the kitchen and explained how to turn it on and what ingredients he used to
make biscuits. A lot of times people won’t lie, but they will feel they can do
more than they really can. I wanted to make sure I didn’t ask him just yes or
Ford testified most mentally retarded people she knew would be unable to pass a
GED, which Carroll failed the 1st time and passed the second time.
“A mentally retarded person might pass some parts of it (the GED) orally, but
it requires a higher learning to pass the whole test,” she said.
Ford said although Carroll indicated he was in learning disability reading
classes in school, he attended regular classes in math.
“Mentally retarded people tend to function equally across the board,” she said.
“But someone with a learning disability would have highs and lows in different
areas. And on a GED or IQ test, they might score lower than they are actually
capable. Someone who is brilliant might have a learning disability.”
Ford testified the Flynn effect is not recommended by the American
Psychological Association, and that the margin of error with the IQ test could
mean Carroll functions at a level higher than the 71 score.
Carroll is currently serving life without the possibility of parole stemming
from a 1998 capital murder conviction in Jefferson County.
He was removed from the general inmate population in September 2009 after
Turner was stabbed to death.
According to the first count of the indictment Carroll “did intentionally cause
the death of Michael Darrell Turner by stabbing him with a prison made knife,”
and that Carroll caused that death after having been convicted of another
murder within the last 20 years.
The 2nd count of the indictment, also for capital murder, stated Carroll
intentionally caused Turner’s death while under the sentence of life in prison.

Taft murder case is rare capital trial
It has been 2 years since a murder that shocked Raleigh; a seemingly random
beating of a state school board member.
Monday, jury selection began in the trial of Jason Williford. Police say he
raped and killed 62-year-old Kathy Taft as she was recovering from surgery at a
friend's house in Raleigh in March of 2010.
One of the big breaks in the case, was a DNA link between a cigarette at the
scene and Williford. His attorneys unsuccessfully tried to get that piece of
evidence thrown out.
The murder of Taft lingers in the minds of family and friends like Pat Dunn, a
former Greenville mayor who knew Taft well.
""Whether it's the death penalty or life in prison without parole, this is what
you don't want this person to be out on the street ever with the opportunity to
do this again,"" said Dunn.
The quest for justice includes the possibility of the death penalty. For the
1st time in 2 years in Wake County, there will be a capital murder trial.
Wake County District Attorney Colin Willoughby said the state is going for
capital punishment because of ""the brutality and the fact that someone was in
their home and were randomly selected for violence.""
He knows it's a tough and expensive fight.
""It takes a tremendous commitment of resources on the defense and prosecutors
side,"" Willoughby said. ""We try to be selective and look at only those few
cases that we think really warrant this type of commitment of resources.""
Though people might think that the death penalty would save taxpayer dollars by
taking the criminals out of the prison system, a two-year study out of Duke
University found the opposite was true. Death penalty cases actually cost a lot
more public money.
""I found that the extra cost to the taxpayers was about $11 million a year,""
said Philip Cook, a professor of public policy and economics. His research
looked at more than a thousand murder cases, and found extra costs in death
penalty cases. For example, the suspect gets two state-appointed lawyers
instead of one.
Cook said, ""There are extra costs at every step along the way.""
He says jury selections and trials take longer. And despite the extra costs, a
death sentence is rarely the outcome.
""I found of every 25 cases that were selected by the DA for capital
prosecution, only one resulted in a death sentence,"" said Cook. Death penalty
convicts also have more chances to appeal.
North Carolina's last execution was a man named Samuel Flippen, who was
convicted in Forsyth County (which includes Winston-Salem). He was put to death
by lethal injection on Aug. 18, 2006.

Faith Leaders Want Mercy For Ohio Death Row Inmate
More than 200 religious leaders are asking Ohio Gov. John Kasich to spare a man
scheduled for execution next week for fatally stabbing a 15-year-old boy during
a farmhouse burglary.
Ohioans to Stop Executions and People of Faith Against the Death Penalty say
they submitted a Monday letter to Kasich on behalf of about 230 faith leaders.
They ask that the sentence of 49-year-old Mark Wiles be commuted to life in
prison without parole.

actions in the 1985 slaying in Portage County.

Guilty plea expected in threat case----Ex-death-row inmate accused of
retaliating against Putnam Co. judge
Former Ohio death-row inmate Kenneth Richey is to plead guilty Friday to a
charge related to threatening a Putnam County judge who was a prosecutor on the
1986 case that landed him on death row.
Richey, 47, of Tupelo, Miss., is expected to enter a guilty plea to an
unspecified felony that could land him in prison for ""no more than"" 3 years,
said Todd Schroeder, an assistant Putnam County prosecutor. Sentencing is set
for May 7.
Richey was indicted in January by a Putnam County grand jury on charges of
retaliation and violating a protection order. Authorities say he left a
threatening message for Judge Randall Basinger on the clerk of court's
answering machine on New Year's Eve. Both charges are third-degree felonies
that carry a possible penalty of 6 months to 3 years in prison.
Mr. Schroeder said he did not want to release details of the proposed plea
agreement with Richey. ""Things can change,"" he said. ""If Mr. Richey were to
change his mind, I don't want to suggest to the public what he may have been
willing to acknowledge.""
Gregory Meyers, an attorney with the Ohio Public Defender's Office who is
representing Richey, could not be reached for comment.
Richey was convicted in 1987 of setting a fire at a Columbus Grove, Ohio,
apartment that killed 2-year-old Cynthia Collins. He was sentenced to death,
but in 2008 -- after 2 decades on death row -- a federal appeals court
overturned Richey's conviction because of problems with the arson evidence that
led to his conviction.
The court ordered a new trial in Putnam County, but Richey pleaded no contest
and was convicted of attempted involuntary manslaughter, child endangerment,
and breaking and entering. He was sentenced to 21 years in prison, given credit
for time served, and released.
As part of Richey's 2008 sentence, a civil protection order was imposed that
prohibited him from contacting Judge Basinger and 20 other individuals
associated with his case. Richey, who had been diagnosed with anti-social
personality disorder, had made repeated threats over the years, including a
threat to ""cut the throat"" of Judge Basinger, who was an assistant county
prosecutor when the case began in 1986.
In the most recent charges that brought him back to Putnam County, Richey
allegedly left a message for Judge Basinger saying, ""I am in Ohio. I'm coming
to get you.""
The 2008 protection order was to remain in effect for five years ""or until Jan.
7, 2013"" unless modified or dismissed by the court. Mr. Schroeder declined to
say if he would ask for the protection order to be extended but said the order
would ""be included in our discussion on Friday.""
Richey, a dual U.S. and Scottish citizen who returned for a time to his native
Scotland in 2008, is being held in the Putnam County jail.

Relatives of victims happy to see David Alan Gore’s execution day is almost
With the long-awaited execution of serial killer David Alan Gore now just 2
days away, the reality of what’s about to take place is sinking in for those
making the trip to Starke.
Jeanne Elliott says her stress level has gone up considerably since Feb. 28,
the day Gov. Rick Scott signed Gore’s death warrant.
That’s not the case with her ex-husband, Carl Elliott.
“The closer it gets, the better I feel,” he said.
Their 17-year-old daughter, Lynn Elliott, was the last of Gore and cousin Fred
Waterfield’s 6 murder victims. Gore shot her to death on July 26, 1983.
Almost 29 years later, the moment Carl and Jeanne — now 81 and 69, respectively
— have been waiting for is now in sight. They both plan on being in the front
row for Thursday’s execution. They want to see Gore, who will be strapped on a
gurney, carted into the execution chamber and given the lethal injection. Once
that happens, he should be pronounced dead within 10 minutes.
The state gave potential witnesses to the execution a DVD to watch, preparing
them for what might happen Thursday. They were warned, for example, Gore may
make a final statement — or he might not.
“The (DVD) sort of prepared you emotionally,” Carl said.
Carl and Jeanne will be joined in the execution viewing area by several
relatives and a close friend.
Their son, Jason Elliott, has not decided whether he will witness the
execution. He will give his uncles and cousins 1st opportunity, should seating
Jason, who lives in Orlando, will drive his parents to Starke.
“I’m looking forward to it for my parents,” he said. “It’s great that it’s
happening, but more so for them.”
Lee Martin also plans to witness the execution. She is the mother of Regan
Martin, who was abducted with Lynn Elliott but survived the ordeal.
Regan Martin, now 43, is married with two kids and living in Georgia. “I know
that I am not going to witness the execution. I really don’t want to see his
face again,” Regan Martin said. “My husband will be going in my place and of
course my mother will be there.
“There are a lot of people from my past that I would like to see — to support
some and to let others know that I am OK and doing well, but I also value my
privacy. I may go and stay in the background, in the waiting area. I’m not sure
Gore and Waterfield killed 4 girls and 2 women in the early 1980s.
Gore was sentenced to death for the Elliott murder. Waterfield is serving life
without parole at the Okeechobee Correctional Institution for the deaths of 2
14-year-old girls, Barbara Ann Byer and Angel LaVallee.
Members of both the Byer and LaVallee families plan to witness the execution.
“I just think I should be there,” said Barbara Ann’s father, Mike Byer, who
lives in North Carolina. “We really owe it to (Barbara Ann) to see it through.”

When: 6 p.m. Thursday
Where: Florida State Prison in Starke
Why: Sentenced to death in 1984 for the 1st-degree murder of Lynn Elliott
Mike said he made the decision to attend after reading “The Serial Killer
Whisperer.” Pete Earley’s book — which includes graphic letters from Gore — was
published in January.
“The book just kind of made me sick,” he said.
Nancy Byer will join her husband of 46 years as a witness.
“I want to see it finalized — done with,” she said. “This execution needs to
happen. It needs to happen for so many people. … We’re all left with this
Gerri LaVallee says she often thinks of her late husband, Dick, and the
stepdaughter she never knew (Angel).
“He and Angel are constantly with me,” she said. “I wake up at night thinking
Her husband was never the same after Angel was killed, she said. He died in
1997 at age 57.
“My husband should be by my side for this,” she said.
It’s a shame Gore has outlived some family members of the victims.
For Judy Kay Daley, who was Gore’s 3rd victim, Hildie Tripson is planning to
witness Gore’s execution.Hildie’s husband, Mark, is a cousin to Mike Daley,
Judy Kay’s husband.
“I don’t know how it works in heaven, but I feel comfortable doing this for
Kay,” Hildie said.
Some people against the death penalty asked Hildie why she would want to be a
She tells them: “Don’t you think Kay was against dying the way she died? She
didn’t have a choice at that moment.”
Mike Daley, who lives in California, said he will be unable to make another
cross-country trip to attend the execution. He and his brother were in Florida
just last month.
“I don’t need to be there,” he said. “He’ll be just as dead when it’s over.”
Meanwhile, Barbara Ann Byer’s father, Mike, isn’t a death penalty advocate by
any means, but he believes executing Gore is the right thing to do.
“It’s just something that needs to be done,” he said. “I don’t take pleasure in
it. It’s just something that needs to be done.”
Will the execution bring closure to the victims’ families?
Jeanne Elliott described it this way:
“I don’t know if you’d say it’s closure, but it’s a weight that comes off you.”
A tremendous weight, for sure.

Detective Details Work in 1981 Slayings As Killer Awaits Death Penalty----Tom
White still frustrated by case of condemned David Alan Gore
Detective Tom White knew David Alan Gore was a killer well before he murdered
his 4th, 5th and 6th victims. He just had a hard time proving it.
But he came close — frustratingly close.
White was with the Indian River County Sheriff's Office when Judy Kay Daley
disappeared in July 1981. Gore, who is set to be executed Thursday for
murdering his final victim, soon became his prime suspect. He later suspected
Gore was tied to the disappearance of a Taiwanese woman and her daughter, and
his gut told him their bodies were buried in the orange grove where Gore
worked. He spent a week digging before giving up.
More than 2 years later, after Gore was arrested for killing 17-year-old Lynn
Elliott, Gore took authorities to the same spot. White watched while 2 drums
containing chopped-up body parts were unearthed just feet from where he stopped
digging. Now, almost 29 years later, White's voice is still tinged with
frustration as he thinks about how close he came to solving 3 slayings before
Gore went on to kill 3 other girls.
""They were like 5 or 6 feet away, inside the drums,"" White said about the
remains of 17-year-old Ying Hua Ling and her mother, 48-year-old Hsiang Huang
Ling, who disappeared in February 1981. ""I couldn't believe it.""
White, now 67 and a former Vero Beach mayor, grimaced and shook his head,
searching for the words to describe how he felt when his instincts proved
""I just … I totally … I, I was just so … If I just went …,"" White stopped and
started. ""If I just did this. If I just went over a little bit more.""
He let out a big sigh.
White kept his eye on Gore, or at least tried to, after he began investigating
the disappearance of Daley, a 35-year-old woman visiting from California. She
disappeared from Round Island Beach, where someone had disabled the car she was
using. Someone called Daley's relatives and said she was having car trouble and
wouldn't be able to pick up her teenage daughters from another beach about 15
White received a tip that Gore was seen at Round Island Beach that afternoon.
""So I checked with David and said, ‘What were you doing around Round Island?'
He said, ‘I was going to check the tides. I wanted to see what the tide was
doing.' I said, ‘You work in a grove,'?"" White recalled.
Then he received another tip that Gore was at a pay phone with blood on his
shirt about the same time Daley's relatives received the call about her car
""David became my prime suspect. Because now this became too much of a
coincidence,"" White said.
The shirt had been washed, so the blood evidence was gone, but investigators
found two hairs in a bracket holding a two-way radio in Gore's truck. White
called Daley's husband in California, and he shipped White his wife's
hairbrush. Daley's hair matched the two strands found in Gore's vehicle.
""I took that to the assistant state attorney and they said, ‘Without a body and
without more evidence, we're not issuing a warrant for David,"" White said.
White remained convinced Gore was responsible, but the man got a lawyer and
stopped talking to investigators.
Bob Stone, who was the state attorney at the time, remembered Gore's being a
""Everybody that I talked to in law enforcement, they thought he did it,"" Stone
said. ""No way to prove it.""
Gore was arrested days later after he was found in the backseat of a Vero Beach
police officer's wife's car. He was shirtless and had a cocktail in one hand
and a gun in the other. He also had handcuffs, rope and a police scanner. Gore
was sentenced to 5 years in prison, though he was paroled and served only about
1½ years. White tried talking to him about the Daley case while he was in
prison, but he refused.
So White interviewed Gore's wife. She told him they got into a fight earlier
that year when the family dog pulled two bras that weren't hers out of the back
of his truck. Gore drove her to the orange grove, started up a backhoe, put the
shovel onto the ground and stopped. He sat there for a while, then shut the
machine off and drove her home.
""It gave me the impression that because his wife saw the bras, he was thinking
in the back of his mind, that he was going to kill his wife. And she's
convinced of that, too, that he was going to kill her that day and put her in
the ground. And for some reason, he changed his mind,"" White said, adding that
the bras she described sounded like the sizes the Lings would have worn.
He thought there were bodies in the grove, so he and another officer, along
with inmates from the county jail, dug a trench 6 feet deep and about 100 feet
long. They found nothing. But even after Gore was released from prison, he
remained under White's surveillance.
""I just had a feeling that he was going to do it again,"" White said.
However, Gore's mother complained to then-Gov. Bob Graham's office, and a
supervisor told White to leave Gore alone.
White said he argued: ""You know he's guilty. We've got to find out - he's going
to slip up.""
""No. You're ordered to stay away,"" White was told.
A message left on Graham's cellphone asking to talk about the case wasn't
Again, White's instincts proved correct. Shortly after being released from
prison, Gore kidnapped, raped and murdered 14-year-old Orlando girls Barbara
Ann Byer and Angelica Lavallee in May 1983. Then in July, he kidnapped and
raped Elliott and her 14-year-old friend.
Elliott tried to escape, running naked from Gore's parents' house with her
hands tied behind her back. Gore ran naked after her and shot her dead in the
driveway. A boy riding his bike witnessed the killing and went home and told
his mother, who called 911. Gore was captured and the 14-year-old rescued. Gore
ultimately admitted to and was convicted of all 6 murders.

Mortgage insurer United Guaranty Corp. promoted Brian Gould to the position of chief operating officer. Gould joined the...
Freddie Mac will allow mortgage servicers to apply federal taxpayer dollars to reduce principal or pay past due balances for struggling borrowers in all states that have designed such programs.
""Effective immediately, (servicers) should participate in state (housing finance agency) modification assistance programs that permit (servicers) to apply funds as a partial principal curtailment for homeowners with Freddie Mac-owned or guaranteed mortgages,"" according to an alert sent to servicers late Monday.
State housing finance agencies in California, Nevada, Michigan, Arizona, Rhode Island and Ohio put money from the $7.6 billion Treasury Department Hardest Hit Fund toward eligible borrower principal. This reduces their loan-to-value ratio and could qualify them for various modification or refinancing programs.
A Freddie Mac spokesman said servicers are cleared to participate in all state Hardest Hit Fund states that do not require matching amounts by the servicer or investors. The modification structure the reduction is linked to must also conform with Freddie programs as well. The Michigan program, for example, grants up to $10,000 in reductions, but the program currently requires the servicer to match, which Freddie would not allow.
Just $217.4 million of the Hardest Hit Funds available were spent as of the end of last year, according to the latest data from the Special Inspector General of the Troubled Asset Relief Program.
Much of the delay is caused by a lack of participation by the government-sponsored enterprises. Before the guidance released Monday, both GSEs prohibited principal reductions on mortgages backing the bonds they issue and will continue to forbid write downs outside of these programs. Because the Hardest Hit Fund programs are voluntary, servicers did not participate when such large portions of their portfolios – those owned by the GSEs – could not be applied.
In July, the Federal Housing Finance Agency rejected an offer from the Treasury to pay for a portion of principal reduced under a Home Affordable Modication Program workout.
Some of the restrictions, though, began to thaw earlier in the year. Both GSEs allowed servicers to participate in a Hardest Hit Fund principal reduction program in California after the state HFA dropped the requirement for banks to match any taxpayer-funded write-downs. It also cleared participation in a similar Nevada program that provided up to $50,000 in reductions.
A Fannie Mae spokesman did not immediately say if it was expanding its servicer participation as well.
Going forward, Freddie servicers must recalculate monthly mortgage payments for borrowers who were still current on their loan when receiving the newly available assistance. Mortgage servicers are prohibited from adjusting the interest rate or loan term when recalculating the monthly payment after the principal is reduced.
If a borrower was delinquent or already received some principal forbearance, the Hardest Hit Fund money must first go toward paying off the past due monthly payments, with the remaining funds applied to curtail principal, according to Freddie.
When the write-down is done in tandem with a modification, Freddie said the borrower must first complete a three-month trial period before the taxpayer money can be applied to any arrears or fees. Remaining money can then be applied to reducing the principal.
After the HFA funds are applied, servicers can then recalculate final modification terms, Freddie said.

"Last summer was the largest free agency for the NBA. Of these free agents, one of the most crucial was Lebron James. During a televised interview with Jim Gray, Lebron announced he was joining Dwayne Wade, Chris Bosh and the Miami Heat to compete for a NBA title. Naturally this announcement caused an uproar. Of course I expected major backlash from the home town fans of Cleveland. (I didn’t expect the burning jerseys though.) But I was shocked by the fact that several people were also disgusted by him choosing to leave the Cavs…and many were non-Cleveland residents or non-basketball fans. I heard different statements thrown around like, “Oh, Lebron isn’t a leader since he chose to leave,” “It was no longer ‘his’ team” and “MJ wouldn’t have done that.” ESPN even asked MJ himself if that would have been a decision he would have opted for.
In business, we try to attract the most intelligent, creative, hardworking individuals to heighten our chances of increasing the bottom line. How is this any different than what Lebron did? Can you name one NBA team that didn’t have at least two All-stars or really great players? The Bulls had the Big Three (MJ, Pippen, Rodman) long before the current Celtics. In addition, I don’t remember a huge negative response when Kevin Garnett and Ray Allen joined Paul Pierce. In any formalized group, there’s usually a leader or “go-to” person that the team leans on for guidance. There wouldn’t be titles for Jordan or Kobe without teammates who knew their roles and were able to deliver when duty called, e.g. the Bulls’ John Paxson and Steve Kerr or the Lakers’ Derek Fisher and Pau Gasol.
My point? Creating a spectacular team will do wonders for your organization. I highly recommend that you do everything humanly possible to attract the best talent as long as it’s ethical and legal. Nobody said, “Hey Larry Page, Google’s not your business because Sergey Brin created it with you.” Everyone just respects the company for the tech juggernaut it has become.
I can’t predict what will happen in the 2011 playoffs with the new and improved Heat team, but there are two things that are certain: 1) the Heat will be exciting to watch and 2) creating the best team you can conjure up can help increase your chances of succeeding than you doing it all on your own. Sure, creating an all-star cast can be tricky with egos, expectations, etc. But if everyone is bringing a unique skill to the table and co exists, the opportunities from the collaboration are infinite.
What are your thoughts about the Heat trade? Was it good business?

"Nine years ago Mark Richards persuaded the editor of his local paper to let him write a weekly column. This meant six hundred words every week about the humorous side of family life from a Dad’s point of view. Here Mark, who has recently published a book, Best Dad I Can Be, talks about how he’s kept it up for so long and offers some tips on how other bloggers can keep going…
BY MARK RICHARDS
It was 2003. The word ‘blog’ had barely been coined but in effect that’s what I’d started – a weekly blog about my family. More 450 weeks and 300,000 words later the column is still going strong – and now it’s a blog as well, at www.bestdadicanbe.com
During the nine years my children have moved from nativity plays and party bags to teenage angst, slamming doors and boyfriends that I’m fortunately not told about. This week the curly haired little boy who was nine when I started writing goes to university.
During that time I’ve written my column every single week. Number of deadlines missed: nil. So with an ever-increasing number of people wanting to blog about their families, how have I done that? How have I made sure that there has always been something to write about?
Here are half a dozen tips based on the techniques I’ve developed over the years to make sure that I’ve never missed my deadline.
1. Make a commitment. Whether it’s to an editor, your readers or simply to yourself, make a commitment to write your blog consistently. Producing something every week is hard. Inevitably you’ll have a crisis when you can’t think of anything to say – but force yourself to write through it, and you’ll soon find that the idea of missing a week becomes unthinkable.
2. Find the time of day that suits you. Sorry to sound like an article from ‘Motivation Today’ or ‘Business Week’ but after commitment comes discipline. Part of this is finding the time of day that suits you and using it to write. Early morning seems to suit me and at the weekend I follow a simple routine: get up, feed animals, make tea, start writing.
3. Never, ever, let an idea escape. Trust me, over time you will become better and better at recognising ideas and incidents that could turn into a blog post, but when you have an idea or a flash of inspiration don’t let it escape. I know of no worse feeling than sitting at my laptop thinking ‘what the hell was that brilliant idea I had this morning?’ Dictate it into your phone, run to your computer and write a few words, even (and how retro is this?) make a note in a notebook. But never, ever let a good idea escape you.
4. Work on more than one blog at once. I’ve just checked and I currently have about ten ‘Best Dad’ columns/blogs at various stages from a few lines to 500 words. Some of these will never make it to publication – the idea simply won’t be strong enough to sustain 600 words. Others will be merged to make one column. I don’t have a specific ‘editorial calendar’ but having several columns on the go at once suits the way I work.
5. Don’t expect perfection the first time. When Rory McIlroy steps on to the tee he’s not expecting to get the ball in the hole. He’s simply aiming to hit it down the middle of the fairway and get it a lot closer to the hole. I take the same approach to writing. I don’t sit at my laptop expecting to finish a column at the first attempt. If I can write 200 words, that’s fine. 300 is better and 500 is brilliant, but more often than not I’m happy just to move the ball nearer the hole. So don’t say, ‘there’s no point writing because I don’t have an hour to finish my blog.’ We’re talking families here – sometimes ten minutes is all you’ve got. Get your idea down. Get the first 200 words written. Starting a blog is 50% of the way to finishing it.
6. Finally, learn to listen. Your children are wiser and funnier than you think. Really listen to what they’re saying and you’ll have more ideas than you can cope with. Teenage sarcasm is a particularly rich seam to mine. “What do you think if this?” I asked my daughter in Next, holding up what I considered to be a rather stylish striped shirt.
“I’m sorry, Dad,” she said, “There are dead people with more fashion sense than you.”
Writing about my family is just about the most rewarding thing I’ve ever done. If you want to do the same, make a start now. You’ll leave your children an absolutely unique record of their childhood: one they could never get from any number of photos or videos – and one they’ll be able to turn to when they’re struggling with their own children…
You can read Mark Richards’ blog about his family at www.bestdadicanbe.com The first book in the ‘Best Dad’ series is now available on the Kindle. When he’s not writing Mark is talking about writing or helping companies tell their story, and showing them how to speak to their clients in simple English. He also coaches people who want to have a successful blog and ghost-writes blogs for businesses and individuals. He can be contacted via email@example.com

"Sedgwick County commissioners on Wednesday will consider a transportation service agreement with the City of Wichita that involves subsidies to AirTran and Frontier.
In August, commissioners approved a new contract with AirTran, granting a one-year subsidy of up to $6.5 million for the airline. The state covered $5 million of that through a grant, with the county and city splitting the difference.
In addition, the county has a revenue guarantee with Frontier to pay up to $500,000 a year. Read More",en,web
"Wall Sconces: A Tradition of Romantic Lighting Sconce lights can create an artistic expression of light and mood. There is no end to the decorating possibilities when using this lighting option. Wall Sconces lights can accent any and almost all color choices and design styles. The surrounding colors will positively glow from the beautiful light that sconces give out. The mood is definitely a romantic one as the stage is set for a warm and inviting space, especially if combined with a warmer paint color and decor. The contour of the warm inviting glow is the best to illuminate a dark corridor or staircase at night or to create an elegant mood as it gently reflects the colors around it.
Historical Sconces Sconce lighting is not a new concept at all. They have been in existence since the early part of the 1600's. The older versions produced illumination through the use of candles and oils. The outer materials were created from various wood, metal, and stones available for the time. As technology advanced through the years, so did the sconces. Today, there are many options not only for the outer appearance of the light but also for the bulb used inside the sconce.
The Best Areas for Wall Sconces lights The right space to apply sconce lighting is the area that will best allow the light to flow freely. This might be a hallway or any space that allows the glow to move about the space unrestricted. The contour of the warm inviting glow is the best way to illuminate a dark corridor or staircase at night, or to create an elegant mood as it gently reflects the colors around it. Sconces can be placed in areas where other forms of traditional lighting just do not work well. If you find a lack of floor space is an issue, a wall sconce is a good replacement. They can even be used as an outdoor lighting source giving an ambiance of comfortable serenity to the surrounding area.
A large selection of wall sconces are available from contemporary transitional to traditional. Buy from brands like Terzani, Artemide, Ultralights, Leucos, Eurofase, Forecast, Tech Lighting and more.",en,web
"♔ New covers! Oh my gosh this is such a long post and I'm sorry but I've missed so many weeks of gorgeous new covers and I couldn't stand not having them here. Seriously though, I don't know if I can handle so much prettiness. I'm surprised that a lot of them are continuation of series instead of the usual new books. Oh, how my heart broke when I heard there would be a new cover for Shatter Me. I LOVED the old one, and I usually grow attached to first versions... The rest are still gorgeous, of course -creepy eye aside-. My favorite one is, without a doubt, the one of Let the Sky Fall.
♔ The actress for the role of The Mortal Instrument's Isabelle Lightwood has been casted! Her name is Jemima West. Yay, more new actors announced! I'm actually excited for this movie and I'm eager to get to know the rest of the characters. It's interesting and I can't help but compare them to how I see them in my mind.
♔ Teaser images of Obsidian's book trailer! Quite an intense scene... I've read somewhere that it's the ""laptop scene"". I haven't read the book, so I don't really know! It has me a little bit puzzled that they're releasing the book trailer now, but oh well, I'll be looking forward to it :)
♔ The title of the third book of the Bloodlines series has been revealed! It'll be The Indigo Spell (I like how it sounds!). And there's even the first paragraph as a teaser! I don't know how, but with just that I'm dying to read the book. And just today I started The Golden Lily.
This wasn’t the first time I’d been pulled out of bed for a crucial mission. It was, however, the first time I’d been subjected to such a personal line of questioning.
“Are you a virgin?”
♔ Book trailers! Very late, I know ;; But there's the Tiger Lily one! I honestly can't wait for the book to come out, I think it'll be one of those books that will blow me away. Expecting some major awesomeness! :)",en,web
"Setting the Course: Committee Organization
Improving the quality of education is directly related to the degree of involvement, participation, and commitment by advisory committees. The energy and actions of instructors, administrators, and advisory committee members are critical to the effectiveness and success of the committee.
Successful advisory committees develop and implement a written plan each year that reflects consensus on the need and requirements of each program. With that plan established, advisory committees maximize their effectiveness by focusing on the activities that will result in change and improvement.
It is important that members:
- Attend and participate in all meetings.
- Suggest and develop agenda items prior to meetings.
- Help determine committee goals and objectives and ways to achieve them.
- Become familiar with the educational system and how professional-technical education fits into the overall educational structure.
- Respect the rights and opinions of other committee members.
- Accept committee responsibilities.
- Avoid conflicts of interest.
Most advisory committees have at least ten members including employers, employees, faculty, staff and administrators. Some committees may meet two or three times a year to carry out one or two activities, while others may meet more often and carry out a variety of committee activities. This is determined largely by the scope of the committee’s program of work.
A term of membership is decided by each committee in accordance with existing college policy. A three-year term is suggested with reappointment as an option. Systematic replacement is usually established with consideration given to staggered terms. The benefit of having one-third of the members change each year is that it provides new ideas and smooth operation for the committee.",en,reference
"Correctly identifying what is causing a problem is the most important step in pest control. We do our best here to help you do that. Sometimes we can identify the cause accurately enough from your phone or e-mail description of what is happening and what you see. Sometimes we can do this from photographs you submit, either electronically or printed on paper. But sometimes word descriptions and photographs aren't quite good enough, and we ask you to submit a specimen of an arthropod you have found, or the damage it has caused.
The information we give you is only as good as the information you give to us. I can't identify specimens that look like the one in the photograph above. Here are some hints that will help all of us:
1. Make sure any photographs are CLEAR and take several, from very close up to farther away. Make sure you have sufficient light, or that you compensate with your camera to make sure we can clearly see what you are trying to show us. Learn how to use the close up mode on your digital camera.
2. You have 20,000 of something flying around? Please give us at least - oh maybe - six of them. If it's something unusual, we need at least one full, intact set of key characteristics. If there are big individuals and little ones, try to submit a few of each size. Maybe they're different, maybe they're not, but we won't know for sure unless we see them.
3. Label your material. Where and when was it found? What does it seem to be doing?
4. You had 20,000 last week, but you can't find even one now? Maybe you don't have the problem anymore. Keep an eye on the situation and try not to worry.
5. That doesn't go for termites. If you think you had a termite swarm, worry! Keep a close eye on it, try to find a least one, even if it's only a wing, and submit it for identification.
6. You can kill most small pests by putting them in the freezer or by dropping them into alcohol. Any sort of alcohol will do. The alcohol not only kills them, it also preserves them. Never submit arthropod specimens in water (unless they are living aquatic animals). Moths and butterflies are easier to identify if they are not preserved in alcohol, so just freeze them and bring them in dry. We can also take live specimens.
7. Some insects and mites are most easily submitted on or in a piece of the plant they are living on. It's best if the sample is as fresh as possible. Don't bake it in a hot car.
8. A few creatures can't be identified from the sample you submit. Ants are most easily identified from the workers (the ones without the wings). Some spiders can only be identified to species if you have adults of both sexes. Small larvae, nymphs and eggs can be extremely difficult to identify. That's just the way it is.
9. Entomologists specialize. Sometimes we have to send things off. If they only have to go to the university, turn-around time can be quick. If they have to go further, it may be a long time before you hear back. This doesn't happen that often, though.",en,reference

"The wine business continues to do things no one expects, and the latest Champagne sales numbers are a striking indication of what’s going’s on.
This French wine service story is stunning in its conclusions: “Champagne was dominant 10 to 15 years ago, but the world has changed.”
The story, though written for the European market, is well worth reading because it documents the trend we’re been talking about here for several years (and not just because I’m trying to put together The Cheap Wine Book). Today, when consumers have a choice between two quality products, they’re more likely than ever to buy on price. Champagne exports declined 2.8 percent last year, while non-Champagne sparkling wine accounts for 70 percent of the European market.
In other words, we’re buying more cava and prosecco and so are the Europeans -- and that it’s not Champagne doesn’t seem to bother us.This is shocking news, and especially for the Europeans. Their market never, ever worked that way.
This also demonstrates the continuing evolution of the wine market into two tiers – everyday wine drinkers, who are mostly ignored by the Winestream Media, and a much smaller, score-driven minority that still buys wine the old-fashioned way and is doted on by most of the wine world.
And how cheap are these wines? Cava costs €8 (US$11) or less in most European retailers, while prosecco ranges from €5 to €15 (about US$7-$20). Those of you who buy either in the States will note that’s pretty much what we pay for it. Call it the pricing power of the biggest multi-national wine companies (cava giant Freixenet’s annual production is about two-thirds of the entire Champagne region), and they’re more than willing to trade margin for market share – another theme we’ve discussed in detail here.",en,web
"Modest swimwear has a pretty bad rap, especially online. Many a blogger without a topic to write about has, from time to time, relied on various ""modest"" contraptions to entertain his online audience. And frankly, one can see why: there is the swimsuit which resembles a beekeeper uniform, then the frightful housedress-and-wetsuit ensemble which, to me, evokes thoughts of polygamy more than going swimming--the list goes on and on. (My secret belief is that these atrocious ensembles are actually contrived by people trying to make modesty look bad, but of course this is difficult to confirm.)
I have been reluctant to step into the fray, primarily because if one so much as mentions modest clothing nowadays, one is always accused of ""telling people what to wear."" (Curiously, it doesn't work the other way 'round with those promoting revealing clothing, but that is a topic for another day.) Additionally, standards of external modesty differ, so instead of endorsing any particular clothing I have tried to focus my efforts on helping young people make better choices in their relationships in general.
And yet, the majority of newcomers to this blog have alighted here after searching for modest bathing suits--or so I am told. Therefore I feel obliged to report on the new generation of modest activewear, the kind which will not cause you to flee in fear.
Over the summer I have been conducting an informal contest of sorts, and the good news is that we have some winners. Modest activewear has come a long way since the ""Little House on the Prairie"" days. (Not that there's anything wrong with that.)
The first item I tried out, which shall remain nameless to spare its creator any embarrassment, was a sort of culottes made from light grey nylon. The idea is great--a split skirt that resembles a skirt while walking, but when exercising, gives you the freedom of pants. As you may know, the original long split skirts were developed in the Victorian Era for horseback riding so that women could sit astride a saddle rather than having to ride side-saddle. Alas, this modern culottes adaptation, being made of nylon and Lycra, doesn't quite work in the execution: although the crotch seam is dropped considerably, it doesn't resemble a skirt (or pants, or really anything at all for that matter). The overall effect is what you might expect when a bunch of unflattering, stretchy material folds over in lumps, creases and rolls--and it is all attached to you. I knew something was wrong when my husband told me, ""It looks fine, darling--as long as you stay on the bike. Just whatever you do, don't get off the bike.""
This was his subtle, super-nice way of signaling that this was not his favorite outfit. Needless to say, I moved on. Just because you have your counter-cultural tendencies doesn't mean you want to look like Weird Modest Girl. Or, for that matter, Ali Baba.
But then I discovered HydroChic. HydroChic sells a whole line of capris, swimshirts, and skirts that are meant to be worn without a bathing suit underneath. At left is one of their super-comfortable swim outfits (specifically, Seabreeze Sporty Stripe 3/4 Sleeve Swim Surf Top paired with Long Water Skirt/Attached Pants for coverage--comes with a sportswear swim-bra as well). I swam in it at the cottage, I wore it bike riding, and--this was truly the test--it held up while I was chasing after four little boys at the water park. I felt comfortable during all these activities, primarily because the high-quality stretch spandex/nylon combo dried off very quickly, but also because I didn't have to worry about sunscreen except for my face (the garment has a SPF of 50+). Best of all, with its fitted skirt and concealed nylon swim leggings, it really looks great. This was definitely one of my favorites this summer (although, no, that is not me in the picture).
Now, I know some people searching for modest bathing suits are simply in the market for a cute retro one-piece à la ReVamp; then there are others who wouldn't consider the above outfit modest enough. I'm not here to judge. But if you're looking for something with a slightly longer skirt (HydroChic's longest just grazes the bottom of the knee) then Modiwear, maker of the blue suit at left, sells a bunch of different modest swim-and-activewear combos which hit well below the knee. Batsheva Asbell, the founder of Modiwear, sat down with me in her Toronto home and shared her journey to creating alternative swimwear that ""focused on the person rather than the body"":
""I was inspired by my experience at a separated women's beach in Ashdod [Israel]. The women were mostly from Jerusalem and wore robes and oversized T-shirts over their bathing suits. They couldn’t swim very well and although they were just thrilled to be in the water, they spent most of their time pulling their coverings down. In addition, I had heard a story of a woman in Florida who lost her life because her wet robe overtook her ability to keep herself from being pulled under. My conscience was hit and I felt obligated to make a difference. I call it a 'Modisuit' because it is flexible for an array of activities, and it included a world of women who were concerned not only about modesty, but also, those concerned about any medical issue.""
Although Modiwear's skirt is longer, it also features the stretch spandex/nylon skirt over thin leggings--a winning combination. Batsheva told me that a lot of women are wearing her suits ""to go to the waterpark, then go to a restaurant, and then go home."" I suppose it depends on how fancy the restaurant is, but the garment does dry quickly, so you needn't put other clothing over something wet, nor change at all after swimming, necessarily--certainly a huge advantage when managing young children. Modiwear also makes children's suits which are adorable. (They don't have a website yet but you can email their office to find out more, or to place your orders here: email@example.com.)
But personally, I think it's well worth it. How many times have you heard women using modesty as an excuse not to get out there and get active? If the Gibson girls could do it in the 1900s, then now so can you.",en,web

"We should expand the Supreme Court. I am serious. We should add another 100 justices. Tack an addition onto the building in Washington.
I suggest this because of the way we now go about selecting justices. We select them on the basis of sex and race. And then we pat ourselves on the back. And we tell each other our court is now more “representative” and more “inclusive.”
More representative and inclusive of what? Well, of Hispanics. And African-Americans. And women.
This seems to me to be a highly prejudiced way to select justices. Justice is supposed to be blind. But, hey, what do I know? People who know about these things tell me we just have to have a Hispanic judge. And one or two African-Americans. And some women. And I say “Go for it.”
But I also have to ask about the Asians. We’ve got lots of Asian-Americans. We’ve got lots of Native Americans. How come these folks don’t get included when “inclusion” comes around? We’ve got lots of Protestants. How come they don’t get represented when our court becomes more “representative”? (I may be wrong, but I believe there are no Protestants on the bench.) And don’t get me started on illegal immigrants. Who represents them?
How about us left-handed folks? Does anybody think about us when they go searching for justices? I am deadly serious. Left-handed folks suffer a lot of problems because of the way they are. They suffer more accidents with equipment. That’s because tools and equipment are all designed for right-handed people. There is a whole lot of prejudice going on. And nobody does anything about it. Probably because they give us the back of the hand – the right hand – when they go searching for justices.
Incidentally, there is a lot of prejudice against left-handed people in some professions. When is the last time you saw a left-handed catcher in the major leagues? How about a left-handed third baseman? You could list all the left-handed violinists on the back of a postage stamp.
How about gay folks? Why don’t we find some gay judges to work down at the Supreme Court? And let’s hire some disabled people for the court. People confined to wheel chairs. People who have debilitating diseases. Surely they number in the millions. Don’t they deserve justices who are similarly disabled? Wouldn’t such justices be more likely to understand issues disabled Americans are sensitive to?
How about tall people? And short people? You know it will be a frosty night in Hades when we have a dwarf on the bench. Tell me that isn’t prejudice.
Our justices are nearly all graduates of Yale and Harvard. And I believe none of them have experience in the armed forces. Sounds like prejudice to me.
It seems to me that the only way we can be truly “inclusive” is to expand the court. Hey, we’re expanding other branches of government like topsy. It won’t cost much to add a bunch of justices. Robes are cheap.
Let’s list all the significant categories Americans fall into. Include all the races and colors and sexual preferences. (Let’s hear it for the cross-dressers!) Then appoint at least one justice from each of the categories.
It wouldn’t be any more ridiculous than what we do now.

"Anatomy & Cell Biology
I was born in Manhattan, Kansas, where my father is a scientist who heads the Wheat Genetics Resource Center at Kansas State University. Growing up, I had only a very nebulous concept of what was entailed in scientific conferences that my father attended - mostly they were a black box labeled ""Science Talk."" As I got more into biology and research I had a clearer concept that new knowledge must be constantly disseminated. When I attended my first scientific conferenece - the 44th Annual Midwest Regional Developmental Biology Meeting, at the Stowers Institute for Medical Research - I was struck by the real sense of community that existed among the researchers and the high level of discussion that took place after the talks, not to mention in the hallway or over dinner. I realized that the scientific community was a living, growing and changing group with enlivened and passionate discussion.
In 2005, I graduated from the University of Kansas with a BA in French Language and Literature and a BS in Biology. Early on at KU, I was able to study Western Civilization, European History and Art History for a semester split between Paris and Florence, and this helped my decision to follow French as a major. I spent the last two and half years at KU in what proved to be the most important experience of my undergraduate education - learning and doing molecular neuroscience research with Dr. Erik Lundquist. The lab was interested in parsing the complex parallel and redundant molecular pathways needed for axons to find their targets.
Since the summer of 2005 and until entering the Kansas MD/PhD Program in 2007, I was a full time Research Assistant in the Developmental Genetics Program at Skirball Institute of Biomolecular Mediciine at the NYU School of Medicine. Dr. Jeremy Nance was the PI on the grant to characterize genes regulating the embryonic cell movements of gastrulation. We were interested in how cells in the early embryo first develop apical-basal polarity, and we used the model of the nematode C. elegans.
Away from classes and the lab, I enjoy the piano, improving my German proficiency, both of which I started while in New York for two years. I also spend four years on the KU Ultimate Frisbee Club that was a lifetime opportunity that I cherish to this day as a unified effort that led to qualification for the national tournament in Seattle.

sue likes blue
Another one off the ""in progress"" list. I'm down to 17! Woo-hoo!
This quilt is made up of all solids. I LOVE solids so much. This is probably one of the final versions of this quilt that I will make. I've already made it in orange, green and aqua. I've made variations of it in orange and grey, too. IF I were to make another version of this, I think I'd do it up in reds and browns to match my living room. It doesn't sound like I'm ready to be done with this design yet, does it? :)
This is the back. I love to make two sided quilts. It gives me a good excuse not to label it, because I'd hate to ""ruin"" one side.
To quilt it, I did an all over swirl quilting pattern. Liz and I were discussing this quilting method and we both agree that it is a much easier and more natural technique than stippling. For those of you who have a hard time with stippling, you may want to give it a try. It also seems to me that swirly quilting goes a lot faster than stippling, which is handy when you have 17 WIP's. :)
The quilt measures about 55"" x 70"".
About the name of this quilt....when we moved into our house, it was apparent that the previous woman of the house (Sue) liked blue. A lot. We have 2 blue bathrooms, HAD a blue kitchen, and a blue basement. Oh, and our master bedroom has blue carpet, too. So, ""Sue likes blue"" is a phase I've uttered a lot over the past few years. And will probably continue to do so for a long time to come. I like blue, too, but not quite that much. It makes a fun quilt name, though, and that's what really matters, right?",en,unknown

"#GROW Week Day 4: a photo wrap up
An issue that we face in telling stories from around the world is language. One of the ways of getting around that barrier, and bring stories to life, is through pictures. Over the last couple of days we’ve had some fantastic images that show how amazing Oxfam’s work can be. Here are some of my favourites:
In Burkino Faso they’re talking to university students about GROW issues and one of the ways they’re doing this is with a photo exhibition. I love the images they’ve got – the picture at the top of the page is from there.
Throughout the week I’ve been highlighting some of the great stuff going on the Philippines. But this picture, of a female farmer is amazing (sorry I don’t have more details to share)
In Belgium, Oxfam has been taking to the streets and protesting outside of the meetings of the European Seed Association. The Association is lobbying for more control over how seeds are bought and sold – this would be bad news for the small-scale farmers that we work with.
And in Azerbaijan a strawberry farming project is changing rural women’s lives.

"Israeli government ""justifies"" torture with national security
Six days after Arafat Jaradat was arrested by the Israeli army and the Shin Bet (Israeli intelligence agency), he was dead. Between the day of his arrest, February 18th, and the day of his death, February 23rd, his lawyer, Kamil Sabbagh, met with Arafat only once: before a military judge, the Kishon interrogation center of the Shin Bet.
Sabbagh said that when saw Jaradt, he was terrified and had said he was in extreme pain after being beaten and forced to sit in stress positions with his hands tied behind him.
When they announced the death of Arafat, the Israeli Prison Service said the Palestinian, who leaves a widow and two children, died of cardiac arrest. However, the autopsy did not find any subsequent blood clot in his heart. In fact, the autopsy concluded that Arafat, who turned 30 years old this year, had enjoyed good cardiovascular health.
The final exam found that, in fact, the cause of death was that Arafat had been beaten with repeated blows against his chest and body, and had a total of six broken bones in the spine, arms and legs, his lips were lacerated and his face severely injured.
The class of injuries sustained by Arafat before he died at the hands of the Israeli Shin Bet is common to many Palestinians who pass through Israeli prisons. According to the Addameer organization for prisoners' rights, since 1967, a total of 72 Palestinians were killed as a result of torture and 53 due to medical negligence. Less than a month before the death of Jaradat, Ashraf Abu Dhra died while in the custody of Israel, in a case that the organization considers the direct result of medical malpractice.
The legal impunity of the Shin Bet and its torture techniques have been well established. Between 2001 and 2011, 700 Palestinians sent complaints to the State Attorney's Office, but none were criminally investigated.
Writing for the publication Adalah, in 2012, entitled ""On Torture,"" Bana-Shoughry Badarne, lawyer and legal director of the Public Committee Against Torture in Israel, wrote that ""the impunity of GSS [Shin Bet] is absolute.""
The Supreme Court of Israel has been extravagantly useful in ensuring the imperviousness of Shin Bet to accountability in relation to international law, thus allowing widespread and lethal torture.
In August 2012, the Israeli Supreme Court rejected the petition submitted by the Israeli human rights organization, Adalah, the Association for Civil Rights in Israel to demand that the Israeli Attorney, Yehuda Weinstein, conduct criminal investigations of every allegation of torture by the Shin Bet.
In the first week of February, two weeks before the death of Arafat, the Supreme Court threw out a petition by Adalah demanding video and audio recordings of all Shin Bet interrogations, to meet requirements of the UN Convention against Torture (UNCAT, in English), to which Israel is a signatory.
In May 2009, the UNCAT condemned Israel for not performing the requirement of recording interrogations conducted by the Shin Bet, and stressed that such monitoring is essential as a preventive measure to inhibit torture.
However, in 2012, the Knesset (Israeli parliament) extended the Shin Bet exemption from the requirement to record interrogations for three more years.
Rationalizing about the failure to meet this requirement as basic, recording interrogations, the State maintains that the claim is for the protection of ""national security"" interests that interrogation techniques that are not made public.
Arafat was killed under torture. Torture is routine. But the following is not routine, from the announcement of the death of Arafat, thousands of Palestinians have joined in solidarity with the arduous struggle of Palestinian prisoners on hunger strike, responding with force.
At least 3,000 prisoners refused to feed themselves; thousands took to the streets of Gaza and vigorous demonstrations took place throughout the West Bank. While the State of Israel continues to launch its arsenal of lethal weapons to repress the Palestinians, the banality of evil this regime is and will always be eclipsed by the powerful will of the Palestinians for self-determination.

Stringobjects indispensable and string handling within a program easy.
String class lies towards one end of a spectrum in terms of complexity in a class.
String class is intended to be usable in any program. It includes facilities and
capabilities for operating on
String objects to cover virtually all circumstances in
which you are likely to use strings. In most cases your own classes won't need to be this elaborate.
You will typically be defining a class to suit your particular application. A very simple class for
Plane or a
Person, may well represent objects that can potentially
be very complicated, if that fulfils your needs. A
Person object might just contain a
name, address, and phone number for example if you are just implementing an address book. In another
context, in a payroll program perhaps, you might need to represent a
Person with a whole
host of properties, such as age, marital status, length of service, job code, pay rate, and so on. It
all depends on what you intend to do with objects of your class.
In essence a class definition is very simple. There are just two kinds of things that you can include in a class definition:
These are variables that store data items that typically differentiate one object of the class from another. They are also referred to as data members of a class.
These define the operations you can perform for the class--so they determine what you can do to, or with, objects of the class. Methods typically operate on the fields--the variables of the class.
The fields in a class definition can be of any of the basic types, or they can be references to objects of any class type, including the one that you are defining.
The methods in a class definition are named, self-contained blocks of code that typically operate
on the variables that appear in the class definition. Note though, that this doesn't necessarily have
to be the case, as you might have guessed from the
main() methods we have written in all
our examples up to now.
Variables in a Class Definition
An object of a class is also referred to as an instance of that class. When you create an object, the object will contain all the variables that were included in the class definition. However, the variables in a class definition are not all the same--there are two kinds.
One kind of variable in a class is associated with each object uniquely--each instance of the class
will have its own copy of each of these variables, with its own value assigned. These differentiate one
object from another, giving an object its individuality--the particular name, address, and telephone
number in a given
Person object for instance. These are referred to as
The other kind of class variable is associated with the class, and is shared by all objects of the
class. There is only one copy of each of these kinds of variables no matter how many class objects are
created, and they exist even if no objects of the class have been created. This kind of variable is
referred to as a class variable because the variable belongs to the class, not to any particular
object, although as we have said, all objects of the class will share it. These variables are also
referred to as static fields because, as we will see, you use the keyword
when you declare them.

"downloop or kiteloop...depends where the kite is when you come down.
If the kite is too far in front, kiteloop it and it becomes a helicopter loop (looping above you).
If the kite is too far behind the zenith, downloop it.
Both ways will help to get the kite above you again.
Saved me several times...instead of crashing hard, I landed soft as can be
What do you mean by ""in front""? You mean, it's shot to the edge of the window in the direction you're heading?
And downloop when you're sent the kite too far back on takeoff?
How much height do you need to pull that off?
Usually, I just make sure the kite is ""overhead"" and hold on till the last moment, then redirect hard. It's not always successful though

"“A Fine Addition: New & Notable Acquisitions in Princeton’s Special Collections” highlights recent additions to the holdings of the Department of Rare Books and Special Collections, including the Seeley G. Mudd Manuscript Library, as well as the Marquand Library of Art and Archaeology. The exhibition is on view through August 5 in the Main Gallery of the Firestone Library.
One highlight among many on display is a copy of Andreas Vesalius’s De Humani Corporis Fabrica, first published in Basel in 1543 (read more about the recent acquisition of the first and second edition here). At the official opening on Sunday, April 22, Dr. Eugene Flamm ’58, Jeffrey P. Bergstein Professor and Chairman of the Department of Neurological Surgery at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Montefiore Medical Center, will highlight Princeton’s recent anatomical and phrenological acquisitions with a talk investigating “Observational and Imaginary Anatomy.” The lecture at 2:30 p.m. in Betts Auditorium will be followed by a reception in the Main Gallery. The exhibition and its related events are free and open to the public thanks to the generous support of the Friends of the Princeton University Library.
A Fine Addition: New & Notable Acquisitions in Princeton’s Special Collections
Antiquarian booksellers’ catalogs are rife with superlatives: “The finest copy known,” “a splendid example,” “a fine edition of this extraordinary work.” Yet, exceptional rarity and condition are not sufficient justifications for choosing to acquire one item rather than another. How do curators, librarians, and archivists look beyond a “fine edition” and select items that represent a fine addition to collections as vast and diverse as Princeton’s?
Building on strength is one obvious approach. To Princeton’s extensive holdings of literary archives come new additions to collections of F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, and Mario Vargas Llosa. Recent additions to the University Archives and the Public Policy Papers highlight pivotal moments in the twentieth century: Princeton’s contributions to the Manhattan Project and Secretary of State James A. Baker III’s reactions to the fall of the Berlin Wall and the beginning of Operation Desert Storm. And the Cotsen Children’s Library has complemented some of its important series of picture books with the acquisition of original artwork for them, such as the archive of drawings for the 34-volume Gerlach Jugendbücherei (1900–1920) and Nathalie Chelpanova Parain’s drawings and unbound dummy for the French-language edition of Baba Yaga (Paris, 1932).
Early New Jersey and Revolutionary America have always been well represented at Princeton. A recently acquired map of Pennsylvania from 1791 contains the earliest American illustration of a canal; the map once belonged to Robert Lettis Hooper, a New Jersey patriot who served as deputy quartermaster general in the Continental Army. Even a Western Americana addition has a New Jersey connection: The Yo-Hamite Falls, a lithograph made in 1855 from a drawing by New Jersey native Thomas Ayres, was the first published image of Yosemite Falls.
If the pillars of a collection are easily perceived, so are its gaps. A notable omission among Princeton’s landmarks in the history of science has been corrected with the purchase of the first and second editions of Andreas Vesalius’s monumental anatomical treatise, De humani corporis fabrica (Venice, 1543 and 1555). Recent complements to Vesalius in the Graphic Arts Collection and Marquand Library are the original woodblock used for the frontispiece of Realdo Colombo’s De re anatomica (Venice, 1599) and Pietro da Cortona’s Tabulae anatomicae (Rome, 1741).
Emerging areas of scholarship also influence collecting choices. Over the past decade the Numismatic Collection has been acquiring coins to illustrate the monetary interrelationships throughout the Mediterranean area in the later Middle Ages. Princeton’s example of a gold florin issued in Clarentza is only the third known extant specimen. The Marquand Library has added first editions of the most renowned works of woodblock print artists Katsushika Hokusai and Kitagawa Utamaro. Hokusai’s experimentation with the “colors” of black ink and Utamaro’s mica-sprinkled images can be truly appreciated only in these originals. Likewise, scholars wishing to study the beginnings of the modern artist’s book (livre d’artiste) can turn to the Graphic Arts Collection to find Pierre Bonnard’s personal copy of his masterpiece, Parallèlement (Paris, 1900).
Curators, librarians, and archivists strive to enrich collections by acquiring materials that build on existing strengths, fill perceived gaps, and assist new paths of teaching and scholarship. The diverse acquisitions on display do just that, presenting fine additions to a fine collection.",en,reference

"Of all the major food groups the one that appeals most to the staff at Eye On Golf is pie. Apple and blueberry are our favorite varieties especially a la mode. Humble pie even when served a la mode happens to be the most distasteful, but occasionally it must be endured.
One thing the progenitors of the Eye On Golf staff taught us was that when you make a mistake admit it, apologize, learn from it and move on to be a wiser person. So, heeding that advice, we do need to apologize to LPGA Media Coordinator, Pam Warner, for a question we credited to her in our previous entry. Fact is Ms. Warner did not ask Paula Creamer or Julieta Granada the following question: This is Michelle Wie's home course; do you wish at all that you had a chance to play against her here again? For this misplacement of blame, we apologize.
We can honestly say, however, that through reading several accounts of the incident on the internet that it was not solely our idea that Ms. Warner had posed the question. Nevertheless she did not. Sorry, Pam. If you would like a copy of our latest book, just contact us.
What all this means, however, is that the idiot torch has been passed to one or more reporters on Paradise Island. Professional golfers do not think like that. If they do, they won’t last long.

"Coast Guard warns against following your dog into the surf
Published: Sunday, February 3, 2013 at 3:30 p.m.
Last Modified: Monday, February 4, 2013 at 7:54 a.m.
OAKLAND -- Gabe Pulliam has saved a single dog in the 12 years he's been a rescue swimmer for the U.S. Coast Guard, and he was rewarded by being bitten.
A dog owner himself, Pulliam said he'd risk his own safety again to try and save a canine. But that's only if he is on the job and decked out in a dry suit and other rescue gear.
For everyone else whose noble impulse is to go into Northern California's rugged surf after a pet in distress, Pulliam's message basically boils down to a single word:
The Coast Guard on Friday hosted a media event at the East Bay SPCA in Oakland to highlight that message amid a particularly deadly winter in which four beachgoers have perished in Northern California during events triggered by efforts to save dogs from drowning.
Since 2008, at least seven people have drowned off the coast while making such an attempt. Others have had near misses or been killed after they and their dogs were swept away by a wave, as was the case last Sunday at Shelter Cove in Humboldt County, where officials said a 32-year-old woman drowned after she, her boyfriend and their dog were overcome by a large wave.
The sad irony is that the dogs in all of these cases survived the ordeal save for one, a pug that in 2008 drowned off Portuguese Beach in Sonoma County.
Troubled by the trend, the Coast Guard has launched a public awareness campaign aimed at getting people to reconsider their own natural impulses to rescue their pets.
The campaign features a poster depicting Pulliam wearing his rescue gear and next to him his dog, Peaches, beneath the headline: ""Naturally speaking, who is the better swimmer?""
Without the protective gear, the award goes to the dog, which because of its anatomy is more naturally buoyant and better able to withstand the ocean's frigid temperatures.
""We get in the water and we're in deeper,"" said Allison Lindquist, executive director of the East Bay SPCA. ""A dog will bob along.""
She said dogs also don't panic like humans do.
The dog Pulliam rescued had been stranded on a boat in a river delta, not flailing about in rough surf.
Lindquist said it's ""understandable"" that people try and save their pets. But her ""unequivocal"" advice is to never attempt it.
""Just don't,"" she said.
Two women have died off Portuguese Beach in Sonoma County since 2008 after they attempted to rescue their dogs. A third woman drowned that year after she went after her dog off Gualala Beach.
On Nov. 24, three members of a Eureka family drowned at Big Lagoon in Humboldt County after one of them tried to save the family dog from drowning.
And on New Year's Day this year, 59-year-old Charlie Quaid of Richmond drowned at Point Reyes National Seashore after Quaid's wife and the couple's pit bull were swept up in the waves.
Even at beaches where the surf appears calm, hidden riptides or steep underwater drop-offs represent a risk to anyone who ventures into the cold water without proper attire and advanced swimming skills.
By law, dogs are not allowed off leash at any beach on the Sonoma County coast and in several places dogs are banned outright to protect sensitive wildlife or vegetation.
In other places where dogs are allowed off-leash, Lindquist said, she would not go so far as to recommend that every dog-owner keep their animals tethered to keep them from going in the water.
Instead, she advised people to consider their animal's size and capabilities before deciding whether to let their pet run free at the beach.
Experts on Friday also recommended against tossing a ball or other object in the surf for their dog to retrieve. They said an animal can get so focused on that effort that it forgets where it is and gets into trouble.
The same can be said of their masters, who can get caught unaware by so-called ""sneaker"" or ""rogue"" waves simply by turning their backs to the sea.
""It only takes six inches of moving water to knock over a full-grown, able-bodied adult,"" said Alexandra Picavet, a public affairs officer for the National Park Service.
Winter is a particularly dangerous time because of the high surf, said Pam Boehland with the Coast Guard. She said when she accompanies her husband on one of his surfing outings, they leave their dog, Rascal, at home.
""I sit away from the water and read a book,"" she said.

"episode 24 mohammad khan
I was in Bhendi Bazaar to buy two more flower painted trucks as I was still caught up in the post-rains house cleanup and organising efforts. I walked up Mohammad Ali Rd in the late-afternoon-almost-evening time of the day when the sun is so low in the sky its rays no longer light even the tops of the tallest buildings. Parked on the side of the road was Mohammad Mustaqeen Khan. He has been driving taxi for about 24 years. He came to Bombay from UP, a strong 20 year old man from a village, and started out in haath gadi at Do Tanki in Chor Bazaar area. Twenty-six years later he has bought more land, rebuilt his home, married off 4 children, all from driving taxi. We talk about street level economics, how much he used to make and what it bought, how much he makes now and what it buys. Click on ‘mohammad khan podcast’ link below to stream or right click to download. (25 min 8 sec)
mohammad khan: panch chhe rupiya mein kitna khasakta tha
Tur dal is Rs115/kilo. Tomater is Rs40/kilo. kanda/piyaz/onion are Rs18/kilo. one small bunch of kothmir/dhaniya is Rs5. Bhindi is Rs80/kilo. a kela/banana is Rs2. So what if cell phone rates have gone down and SMS is cheaper. What are people eating? How are people eating. We used to think of dal/roti as a staple, a fall back, the food of the masses. Or a roti and an onion. The only way to make dal now to keep within a budget is half the dal and double the pani. I was at MTNL the other day and the woman there told me she has stopped having people come home. In the outtake below Mohammad Khan talks about mangai. (28 sec)
We went up Ambedkar Rd, over the Byculla Bridge, out Saat Raasta to Moses Rd. You hear me tell him to take Tulsi Pipe. Its a good view and I want to track the changes in the skyline, the ‘progress’ of the buildings emerging from where Jupiter and Elphistone Mills used to be. Below are photos of Ambedkar Rd, just before the Byculla Bridge.
My father always taught me economics by asking how long it takes to earn my do roti. What Mohammad Khan is saying is that he used to eat for 5-6 rupees what today costs Rs 30-35. He earns at the end of the day almost three times as much as he did when he started driving taxi but his costs have gone up much more. If in 10 hours he earned 80 rupees it took him about 40 minutes to earn dinner. If in 10 hours he now earns 250 rupees, its taking him an hour and about 10 minutes to earn dinner. And I didn’t ask him about room rent.
We started talking about 26/11 but the conversation quickly turned to driving a private vehicle. He drove for a man from his village that does bhangaar and has an Ambassador. He was paid Rs600/mo. This is the same amount the Sevalal earns driving a Honda City for the wife of the couple that live in the luxury highrise. (1 min 15 sec)
There was an article in DNA with the headline ‘Mumbai Taxis May Soon Turn Yellow’. You can read it here. I haven’t read about it anywhere else but according to the article, the state transport minister Vikhe-Patil announced at a taxi man’s union meeting that he wanted the kaali-peeli taxis to have a make-over, to match this new imaginary city. As he put it, “With the changing skyline of the city and with the introduction of the metro and the monorail, the taxis should also don a new look.” I put that at about the same level of governance and economic upliftment as I do the renaming of the airports. Thinking outside the colour scheme or at least half of it. The taxi union has agreed if the city pays for it..’incentives for the expenditure to be incurred’. Least they could do after not giving any incentives on the expenditures incurred on the new vehicles for cancelled fiats.
More on our city. We decided to take SV Rd instead of Reclamation to avoid that massive jam at Lilavati that happens every evening now that the Sealink traffic empties at high speeds onto that road and impatient drivers commandeer the opposite side of the road, thus backing up traffic in that direction and turning the Lilavati junction to gridlock.. SV Rd of course isn’t better and is further exacerbated by the skywalk being built down the middle of the street. He is more hopeful than I am. (18 sec)
I am hopeful too. I love this city.

"MillerCoors is gearing up for summer, committing to a season-long sponsorship deal with Turner Entertainment that includes integrations seeded throughout original TBS, TNT and truTV programming.
Beginning June 10, the beer manufacturer’s Miller Lite brand will be featured in a live commercial set to run on TBS’ late-night talk show Lopez Tonight. (Host George Lopez will talk up the curious new Miller Lite Vortex bottle, which looks like a standard 12-oz glass container, but for a series of spiral grooves ringing the inside of the neck.) The Milwaukee brew will be visible on the Lopez set all summer long, bubbling up in an on-stage VIP lounge and on an in-show billboard.
Joining Miller Lite on TBS is the three-year-old ultra-light brand MGD 64, which will play a supporting role in My Boys, returning for its fourth and final season July 25. The placement is a particularly apt fit for my Boys, a sitcom about a Chicago sports columnist and her posse of male friends. (Beer is featured so prominently in the show that it’s practically a character.)
MGD 64 will also make a splash on TNT’s new cop drama, Rizzoli & Isles, appearing in custom tune-ins and on-air billboards. The Angie Harmon vehicle bows July 12.
Finally, Miller Lite will reprise its earlier deal with truTV’s Black Gold, lining up for an eight-episode arc in season three of the unscripted series.
The Turner-MillerCoors deal was orchestrated by Initiative and the beer maker’s in-house unit, MillerCoors Media.
Turner’s portfolio of three entertainment networks allows Miller Coors “to showcase both brands to a relevant audience,” said Linda Yaccarino, executive vp and chief operating officer, Turner Entertainment ad sales/marketing and acquisitions, by way of announcing the deal. “This smart collaboration is another example of placing the right spots in the right places at the right times.”
Miller Lite last year invested $134 million in measured media in 2009, per Kantar Media data. Flagship Coors Light spent $152 million in 2009. Miller Genuine Draft, MGD 64 and Keystone are lighter spenders, together laying out around $22 million on media.",en,web

2007 Kia Rondo
Question: Should the transmission fluid be changed on the automatic trans in this car?
Answer #1Visitor, August 24, 2010, 00:17
Yes. The transmission fluid and filter should be changed and the gasket replaced with a new one when the service schedule recommends. There should also be a magnet in the transmission case pan that should be inspected/ cleaned for metal shavings. It is really quite easy to do...most vehicles don't need a complete flush that the dealers push.
ReplyBills On Broadway, September 07, 2010, 07:24Technician
Yes you should flush the transmission fluid, there are two ways of doing it. You can pull the pan and the filter, which only replaces 1/4 of the transmission fluid, or have a complete flush done in reverse, which helps clean the filter, and all of the fluid.",en,web
"Five years ago next week, Madeleine McCann disappeared from a family holiday apartment in the Algarve, Portugal. Why has the little girl, aged three when she went missing, never been found? Madeleine's parents, Kate and Gerry McCann, are adamant that their daughter was abducted. Frustrated by Portuguese police and public opinion that viewed them with suspicion, Madeleine's parents persuaded prime minister David Cameron to order a review of the case. Is this new investigation, by a top unit of the Metropolitan Police, the last chance of discovering what happened? For the first time, the senior UK investigator tells Panorama how he is working collaboratively with Portuguese police and explains why he believes he has the best opportunity yet to help solve the mystery of Madeleine McCann.",en,reference

They’re more than a tribute, they’re words to live by. In fact, of all the eloquent and heartfelt expressions of loss and appreciation since Ray Bradbury’s passing, these are the ones that, for me, cut to the heart of the matter. I’m talking about what Guillermo del Toro said yesterday in a brief note [...]
A connection with the point-of-view character sometimes isn’t made because words and ideas somehow get in the way of immediacy rather than reinforcing it. So when we attempt to show the cost of not appreciating literature by referencing the beauty and profundity of those words and ideas, we’re possibly compounding the problem…",en,web
"Jimmy Tingle's comedy campaign
Most presidential aspirants aren’t known for waxing funny — not intentionally, anyway — but Jimmy Tingle is here to change that.
The longtime comedian, who you might recognize from his HBO special or appearances on “The Tonight Show With Jay Leno” and “Late Night With Conan O’Brien,” is out with a new one-man show — “Jimmy Tingle for President: The Funniest Campaign in History” — in which he takes the expected potshots at politicos:Continue Reading
“You don’t want a reader in the White House? Fine, bring Sarah Palin out of retirement. She’d be very helpful with the Arab Spring. She can see the pyramids from her house.”
“Michele Bachmann is a very, very moral person. She has five children, 24 foster children. If her family showed up at the polls, she could have won Iowa.”
“Mitt Romney is now running as a severe conservative. He’s no longer solidly pro-choice. He supports a woman’s right to choice in cases of rape or incest or to protect the life of a candidate.”
But Tingle’s show, which debuted April 18 at famed New York comedy club Carolines on Broadway, isn’t just one long rant. It has an unexpected, sincere purpose.
“I’m looking at it in terms of it being an aspirational show,” Tingle told POLITICO. “It’s not about how this guy’s terrible and that guy’s terrible.” Tingle calls his political party “Humor for Humanity.” He’s a religious, recovering alcoholic and thinks the world could use more “humor in healing, humor in helping, humor in hope.”
“I think we need a spiritual debate in this country and not only about condoms and birth control but larger issues,” he said.
Tingle, who earned a master’s degree in public administration from Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government in 2010, also admits that while he’s politically left of center, being too stringent is bad business.
“It has a polarizing effect,” said Tingle. “You literally lose half the audience. … If you start off with, ‘Republicans do this,’ and, ‘Democrats do that,’ just the words can alienate people.”",en,web
"Local football star shines during NFL game
Posted at: 01/05/2013 8:30 PM
| Updated at: 01/05/2013 10:49 PM
By: KOB.com Staff
A local man who used to go to Valley High School was the star of one of the day's NFL wild card games.
Arian Foster plays for the Houston Texans. He's been taking off in the NFL and Saturday, KOB Eyewitness News 4 spoke to some of his old coaches about his success.
Foster's former basketball coaches at Valley High School said it wasn't always obvious that he would go pro.
""As a freshman basketball player, did you think he was going to be playing in the NFL...probably not,"" Joe Coleman said.
""Arian was a little chubby basketball player as a freshman and a sophomore but you could see that he had some raw skills,"" Ben Santistevan said.
Fast forward to now as he plays for the Houston Texans. Foster helped them get a win against the Cincinnati Bengals.
Coleman says even with all this success Foster is remaining grounded.
He said Foster came back to Valley High a few years ago to watch a game with fans.
""The way he handled himself and as polite as he was to all the people trying to get autographs,"" Coleman said. ""He spent all day there, came to the locker room and spent most of the evening there talking to all of our players.""
And that grounding stayed with Foster even after Saturday's win in an post-game interview.
""You gotta come out and bring your best, you can get beat on any day,"" Foster said.
Foster has played for the Texans since 2009.",en,web

"Episode Title: 'Ki'ilua'
Writer: Peter Lenkov and Paul Zbyszewski
Director: Kate Woods
When a reporter turns up dead, H50 is on the case. The team learns that the woman was working on a story about a CIA operation codenamed ""Switchback."" Meanwhile, McGarrett (Alex O'Loughlin) meets with Jenna Kaye (Larisa Oleynik), who asks for his help in rescuing her fiance from Wo Fat in North Korea.
After learning that the woman the reporter was least seen with was Jenna, Danny (Scott Caan) reaches out to McGarrett. However Jenna made a deal with Wo Fat to exchange McGarrett for her fiance. When she learns her fiance is dead, Jenna knocks out a guard and calls Danny, letting him know about the situation.
Commander White (Terry O'Quinn), along with SEAL commander, Wade Gutches (David Keith), help Chin Ho (Daniel Dae Kim), Konno (Grace Park), Danny and Weston (Lauren German) arrange transportation to North Korea. Elsewhere, Wo Fat (Mark Mascascos) has McGarrett tied up in a cell, questioning the Navy SEAL about Joe White and someone, or something, known as ""Shellburn.""
Once they arrive in Seoul, Joe brings the team to a bar to meet with Frank Bama (Jimmy Buffett), an old friend and helicopter pilot who owes Joe a favor. He takes the team across the border. However, Wo Fat has already fled the compound in a caravan with McGarrrett as a prisoner. Weston, remaining on board the chopper, has Frank follow Wo Fat's convoy. She blocks their path with a well placed shot from an RPG. When they double back, Wo Fat's men come up against a road block, with the rest of the 5-0 team in place. Danny frees McGarrett but Wo Fat manages to escape into the jungle.
'Ki'ilua', which means ""Deceiver"" felt like a Robert Ludlum novel with a ""Margaritaville"" twist. And once again, ""Hawaii Five-0"" proves itself as one of the most competent, action-packed procedurals on TV.
Touching back to the Wo Fat mystery, the team headed to North Korea to get wannabe boy scout McGarrett out of tight spot. I was a bit surprised by the anti-climatic disposal of Jenna Kaye, but her death at the hands of Wo Fat felt right at this point in the story. So much for those of you shipping a Jenna/McGarrett hook-up…
Of course the highlight of the hour was Jimmy Buffett flying ""Tangerine,"" a rickety old chopper better suited to housing livestock than leaving the ground. As always, ""H50"" has fun with its subject matter, even if it is a top secret rogue SEAL team mission in North Korea.
And it was kinda sweet to see Chin Ho pop the question to his old flame, Malia. ""H50's"" been a bit touch and go with the love connections, (see Danno and ex-wife, Danno and Dr. Asano, McG and bootycall, Lt. Rollins and Konno and Fong) I'm interested to see what the angle is here. Plus, I happen to be a Reiko Aylesworth fan so call me biased. And it was also great to have Terry O'Quinn and ""Lonestar's"" David Keith return to back up the team on ""Operation Save Steve.""
The question now is how much more of the Wo Fat storyline will we get when ""H50"" returns? After spending a few hours in a North Korean dungeon with a stun gun for a wake up call,McGarrett's got to have taking out his father's killer on the brain. Not to mention the situation Wo Fat put Jenna in and her untimely fate.
A few additional observations on 'Ki'ilua:'
- Did Jenna really dig a lock-picking tool out of her dead fiance's knee? Damn, that's gangsta.
- Since when does McGarrett speak Korean?
- Danno turns down a drink from Jimmy Buffett, saying he'd prefer a Margarita. See what they did there?
- Gotta love the 8-track player in Buffett's chopper blasting The James Gang.
- Awww, Chin Ho's gettin' hitched. This won't go well, will it?
'Ki'ilua' hit all the sweet spots for a sweeps worthy episode of ""Hawaii Five-0."" Guest star Jimmy Buffett was put to good use as hippie helicopter pilot, Frank Bama, McGarrett was in action hero mode and we got some serious movement on the Wo Fat storyline. North Korea isn't exactly ""Margaritaville"" but somehow ""Hawaii Five-0"" managed to pull a rather dark episode off while accommodating a very colorful guest star.

"CELF Project Proposal/Suppress Xvnc dependency on C++
- Suppress Xvnc dependency on C++
- Philippe De Muyter
Vnc is a useful protocol to connect a thin-client to a server, or in the case of embedded systems to connect a gui client to a display-less embedded system. Xvnc is the combination of a X11 server able to run all the known X11 applications, and of a vnc server offering a thin-client interface to a remote user. It offers the advantage over http that it can show spontaneous events at the server side without polling from the user side, and that it can use every X11 existing application to build the interface. For video applications it also offers for free zero-delay streaming.
Although the Xorg server is written exclusively in C, the Xvnc part is written in C++. That makes its footprint unnecessarily larger, and limits its availability to platforms for which a working C++ (cross-)compiler exists. This is not always the case, even if the C compiler works.
Here are IIRC the c++ files :
./pvnc-1.0.5/vnc_unix/xc/programs/Xserver/vnc/Xvnc/xvnc.cc ./pvnc-1.0.5/vnc_unix/xc/programs/Xserver/vnc/vncHooks.cc ./pvnc-1.0.5/vnc_unix/xc/programs/Xserver/vnc/xf86vncModule.cc ./pvnc-1.0.5/vnc_unix/xc/programs/Xserver/vnc/module/XserverDesktop.cc ./pvnc-1.0.5/vnc_unix/xc/programs/Xserver/vnc/module/vncExtInit.cc

"SFAI Painting Professor to Lecture at Hamilton Col
Brett Reichman, a painter and associate professor of painting at the San Francisco Art Institute (SFAI) will speak at Hamilton College in its Visiting Artist Series.
Reichman received his master’s degree from the University of California at Berkley in 1984. His work is considered a detailed approach to realism which addresses issues of identity; he often employs exaggeration and fanciful staging to question societal norms. He has created numerous exhibitions, most recently Simulations, in 2010 at Gallery Paule Anglim, in San Francisco; Silence, Exile and Cunning, in 2010 at Sonoma Valley Museum of Art, in Sonoma, Calif.; and Pacific Light: A Survey of California Watercolor 1908-2008, in 2008 at the Nordic Watercolor Museum in Skärhamn, Sweden.

The complaint says Atkinson told police he put Adler, who was asleep, on a couch and tried to wake him up. He then dragged him to an upstairs bedroom. When he awoke the next morning, Atkinson again tried to wake Adler, then dragged him to the patio.

Seems like it would work. Just make sure that the adapter properly matches the wires to the other side.

You could also just buy a 9-pin serial extension cord, and cut one end off. Look in the computer cables area for a 9-pin serial, or 9-pin mouse extension cable.

"Why are you exhibiting at équip’baie métalexpo 2010?
This show is a perfect match for our professional activity, and as a leader in the steel sections market we must be present at équipbaiemétalexpo, just as much as at Batimat.
The show’s role as an attractive product shop window provides us with the opportunity to present our innovations and the new products we are developing to the body of visitors as a whole and to architects in particular.
What is your objective in exhibiting?
Ahead of the show, we are working on two key targets, specifiers and our customers, who are metal working companies. We are using a press campaign to invite them to pay us a visit. To ensure consistency, we are saying absolutely the same things to these two targets, focusing very much on our new products, in order to get a uniform and consistent message across.
The same is true for the press
What is your headline product/innovation/project for this salon?
This year we are setting out to present a truly exceptional headline product, which is undoubtedly the most important concept at the show. This is the heated window. It’s a real revolution. Through its heated glazing, the window becomes a radiator and radiates a gentle, uniform heat throughout the home. It offers an energy saving of between 25 and 40%, over traditional heating, whilst eliminating conventional radiators…. that’s really clean energy
We have already tested this product in our steel conservatories and the results have been spectacular, given the fact that glazed areas are the source of the most significant losses.
We will also be presenting our ideas for photovoltaic façades to specifiers, and these, together with the heated window, will be the subject of two talks that KDI will be involved in at the show.
Who is it aimed at?
With the photovoltaic façade we are clearly aiming at customers and specifiers, whilst the heated window is directed both at specifiers (architects and design offices) and our traditional customers, the metal working companies, whilst also addressing the general public who, one must not forget, are becoming more and more active as specifiers.",en,web

"A few weeks ago, my friend Amanda gave me a challenge: Find a pair of women’s workout shorts that don’t ride up. I was happy to oblige, as I’ve experienced my share of creeping, inching, annoying legs that need to be tugged back down every few strides. If your thighs have any sort of roundness to them, from muscle or whatever, you probably know what I’m talking about.
So I asked all of the big workout apparel players to send me their best new won’t-ride-up shorts, and most obliged. Surprisingly, many of the companies sent traditional-style running shorts. That puzzled me, as I’ve never met a running short that didn’t ride up at least a bit. OK, maybe if I were the proud owner of a pair of tiny-girl, straight-as-sticks legs, it wouldn’t be an issue. But I’m not, so…
I ended up trying a dozen pairs altogether (great workout motivation, I’ll tell you that). I walked in them, skated in them, did jumping jacks in them, and lunged in them, looking for the slightest hint of creep. Two pairs made the cut, and I’m proud to introduce them to you.
The Athleta Fusion Short is the cuter, more flattering of the two. It has the perfect mixture of stretch and hold, and the legs are semifitted—proving that shorts don’t need to be plastered to your skin to stay put. The material moves with you, breathes well, and is antimicrobial to boot. The cut is flattering, with a wide waistband and cute back pockets to add a little flair.
The comfy Lucy Swift Knee Short comes down right above the knee (hence the name)—and stays there. There’s a kicky little vent at the back of each knee and a small zippered pocket on the back waistband to hold a key or a few bucks—both nifty little extras. Like the Athleta shorts, these have just enough Lycra to give them light shape, plus they breathe and wick well. The only drawback is that the elastic-waist style isn’t very forgiving for women with even a hint of a belly, so if that’s you, wear these with a slightly longer top. (But you know that trick already.)
Mission accomplished, Amanda!

Tonight, the search continues for a missing offshore worker in the Gulf of Mexico. Updated numbers tonight, six have survived, three killed and one is still missing after being forced to evacuate during Tropical Storm Nate.
Originally we told you seven were rescued, but one worker from Bangeldesh died after being taken to the hospital. Among the survivors, New Iberia native Ted Derise Jr. and Jeremy Parfait of Houma.
They were rescued after spending three days in the open seas. The men were doing work for Houston based Geokinetics on a ""lift""-boat owned by Trinity Liftboat Services.
Family of Derise said his rescue is a relief. He and Houma resident Parfait, like the other survivors, are in stable condition in a private hospital in Mexico tonight. The workers were rescued on Sunday by the Mexican Navy.
Four of the survivors and one of the dead were found in a boat. The other three survivors and another body were found floating in the water. Officials said the survivors are suffering from bruises, bumps and sun burns after battling through the storm.
As for when Derise will return home, his family doesn't know but says they are just happy he's alive.
Mexican authorities have not yet said if Iberia natives Nick Reed and Craig Myers are among the dead or missing.

Mesothelial/monocytic incidental cardiac excrescence (MICE) is a rare entity which is an amalgam of mesothelial cells, histiocytes, and fibrin, often found occasionally during cardiac valve replacement. We report a case in a 25-year-old Chinese female with serous mitral stenosis and patent foramen ovale. Routine and immunohistochemical stains and ultrastructure examination revealed the vegetation was predominantly composed of histocytes with scattered mesothelial cells. In fact nodular histiocytic/mesothelial hyperplasia (NHMH) is a similar lesion to MICE. MICE and NHMH could be unified, and NHMH may be a better choice.",en,academic
"Support & Resistance
Support & Resistance
The price action of a security over a period of time will create strength at certain price levels. These levels are known as ""resistance"" at the top end of the range of trading, and ""support"" at the bottom end of the trading range. This trading range may develop over just a couple of months, or sometimes it can take a year or more to develop. This usually depends on the range the technician is examining.
For our example, we'll look at Air Canada stock. In the later part of the 1990s, Air Canada stock traded in a very narrow range of $5 on the low side and $7 on the high side, creating what we call support at $5 and resistance at $7. There was enormous support at the lower range because, over a long period of time, hundreds of thousands of shares had changed hands at or about the five dollar point, thus creating a very strong support level or ""floor"". Simply put, it would've required an extraordinary increase in selling activity for the price to fall below the $5 mark.
Conversely, trading activity at the higher price over the several years was at $7 - the stock price could not seem to break through this number. For whatever reason, the sellers would outnumber the buyers every time the stock price of Air Canada would climb to the $7 range. This ""ceiling"" or resistance created an interesting play for traders who recognized the trading pattern. They would buy the stock as it neared the $5 mark, and then sell it (and even go short) a few months later when it began to approach the $7 range. This awarded them with some very healthy profits.
As the price of a security breaks through the resistance level and moves to a higher ground, the level of resistance now becomes the level of support. A new level of resistance will then be formed at some point in the future. On the flip side of the coin, as the price range falls below the support level, that level then becomes the new resistance mark.
Understanding the concepts of trending and trendlines is important to learning about support and resistance. During a market trending to the upside, resistance levels are formed as the price action slows for an extended period of time. Pauses in the market often result from profit taking or near-term uncertainty for a particular issue or sector. The resulting price action undergoes a ""plateau"" effect or slight drop-off in stock price, creating an area of resistance. As a market falls off into a downtrend, the opposite occurs, creating levels of support.
I consider support and resistance vastly important. In my book its 3rd in importance to price and volume.Knowing where your resistance is at can save you from buying a stock at the top. ASDF stock has resistance at .99 but has been trading at .90 it moves up rather quickly to .97. Do not buy the stock at this price. Its infinitly better to wait and see if It can surpass its resistance. In most cases it will pull back at resistance allowing you to get in at a better price. Volume is going to play a roll here as well. Remember this on resistance most daytraders and swing traders will sell at the resistance level to secure their profits. They will continue to monitor to see if it breaks resistance and if it does and the stock is strong they may reenter.
Support is generally a time you want to think about buying. But its not foolproof. This is where other indicators play a roll.",en,reference

I am designing a RF high isolation switch of 6 samples. I am thinking into use HMC252QS24 from HITTITE. The problem is that the isolation I obtain between signals is around -50dBm but I need more. I am thinking into interconnect a monolitic amplifier into each signal and switch ON/OFF the amplifier in order to increase the isolation...
Any more ideas?Better low cost solution?Another interesting solution¿

Looking at the data sheet the best you can do from the 'common' line to any other is 38 dB (DC to 1GHz) and this drops to 26 dB at 3 GHz. The data sheet does not show the isolation between channels that are both 'off' If this is what you are referring to then you can measure this and if this is the 50 dB figure you mention then thats not bad. Note that much of the isolation will be down to your board layout. If this is done well you may be able to improve on your 50 dB figure. A simple way to work out what is down to the layout is to remove the IC, terminate the unused pads with 0402 size 51 ohm resistors and measure the isolation and see what you get. This removes the 'leakage' that goes on inside the IC from the problem and tells you what the layout is like. I suggest you then ask the IC manufacturer what they think is possible.
Ultimately, if you want a lot more isolation I suggest you use separate IC's and get some physical separation between your channels. You will then be able to go a log higher in isolation.
Ensure you use a microstrip layout or better still a coplanar.

I found a good solution by using x6 units of MINICIRCUITS with code M3SWA-2-50DR+ for each sample and then connect the outputs of each switch to the input of switch of HITTITE HMC252QS24. By simulating in ADS I obtain very good isolation between inputs around 90dB. The problem is that solution is expensive around 25 dollars only in IC's. I am using six signals of 10MHz, 36MHz, 1950MHZ, 1056MHz 1052MHz 1550MHz.
This first solution sounds good but on the other hand is expensive and fills a lot of space in the PCB. Any cheap idea to do the same??

You are having troubles because the laws of physics are against you. Switches have isolation because either:
1: they use a device that provides a dead short circuit shunt to ground.
2) they use a device that provides a series open circuit
In the first case, the ""dead short circuit"" involves connecting the bottom of the chip to the ground plane by via hole(s). If the via hole is a real-world part, it has inductance and resistance. In other words, it is not a ""dead short circuit"", and as such has limited ability to totally reflect a signal.
In the second case, the ""open circuit"" is not pure either. There is often some capacitance in the diode or fet that lets some signal blead thru, instead of being totally reflected. Also, there can be crosstalk between two arms of the switch, especially where the arms have to converge onto a small space to connect to the semiconductor itself.
So, you have practical limitations as to how much isolation you can get out of one semiconductor. To solve this, you want to cascade additional devices, physically separated from one another. To do so successfully, you need to know something about the internals of the device. For a FET series shunt sp2t switch, you could add an additional shunt short circuit element (like a pin diode) quarterwave away from each of the inputs. Alternatively, you could add an additional shunt element at any distance away from the IC, but only IF the IC has a nonreflective port when in isolation mode. You do not want a resonant length between the IC and additional elements, causing a ""bandpass"" response instead of the desired isolation.

"Have read numerous articles that teams are supposedly lining up to make Cruz an offer once FA starts. Public knowledge indicates the GMen will put a first round tender on him so if a team makes him an offer we don't match. We get their 1st round pick. Because the Rams have 2 first round draft picks, I've been hearing they very well use one of those picks to make Cruz a substantial long term offer.
Obviously tampering allegations would be enforced if a team publicly expressed the interest to make an offer to an RFA prior to the FA period, so this all could be a smoke screen being produced by Cruz's agent to create some urgency from the Giants FO, so no one really knows. But the past 2 days I've been hearing more and more of this.
Personally, I would love to give Cruz up for a 1st round pick. He's 26 years old, we have Nicks and Randle is looking to break out this year. We could lock down a stud OL and LB/CB with 2 picks in the first round, get considerably younger and have more cap space to sign Nicks to a long term deal. If Cruz does indeed leave for a 1st round pick, 3 picks within the first 2 rounds would do wonders for us. Just my opinion, but with Eli at the helm, he makes everyone around him better. And with a beast, young OL and running game, Eli will have even more time to pick apart defenses.

Basically, you sew two different widths of long strips of binding together, fold in half, and apply to the back of the quilt like regular binding.

Sorry for the lousy photo quality -- I can't seem to get the lightest pink to not wash out without making everything else muddy.
Tomorrow -- a much needed cut & color, and hoping to get the teal strippy quilt quilted. It might end up with a two-color binding too...

This doesn't show up well, but it's a pale purple batik with little marks
This is gray with white dots
This is a black floral on white
I was looking for something that would fade into the background a bit and blend with a few of the other fabrics... opinions?

Anyway, back to the wall. I think I have all the blocks done for this one, and now that I look at the picture I can see at least one area where I have some of them turned the wrong way. One of my errands this weekend will be to find something to use for the setting triangles -- I think it will be something black & white to sort of fade into the background, but I'm not sure yet.
After I took the photo this morning I looked out the window and saw this:which is just the shimmery effect I want in my quilt!
On the yarn front, WendyKnits is having a summer mystery knit-along for a small shawl. I always love a mystery and I've never really knit lace before, so I decided to join in. I had a rocky time with the first dozen rows and ended up starting over. Now I'm using stitch markers (I was too cool to use them the first time) and things are going much better.
The pattern starts at the wide end of the triangle and gets smaller as you go along, which is a very nice way to work. I've kept up so far, but there's quite a bit to do before the final instruction sheet is posted next Thursday. It's not too late to jump in... and there's a group on Ravelry with lots of chatter and photos.

Special thanks to Wanda, who explained the mystery of the pleats to me!
I know that quilters use their irons more than the average person, and we tend to leave them on longer, too. But really -- this planned obsolescence thing is jut going too far! We should have to expect to buy a new iron every year...
I returned the B&D Classic yesterday but there was nothing else interesting at Target or at Orchard Supply nearby. Since some friends are coming over for a sewing day today, I ran out to the local Ace Hardware this morning to see what I could find. I ended up with another B&D:It's a ""Digital Advantage"" with a little extra wattage. I think this is similar to the one I had before, which lasted a couple of years. I plugged it in and gave it a whirl...
For quilting, I think it will be good. It heats up fast, irons smoothly, and puts out a lot of steam. But. There is no way to control the steam other than by turning down the temperature. The higher the temp, the more steam you get. My older version didn't work that way, and why would they think that was a good thing to change? I guess I could always just pour out the water if I want to iron dry, right?
And, try as I might, I couldn't get the sprayer to work at all. (it said to pump it a few times the first time you used it, but still nothing). Sigh. Back to the spray bottle.

Well, I'm about to stop messing around with losers and just go back to a very old, stodgy friend.
The last iron I sort of liked was a mid-priced Black & Decker that lasted about 2 or 3 years -- long term! -- and then something went wrong and it started spewing rusty water on my fabric.
Before that was a somewhat pricier Rowenta that cracked after a few years and just stopped working.
When the B&D failed, I bought a cheap Proctor Silex at CVS with a 25% off coupon... it's a steam iron, but it doesn't seem to put out any steam on its own -- only when you press the button. And the ""cotton"" setting feels more like ""rayon"" to me. A piece of junk, but of course I tossed the box and the receipt before I figured it out. Can you say ""freecycle""?
Then last weekend I was trolling in Target and picked up this Black & Decker ""Classic"". How could I resist the retro look and the hefty weight of it?
It definitely steams, and it gets REALLY hot. But this is what else it does:
I have never had an iron do this before, and this one does it over and over. I don't know if it's something about the finish on the soleplate -- not very shiny -- or if it's something about the shape. But I know I can't live with it, so it's going back tomorrow morning.
And what I'm left with now is this trusty 20+ year old guy from up in the cupboard. I put him away when I started quilting 10 years ago and decided I needed an upgrade. He still gets hot and puts out steam and doesn't pleat my fabric!But, there's no automatic shut-off (I know some people hate that feature, but I don't) and worse is that the plug gets quite hot, so it makes me a little nervous to use it at all, let alone leave it plugged in any longer than I need to.
PLEASE could someone tell me about an iron that they love, that's lasted more than a year or two, and that I might love, too?

I love braided quilts -- in fact one of the very first quilts I made was a braided one. (long pause while I look for a photo, realize I don't have a photo, go take a photo and upload it...)
I took a class to learn how to do this; everything about this early quilt is a little wonky -- especially the quilting -- and I'm not thrilled with the pink fabric in the sashing, but I still like the overall effect.
I know there are a couple of books out on braided quilt techniques -- have you tried any of them?
Saturday, May 14, 2011
We decided to do a project with 20 shared black & white fabrics and 20 ""other fabrics"" that would make each quilt individual.
This is Kuniyo's quilt -- it's about 3/4 black & white and the rest red. Love it!Enelda had a cold and wasn't sewing as fast, so she plans to finish at home -- love the colors! She was using a set of batik strips.
This one is mine -- my signature jewel tones. I'm not thrilled with the light colors I used; I think I should have stuck with medium/dark ones.
Kathy used a wide variety of strips for her top. She didn't like it but the rest of us did.
Finally, Susan's -- I think the purples and blues blend really well with the black & white. She was expecting to not like the result, but ended up pleased with it!
If you're going to try this, here are a couple of hints:
- if you're using batiks or other fabrics that look very similar on both sides, be careful not to flip your strips when you're doing the first step of sewing them end to end.
- take a couple of minutes to fold the 1600"" strip in accordion pleats across your lap before sewing the first long seam. It will help prevent everything becoming a twisted mess.
- several of us tried putting all the black & white strips first, and then our other strips -- this helped distribute the colors more evenly, but wasn't perfect! (I mixed my lightest colors in with the black & white and then finished with all the darker colors, and this didn't work so well)
Coming next: scrappy pink stuff.

I like patterns that are based on blocks but allow a lot of opportunity to play with the arrangement of color. Since I've been in a monochromatic mood lately I also really liked playing with such a variety of greens -- and using up some odd bits in the process.
Be sure to visit the Festival page for links to all the other participants.
You can see how lucky he was that the hit came just behind the driver's seat... He came out of it a bit(!) startled but otherwise unscathed.
There's a crazy stretch of freeway here called ""the maze"" where two roads come together and then diverge again, with lots of folks criss-crossing -- two vehicles in the next lane collided and one lost control and veered into Al. Phew!
I posted this yesterday but noticed this morning that it had completely disappeared... strange things happening on Blogger!

"What is ""E-commerce"" ?
E-commerce is the term used to describe the selling of products and services over the Internet. In the most general sense, ecommerce development means simply creating a Web site that advertises and promotes your products can be considered ""E-commerce.""
e commerce businesses now offer elaborate online stores where customers can browse thousands of products, place an order, select the desired shipping method and pay for their purchases using their credit cards.
Why do you need to set up an E-commerce Web site?
It depends upon a number of factors, such as how you want to handle transactions and what types of security you want to provide. For example, if you don't need to accept credit cards or process transactions online, all you need is a web site that lists your products, provides some sort of order form and lists the address where your customers should send their payments. More or less all survey says approx 2 buyer purchase your product among all 100 visitors. Means if you have 500 visits per day in your ecommerce site then you will able to get 10 sales that sure. Because that is the minimum value. Maximum value can be anything. If your product is too lucrative then sales might be boost to 50 from every 100 visitors and don’t forget leads are less converted rather than sales. If you will say someone visit our site and come to our store to purchase then mature leads will be 10% means on every 100 leads you will able to get only 10.The following example will clear that concept more.
Lets assume you have a shop and you have a website which have a visit of 1000 in a month.As leads conversion rate is also 2 % so 20 visitors(1000/100*2=20) will interested to buy the product. But as your site is not ecommerce based so 20 users will call on your number and ask about the product details. Now you say’s them to come in your shop and purchase or delivery based on the payment. But as server says only 10% is the mature rate of leads. So you will get only 2 visitors who will come to your shop and purchase.(10/100*20=2) but if your website is ecommerce based then you will able to get 20 buyer instead of 2 as already described above the conversion rate of interested buyer. It’s too easy for you to maintain the site and get report of monthly, yearly, quarterly sales. Our software are very user-friendly and can able to make that very easy where other software are not able to give you that kind of features. One more thing you have to be sure about the payment process. Is it secure and bugs free? Yes our software are perfect for your requirement. Lot of our client are using that software for last 3-4 years and they are able to sale a huge amount of product and able to income an handsome amount every day. ECommerce is very easy to capture world market. But your local shop can maximum able to sell the product for local customers only. Not applicable for global customers. Just you need to promote the site. Our charges for making that application is one time only where for shop rent are going on for every month /year base. Even there is a chance to hike. I more benefit of ecommerce is save your useless expenditure. Like for running a shop at least need 2-3 service man/woman.1 who will able to interact with clients, one who tell about the product price and benefits with features and one who will keep records about selling amount the cashier. And your presence s your shop is must to find that all of them doing the right work or not, But for a shopping cart/ecommerce website you do not need any extra hand to keep these sales record. Not an cashier because your money will come directly to your bank. No sales person as there is no shop and all prices are listed there. All products details are in your application. So not need any specialist to describe the product details. We are also known as a best well known ecommerce development india company.
In India there is very less company who provide the best shopping cart solutions with all kind of facility. Our developed system runs for last 4 years for our clients without any hazards. E commerce development needs a hard concept of security and seo friendly. If your site seo friendly then lot of search terms will come automatically if you not even try to hire any seo service provider. For shopping cart the most important part is the security. All are money game here. Transaction, product all are related to money or amount. If your system not good. Hacking can be done and your data can be loose. But our system will never face that kind of problem and it makes your self free of tension. Both ways we are in loss. As we give you high quality application in very reasonable amount. And on the other hand you always a gainer. But our main motive is to capture a huge market of ecommerce development india.
For any customer e commerce is too much favorite because they know not required their physical presence to buy a product. They can compare any product with other product multiple times for their consolation and satisfaction. Not time consuming takes a min to buy a product even. and as they purchase through credit card normally so their cost amount will normally divided into small EMI (as more or less all credit card company provide that kind of facilities) which is easy for them to purchase. Even they can buy a product from Australia (any spcial product which only available in Australia) from usa , without visit to Australia.
Be safe also from any robbery, theft. As e-commerce is help to send the money from clients account to your account directly using payment gateway and debit/credit card so no chance to keep amount in a cash box like a shop. On the other hand in a shop if some sales happen the amount goes to chaser box. Where there is a chance to theft / robbery anytime. Our application is very easy to provide all that kind of features and facilities.
However, if you want a full-featured online store that can process credit card transactions in ""real time"" in a secure environment you will need:
Shopping cart software
Internet-ready merchant account

"How to Show Inertia and Gravity in Flash CS5 Animation with Easing
In Adobe Flash Creative Suite 5, you can reproduce the two most recognizable forces of motion, inertia and gravity, by using a special tween option: Ease. The new animation engine makes lots of easing behaviors available, including Bounce, Spring, Ease In (speed up), Ease Out (slow down), and more. You can assign easing to any tween span with the Motion Editor.
Add easing to a Flash CS5 symbol
To create an easing behavior, follow these steps:
Create a new Flash document. Select the Oval tool and create a perfect circle at the bottom of the stage.
Hold down the Shift key to constrain the circle while you draw it.
With the new circle selected, press F8; when the Convert to Symbol dialog box appears, choose Graphic from the Type drop-down list and enter a name for the symbol in the Name text box.
In this example, we named the circle Ball.
Right-click (Windows) or Control-click (Mac) the first frame of the layer and choose Create Motion Tween from the contextual menu that appears.
A new tween span is created, and the playhead advances to the last frame of the tween span.
Using the Selection tool, select and move the symbol straight to the top of the stage while preserving its horizontal position.
Drag the symbol slowly toward the top of the stage to keep it from shifting left or right. The Snap to Objects behavior keeps the symbol aligned with its original horizontal position until you release it.
Press Enter or Return to preview the animation.
The ball should now move from the bottom to the top of the stage.
Click directly on the tween span on the Timeline to select it and then click the Motion Editor’s panel tab to bring it forward.
You see the various properties of your tween represented on the Motion Editor panel.
Scroll to the bottom of the Motion Editor, locate the Eases row, and change the Simple (slow) value from 0 to 100.
You can click and drag over the value to change it, or double-click and enter a value by hand.
You see that the default Simple (slow) ease is already listed. You can add other types of eases to use later, but for now the default works fine.
Changing the value creates an ease out, which slows the animation as it comes to completion.
Scroll to the top of the Motion Editor and locate the Basic Motion row; directly to the right, choose Simple (slow) from the drop-down list.
This step applies the ease to the motion properties of your tween.
Press Enter or Return to play back and preview your animation.
The animation slows down gradually as it reaches completion.
Reverse the easing in Flash CS5
What goes up must come down, so the following steps walk you through making the Ball return to the ground:
Click the Timeline tab and then click directly on the layer anywhere within the tween span to select the entire motion tween.
Right-click (Windows) or Control-click (Mac) the selected frames to open the contextual menu and then choose Copy Frames.
On the same layer, select the next empty frame immediately after the tween span ends.
To paste the tween you copied in Step 2, make sure that the frame is selected, right-click (Windows) or Control-click (Mac), and choose Paste Frames from the contextual menu that appears.
Click the newly pasted tween span to select it.
To flip the tween backward, right-click (Windows) or Control-click (Mac) the selected frames and choose Reverse Keyframes from the contextual menu that appears.
Press Enter or Return to preview your animation.
The ball goes up and then down, and conveniently the animation is not only reversed but is also easing.
Use easing with Flash CS5 IK animation
Just as with motion tweens, you can mimic the forces of gravity and inertia using easing with IK animations. Although the Motion Editor isn’t available for posed animation, you can easily add easing behavior from the Property inspector to give your IK animation a more realistic look and feel.
Follow these steps to add easing to an Armature layer:
Click and select the first frame of an existing IK Armature layer on the Timeline.
Locate the Ease options on the right side of the Property inspector — the default value is set to zero (no ease) — and then click and drag to change the value to 100 (Ease Out).
(Optional) Select another type of ease from the Type drop-down list.
Press Enter or Return to view the animation.
You see the easing change the behavior of your animation.",en,reference
"by Bob Mackreth
Shunning human contact, the brooding, bearded man retreated to the woods, hiding himself away in a tiny cabin devoid of comforts. No one knew for sure what private demons pursued him- some said that he nursed a wounded heart, others hinted that he hoarded an ill-gotten treasure. Many thought him uncouth, but others described him as a gentleman, well educated. Just about everyone agreed it was best to keep far away from him, though. ""He was sullen and ugly,"" one writer recalls, ""and on several occasions it is said that he used his gun to drive away unwelcome meddlers."" He refused to pay taxes, and once greeted a visiting sheriff with a loaded rifle.
A character from today's headlines? No, the long-ago hermit of Hermit Island.
The tale of the Hermit is a story filled with violence, romance, and wealth. Or maybe not- it's hard to say. You see, since there was nothing written about the Hermit during his lifetime, writers and tale spinners over the ensuing century-and-a-half have felt free to make things up as they went along. As one writer confessed, ""There are a number of different versions to this tale. The author has chosen the one which most appealed to him.""
The Hermit's name was William Wilson or maybe it wasn't. Some accounts claim that his name was anything but Wilson, and that the pseudonym concealed a dark past.
""Nothing is known of his early life,"" says one writer, ""He came from no one knew where."" Not so, says another: ""He was born in Canada of Scottish parents,"" confidently adding that the year was 1792, and the place was Sault Ste. Marie.
Most sources agree that Wilson was a fur trader in his youth, and roamed the mountains as far as the Pacific Ocean. Tiring of the wandering life, one account tells how he walked cross-country, hoping to return to the land of his birth. Arriving there, he found his parents dead, his former sweetheart married.
It seems that few writers could resist the temptation to place a woman at the center of the Hermit's story. An 1890's account describes a mysterious moment:
One day a friend found him sleeping beside the cabin. He did not disturb him. But out of his dreams he awoke, and in an agonizing cry he uttered one word ""Estelle!""
Hmmm who might this mysterious lady have been? Perhaps she was a woman wronged: one source says that at the age of 18, ""he ran away from home, deserting a young French girl he was to have married."" Not true, says another account: ""He had a wife and daughter at L'Anse, in upper Michigan, who he took out to the Columbia River and there deserted. Later, repenting of this cruelty, he sought to reclaim them and found they had been murdered.""
Perhaps there was no wife, no French girl, no ""Estelle."" Who can be certain? But surely we must know more about his life once he appeared in the Apostle Islands country! Indeed, the stories do grow more detailed, the tellers more confident. He came to LaPointe in 1841, we are told, and worked as a cooper, or barrel maker. His employer, John Bell, was every bit as fierce as Wilson, and just a bit tougher, it seems. The two men came to blows one day in 1847, and we hear that Bell laid Wilson out with one punch. Humiliated, Wilson vowed he would never stay on an island where he was not the best man, and so loaded a canoe with provisions and set off to an island where no man would ever be his better.
There, on what is now called Hermit Island, Wilson built a log cabin, planted a garden, and raised chickens. To earn a few dollars, he kept up his work as a cooper. Fishermen would stop by to purchase barrels for their catch, but the Hermit did not encourage them to linger. Yet some writers say he had no need to raise cash. They say that on his rare trips to town, he attracted attention by paying for supplies from a purse filled with silver Mexican coins. Others whispered of a store of gold, buried somewhere near his cabin.
Perhaps this rumor of hidden wealth led to the Hermit's death. In 1861, he was found ""dead in his cabin, where he had undoubtedly been murdered evidently by parties in search of his wealth."" There was ""evidence of a violent death struggle, crude furniture broken, the trunk empty, money bags missing.""
""Not exactly,"" says another story: it was whiskey that laid him low. ""Wilson had died of delirium tremens as misshapen monsters appeared against the mud-lined walls of his lonely cabin, he forced his trembling old body to go after them until life wrenched from it in a final, violent convulsion.""
Oh, my! Amid all this embellishment, what do we really know about Wilson the hermit? We can be confident that he did exist- that in the decade before the Civil War, a tormented man spent his declining years all but shut-off from human society on a lonely island in Lake Superior. Beyond that, it seems that the Hermit will forever remain a man of mystery.
One suspects he would have preferred it that way.

The proliferation of “free” training and audits is highly reminiscent of the early days of IAQ work. Unnecessary remediation after a “mold inspection” became so iconic, in fact, it was not only reported on in major news outlets, it also was parodied on the animated series “King of the Hill.” It has taken that industry a lot of time, dedication, consumer education, and hard work to overcome the biases created in those early days.
In some markets, IAQ inspections became mandated for home sales and insurance purposes. Some inspectors were less scrupulous than others, using scare tactics and referring work to essentially their own company. Thanks to diligence of groups like the IAQ Association, there are codes of conduct and a collection of recommended remediation practices, plus a great deal of common sense.
The energy audit trend, thank heavens, does not have any associated health risks to shoot itself in the foot with in the form of scare tactics. But many marketers are latching onto the already saturated green trend. Others are working with specific companies, like those that produce siding, insulation, and windows. There is a real risk of losing consumer confidence with a combination of heavy-handed marketing, poor quality, and unmet consumer expectations.
HVAC AUDITSThat should not prevent HVAC contractors from getting involved with energy audit work, but they need to proceed with thorough preparation to make sure their customer satisfaction remains intact. With HVAC systems being among the largest energy consumers in virtually all buildings, it makes sense for these contractors to either become trained (by a reputable trainer) in performing energy audits, or to ally themselves with reputable energy auditors.
If you Google “energy audits,” a lot of business opportunities pop up. Take your time with them. It is true that opportunities exist for improvement in nearly all buildings, but if you are going to get involved in this market, do your homework. After all, you will need to provide some education to your customers, as well as your staff. And be prepared for the investments in both training and equipment that proper entry into this market requires.
Check with your local trade group to see if they are hearing about reputable energy audit training and certification, or auditors to partner with. Ask friendly competitors for their feedback. Ask your supplier. Beware of “free” certification.
THE DUCTWORKIf your business plan does not include broadening your scope to include whole-house energy audits or improvements, top to bottom - which is the kind of shift in focus HVAC contractors need to make if they are going to expand into total energy work - you can at least do yourself a favor by stretching just a little bit into the ventilation system. That work should not go to anyone else but you, in all honesty.
However, do not try to couple it with an “energy audit” and just offer this one solution. That would make you no better than the window and insulation salesmen. Do promote it as exactly what it is: an HVAC audit. Explain that this is a major source of energy improvements, as well as comfort.
You really need to learn how to detect and repair duct leaks. Do it now. If nothing else, your customers are becoming aware that their homes are systems; it will not be a stretch for them to comprehend that the box and the ductwork are part of the same system. Consider partnering with a reputable energy auditor who does not have your expertise.
They are looking for solutions to their energy needs. Whatever you offer them, do it the best you can. If you can present solutions that are thorough, with measurable results (and repairing the ductwork will have these), everybody wins.

"BAHIR DAR, AMHARA REGION, ETHIOPIA, November 2, 2010 – Today a group of Lions led by Lions Clubs International President Sid L. Scruggs III joined with partners to launch MalTra, a week-long combined treatment campaign aimed at controlling both malaria and trachoma. The antibiotic, Zithromax®, donated by program partner Pfizer Inc, is a critical part of Lions and partners’ strategy in the fight against the blinding disease in underdeveloped, rural areas.
“As Lions, we are passionate about eliminating preventable blindness, and through SightFirst we dream to see and end of this debilitating disease,” said Scruggs. “Strong partnerships are essential to successfully tackling public health problems at this magnitude and the strong partnership among Lions, The Carter Center, the Amhara Regional Health Bureau, the International Trachoma Initiative and Pfizer is invaluable.”
During the first MalTra week in November 2008, 4.8 million people were treated. Since then, the campaign has been conducted every six months, treating more people and alternating between east and west Amhara. This is the fifth annual MalTra week event. Lions have helped in mobilizing more than 15,000 community volunteers to ensure more than 10 million people in more than 4,500 villages receive twice-annually the drug that will help prevent trachoma as well as protect them against other common infections. At the same time, Lions and partners distributed bed nets to protect against malaria-carrying mosquito bites and will also provide community education on ways to prevent both trachoma and malaria.
President Scruggs and his wife Judy, Past President Jim Ervin and his wife Sharon, Lions of Ethiopia and Lions Clubs International Foundation staff participated in administering the first dose and launching the week-long initiative. Representatives from The Carter Center, the national trachoma program, government of Ethiopia, including the national president and state presidents, the International Trachoma Initiative and Pfizer joined the celebration.
Bahir Dar is located in the most trachoma-endemic area of the country. Together with the Amhara Regional Health Bureau, the international coalition is working to eliminate trachoma as a source of blindness from the region by 2015.
“This campaign is of great significance to us as it targets trachoma and malaria, two major health problems of our communities in Amhara region at an unprecedented scale” said H.E. Ato Ayalew Gobezie, president of the regional state.
A disease caused by bacterial infection, trachoma is the leading cause of preventable blindness worldwide. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), trachoma affects about 84 million people, of whom about 8 million are visually impaired and have lost their sight. Another 500 million are at risk worldwide. It is estimated that there are 1 million Ethiopians suffering from severe trachoma who are at risk of immediate blindness, 600,000 of whom live in Amhara.
“We shouldn’t allow malaria and trachoma to prey on Ethiopian people, destroying lives and jeopardizing the country’s future,” said Dr. John B. Hardman, CEO and president of The Carter Center. “We should do everything possible to support the Ministry of Health scale-up interventions to assist all the people of Ethiopia so that they can realize their full potential free from these devastating diseases.”
Trachoma control is based on the WHO integrated strategy known as SAFE – Surgery, Antibiotics, Facial cleanliness, and Environmental improvement. It is Ethiopia’s goal to eliminate trachoma from Amhara by 2012 for the entire population at risk, around 18 million people. Antibiotics are necessary to reducing trachoma in addition to improved sanitation and hand and face washing.
LCIF has helped distributed more than 42 million doses of Zithromaz to help fight trachoma. This, the fifth MalTra campaign, will be the first time when more than half the people in the region will be treated at once. It will also see the administration of the 225-millionth dose of the antibiotic Zithromax®, donated by Pfizer Inc through the International Trachoma Initiative (ITI) globally. Ethiopia has received 32 percent of the global donation of Zithromax® since the program’s inception, representing an approximate value of US$1.6 billion.
“We are delighted to be part of such an inspiring collaboration and model public health campaign - the latest in our ongoing commitment to eliminate blinding trachoma by 2020,"" said Dr Freda Lewis-Hall, Senior Vice President and Chief Medical Officer, Pfizer Inc. “Like all of the health programs Pfizer is involved in across this region, it’s the strength of the partnership between the organizations and health professionals involved that makes large scale events such as MalTra week possible.”

"As the number of LEED-certified buildings continues to grow, there are also fewer industry “firsts” when it comes to designing a sustainable facility. Nevertheless, the design and construction teams for the Arlington Free Clinic were able to do just that in their pursuit of LEED Gold certification—one level higher than originally specified—making it the first LEED Gold healthcare facility in Arlington County, as well as the first LEED Gold free clinic in the nation.
For Tama Duffy Day, national interior design healthcare leader with Perkins+Will, the Arlington Free Clinic provided the opportunity for her firm to combine sustainable design concepts with the principles of evidence-based design—previously the province of hospitals and patient rooms—in some unique ways.
The completed facility, which takes its inspiration from a flower by surrounding a community-based “core” with four essential clinic functions, demonstrates that evidence-based design can succeed outside of more formal medical settings. The facility makes use of numerous evidence-based strategies, such as allowing for increased levels of natural light in the clinic’s waiting room, incorporating a sink in every exam room to reduce the possibility of infection and laying out the facility’s areas, including a nurse station and pharmacy, in a straightforward way that improves wayfinding and reduces stress.
Sustainable features are similarly intertwined in the clinic’s concept, and a few of the efficiencies realized include:
- A reduction of water usage by 30 percent
- A reduction of energy usage by 40 percent, thanks to an efficient
HVAC system, all while providing better indoor air quality
- The recycling of more than 85 percent of all construction waste, and
the banning of materials with volatile organic compounds (VOCs) on
the job site
- The use of regionally manufactured products (47 percent) and furniture
Part of the clinic’s LEED certification also resulted from innovation credits received for the usage of 25 signage plaques around the clinic, aimed at educating volunteers and patients about sustainable design.
The results of the clinic’s transformation affirm the concept of evidence-based design, as supported through research. In a post-occupancy survey of staff, 100 percent agreed that the new space is light-filled and uplifting; 79 percent thought that more community activities and education will occur as a result of the new conference space; and 72 percent agreed that the new space “inspires health.”",en,reference
"STX OSV Holdings Limited, one of the major global designers and shipbuilders of offshore and specialized vessels, announces that the platform supply vessel Far Solitaire, built by STX OSV Langsten in Norway for owners Farstad Supply, was elected Ship of the Year 2012.
The annual Ship of the Year award recognizes outstanding vessels delivered from a Norwegian yard, and is instituted by major Norwegian shipping magazine Skipsrevyen.
Far Solitaire, of Rolls-Royce’s UT 754WP design, is a chemical tanker compliant supply vessel according to IBC code 2, which was the main reason for the jury to elect this vessel as Ship of the Year 2012. The technologically advanced vessel
has been developed by Farstad Shipping in close co-operation with Rolls-Royce Marine and is the first PSV of this type ever built. Delivery will take place from STX OSV Langsten in October.
STX OSV first announced the contract for this newbuild on 18 November 2010 as part of an agreement to build four vessels for Farstad Shipping. The Group currently has eleven vessels under construction for this long-standing client.
This year’s award marks the seventh time since 2000 that a vessel built by STX OSV has been awarded the title Ship of the Year. In 2009, the Multifunctional Plough/Tug/Supply/Subsea Service Vessel Far Samson, also delivered from STX OSV Langsten to Farstad Shipping, won the coveted prize.

"But there is another game that publishers and authors sometimes play that is every bit as dishonest as a tainted review: the use of meaningless book blurbs written by friends who trade rave blurbs about each others' books in an attempt to increase sales for both. We've all seen them, and seasoned readers learn to recognize them for what they are pretty quickly, but they probably do work more times than not. The New York Times Sunday Book Review talks about the practice in today's issue:
The endorsements on books aren’t entirely impartial. Unbeknownst to the average reader, blurbs are more often than not from the writer’s best friends, colleagues or teachers, or from authors who share the same editor, publisher or agent. They represent a tangled mass of friendships, rivalries, favors traded and debts repaid, not always in good faith. There’s some debate about whether blurbs actually help sell books, but publishers agree they can’t hurt. Often, agents try to solicit blurbs even before a publisher buys a book....
For writers, to blurb or not to blurb can be a tricky matter. Blurb too little and you’ll have a hard time drumming up the requisite superlatives when your turn comes. Blurb too often, or include too many blurbs on your book, and you might get called a blurb whore.The article goes on to separate ""blurbing"" into the three subsets of ""blurbing down,"" ""blurbing up,"" and ""lateral blurbing,"" all based on the industry reputation of the author providing the dust jacket quote. Blurbing up occurs when a lesser known writer provides a blurb for an author better known than himself (something he will jump at the chance to do, of course), blurbing down is the opposite (and, I suspect, is the source of the most honest blurbs being used), and blurbing laterally is likely to be the source of countless back-scratching blurbs that are especially meaningless.
Whatever you think about blurbs, and whether or not they influence you in the least, this is an interesting article. Take a look.",en,web

"How should doctors respond when civilians become targets in war? A serious recent example is the gratuitous Russian annihilation of the Chechen capital, Grozny. And Israel has just vented its impatience by breaking agreed (and UN-monitored) terms of engagement with Syrian-backed Hizbollah guerrillas in Israeli-occupied southern Lebanon. That 1996 agreement—reached after Israeli operations had left 160 civilians dead and 340 injured—is now in tatters. At least 17 Lebanese civilians were injured in the latest Israeli raids.
The most well-researched instance of disregard for civilian safety was revealed last week in a report published by Human Rights Watch on the 1999 NATO air campaign in former Yugoslavia. At the time, NATO officials emphasised their wish to limit civilian casualties. However, the Human Rights Watch report concluded that during the 78-day bombing campaign, 500 Yugoslav civilians were killed in at least 90 incidents. Although legitimate military locations were targeted in most cases, nine attacks were directed at non-military targets—Serb radio and television headquarters, a heating plant, and seven bridges that did not provide vital transportation routes. Of the attacks on military installations, 33 took place in heavily populated urban areas where civilian casualties were likely.
The use of cluster bombs by the USA and UK was an especially deadly aspect of the air campaign, accounting for up to 150 civilian fatalities. After one NATO cluster-bomb incident that went badly wrong in May, 1999 (in Nis, including hits on a health centre and near a pathology building), there were 14 civilian deaths. The US government secretly ordered its forces to cease using these weapons. However, British military commanders continued to use cluster bombs. Why were cluster bombs deemed so essential? Because they were, according to this new report, “part of a psychological warfare strategy of harassment undertaken without regard to the greater risk to the civilian population”. Human Rights Watch concluded “that NATO violated international humanitarian law”.
The effects of targeting civilian populations fall directly on local health services. For example, the 1996 conflict in south Lebanon produced injuries that had serious, and frequently forgotten, long-term consequences. Early relief efforts did provide valuable aid to these casualties, but much needed additional rehabilitative medical services were often missing (J Epidemiol Community Health 2000; 54: 35-39). Doctors have an important advocacy role in bringing the needs of those affected by war to the attention of politicians.
There is another role for health workers and, again, the fields of Yugoslavia provide the evidence. The WHO Regional Office for Europe's Peace Through Health programme, designed in collaboration with the UK's Department for International Development, aims to use medicine as a direct means to reconciliation. Their report, published last year, finds that “the health sector has been the most progressive in terms of reconciliation”. How so?
The idea, conceived in March, 1997, was simple: to promote cooperation between governments and local populations on matters of health policy. Projects among the different ethnic communities of Bosnia and Herzegovina included: promotion of primary and mental health services; tuberculosis control; anti-tobacco policies; and provision of children's dental health. This work is impressive. WHO's report argues that, “For WHO, to view contributions to peace-building as extraneous to our technical role is at best myopic, at worst negligent”.
Doctors have a vital role in the prevention of conflict, as well as in the care and cure of its consequences. The only remaining argument is the limit of the preventive reach of public health. One new sphere of influence has already opened up. WHO has, through its Commission on Macroeconomics and Health, made economics a central strand in its strategy for sustainable development.
But physicians also have individual parts to play. It is, after all, the individual alone who can lead, act, or persuade. And here one arrives at the ultimate political and economic risk to the public's health—namely, the sale of weapons between nations. The tragic irony of the latest Israeli-Lebanese conflict is that Israeli soldiers were probably killed by American missiles originally supplied by Israel to Iran. Cold logic thus insists that doctors must oppose this grotesque traffic in human misery. And they must do it now.",en,academic
"LAWRENCE — Police arrested a city resident for endangering the life of a tow truck driver early Sunday morning.
Francisco Henriquez, of 61 Berkeley St., was charged with disturbing the peace and assault by means of a dangerous weapon after he attempted to drive his car away while the tow truck driver was underneath the vehicle, according to police.
“The victim related to me that he saw the tires rotating near his face and got scared that he was going to get run over by the suspect’s vehicle,” Officer Ivan Melendez wrote in his report.
“The victim further stated he was drenched in slush and snow from the tires kicking snow on his face and body. The victim then got out from underneath the vehicle and made his way to safety,” the officer said.
Wardy Castillo, the tow truck driver, told police that he was actually trying to unhook the vehicle in order to return it to the owner. Local tow truck companies had been ordered by police to return vehicles if the owners came out in time to move the vehicles during the recent storm.

"New Delhi: May 30, 2012
Cronje has often been hailed as a brilliant leader of men who lost just 11 of his 53 Tests as captain and won 99 of the 138 one-day internationals at the helm between 1994 and 2000.
But the man who inspired thousands in post-apartheid South Africa showed his ugly side in 2000 when he admitted to accepting bribes from illegal bookmakers to influence matches.
Cronje testified before South Africa's government-appointed King Commission probing corruption in cricket that his ""great passion of the game and for my team-mates"" was matched by ""an unfortunate love of money"".
Cronje was banned from the game for life in October, 2000, six months after New Delhi police accused him of taking money from bookie Sanjeev Chawla during his team's Indian tour that year.
Two years later, on June 1, 2002, he was dead aged 32 when a light plane in which he was travelling crashed into the mountains near the South African coastal town of George in bad weather.
Cape Town judge Siraj Desai, who conducted an inquest into the crash, blamed the two dead pilots for the tragedy, saying they failed to follow correct procedures for a missed landing approach.
At the time of his death, Cronje was working as a financial manager with a firm that dealt in earth-moving machinery, a far cry from the days when he strode world cricket like a colossus.
A born-again Christian, Cronje initially denied any wrongdoing, but later became the first cricketer to publicly admit his involvement with corrupt bookmakers.
Two former Test captains, Salim Malik of Pakistan and Mohammad Azharuddin of India, who were also banned for life by their respective boards following a probe by India's Central Bureau of Invesigation (CBI), have consistently denied any role in match-fixing.
But the menace just refuses to go away despite the International Cricket Council pouring millions of dollars into its Anti-Corruption and Security Unit (ACSU) to check malpractices in the sport.
West Indies all-rounder Marlon Samuels was banned for two years in 2008 for allegedly passing on match-related information to an Indian bookie during his team's one-day series in India the previous year.
In 2010, two Essex cricketers, Pakistani international Danish Kaneria and Mervyn Westfield, were hauled up on spot-fixing charges following an investigation into betting irregularities in county cricket - Westfield was to be jailed earlier this year.
Worse, three Pakistani stars -- Test captain Salman Butt and fast bowlers Mohammad Aamer and Mohammad Asif -- were jailed last year after being found guilty of spot-fixing during the 2010 Lord's Test against England.
It was the first time international cricketers were handed prison sentences, a scandal described by outgoing ICC chief executive Haroon Lorgat as the worst corruption case since the Cronje episode.
Recently, five Indian first-class players were suspended from the game pending an investigation over a TV sting operation that alleged corruption in domestic matches, including the popular Indian Premier League.
Cricket's dark underbelly, plagued by underworld match-fixing gangs who reportedly bet millions of dollars at virtually every match, remains a constant threat to the sport.
India, cricket's financial powerhouse which accounts for nearly 70 percent of the game's global revenues, is regarded as the hotbed for betting syndicates and match-fixers.
Betting on sports is illegal in India except at horse races, but gambling laws are so lax that offenders sometimes get away by paying a paltry fine of just 200 rupees (approx US$4).
""Unless the betting industry is brought under control in India, you can't stop match-fixing,"" former ICC chief Ehsan Mani of Pakistan said recently.
""There's no doubt that India, certainly Delhi and Mumbai, is the epicentre of cricket betting.""
The powerful Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) last month set up a new domestic anti-corruption bureau to tackle the problem, the fourth board to have an independent ACU unit after Australia, Pakistan and England.
India's ACU is being headed by former police office Ravi Sawani, who worked for a few years as the chief investigator of the ICC's own anti-corruption body. (AFP)",en,reference

"In the recently adopted revisions to the Prawer Plan, which would forcibly relocate up to 70,000 Bedouins in the Negev, Israeli Knesset Member Benny Begin attempts to distract attention from the overtly racist tone of the original plan proposed in 2011. Instead of characterising Bedouins, whose impoverished communities are scattered across the vast Negev, as illegal squatters, foreign invaders and land robbers, Begin's report coolly asserts the mutual advantage the Prawer Plan will have on Jewish and Bedouin communities alike.
Disregarding the fact that Bedouins have uniformly rejected the Prawer Plan, Begin writes:
""It is the government's responsibility to take action in order to enable the Bedouins to extricate themselves from these circumstances and to grant them, and particularly the younger generation the tools necessary to successfully cope with the challenges of the future.""
The language of benevolence and goodwill decorates Begin's 16-page report and disguises the Plan's actual intention of displacement as one of ""development"". At least 44,000 Bedouin citizens of Israel will be displaced from their homes if the plan goes forward.
Attempts to prettify Israel's land-grabbing policies are not new, but have metamorphosed over time. Once the Jewish National Fund's tree-planting project greenwashed the expropriation of Palestinian land; today, promises of egalitarian progress through joint industrial zones and a blossoming private sector accompany the Zionist project in the Negev.
Today's rhetoric, embodied in Begin's report, reflects the trend in Israel to ""privatise Zionism"", a phrase Neve Gordon and Erez Tzfadia coined in 2007 when writing about the proliferation of private security firms manning checkpoints in the West Bank and demolishing Bedouin villages in the Negev, as well as the increasing presence of real estate moguls developing the land from which Bedouins had been expelled.
Efforts to Judaise the Negev
In 2009, the Israel Land Administration enacted a law that would privatise historically state-owned land that had been expropriated from Palestinians expelled from their homes in the Nakba of 1948. In an interview in 2010, Shir Hever explained to me that the timing of the above land reform bill, ""coincide[d] with the very deep shift within Israel from a republican, strong-state model of an ultra-nationalist welfare state, into a new model of neoliberalism, while still keeping the ultra-nationalism"".
Zionists' pursuit of the Negev has a long, if failed, history. Israeli leaders have always regarded the Negev as an alluring, but vexing, frontier - a canvas for ""pure Zionism"" as Daniel Mattio, chairman of the Chicago Israeli Philanthropic Fund, described it in 2008; and a measure of Zionism's vitality, as David Ben-Gurion said: ""The Negev will be the test of the creative ability and pioneering valour of Israel.""
In a definitive historical overview of the various efforts to Judaise the Negev, researcher Rebecca Manski explains that the government began to place them in the hands of private firms in 2006.
That year, the Israeli government allocated $4bn to the private development group, Daroma Idan Hanegev, Ltd, and the American managing consulting giant, McKinsey & Co.
According to Manski, this massive outsourcing was ""unprecedented"" and consisted of a two-tiered approach that ""involv[ed] the removal of unrecognised Bedouin villages on the one hand, and incorporation and construction of new Jewish towns on the other"".
""Israeli leaders have always regarded the Negev as an alluring, but vexing, frontier - a canvas for 'pure Zionism'… and a measure of Zionism's vitality.""
A couple of years earlier, in 2004, Haim Blumenblat, the CEO of Daroma, joined Ben Gurion University president, Avishay Braverman on a JNF panel discussion at the annual Herzliya Conference, during which they rallied around the JNF's attempts to revamp stalled efforts to Judaise and ""develop"" the Negev.
Blumenblat declared: ""We need to build new communities and develop young leadership that can implement this vision.""
Speaking with less tact but decidedly more honesty, Braverman qualified what Blumenblat meant by ""vision"" and ""new communities"": ""If Zionism is a motivating force, then it needs to travel south to the Negev, so that Israel does not turn into a Palestinian state. If we follow this model, I believe there will be a breakthrough.""
The model Braverman refers to takes form in Blumenblat's ""Negev 2015"" or ""Plan Daroma"", which, according to Daroma's 2005 slideshow, views private development as the surest way to ""improve the quality of life which will attract people and businesses to the area"". The first step toward creating such prosperity is to remove ""barriers to economic development (eg, bureaucracy)"".
Like Begin's Prawer Plan, ""Negev 2015"" also presents itself as simply an egalitarian enterprise, promising improved infrastructure in the dilapidated Bedouin townships with more opportunities for businesses and employment for everyone. Meanwhile, the plan dedicates 1.2 billion NIS to Jewish settlements while overseeing the wanton destruction of so-called unrecognised Bedouin communities that have made their home in the Negev for hundreds of years - without the assistance of massive government subsidies.
So far, the only proposal Daroma and Begin have come up with to relieve unemployment and poverty among the deliberately destabilised population of Bedouins in the Negev is through joint ""Jewish-Bedouin"" industrial zones. Modelled on the industrial zones, Israel has established inside settlements in the Occupied West Bank, businesses receive ample incentives to establish factories in these zones where exploitation of workers is rampant.
Factories on occupied land
Take, for instance, SodaStream, the company that has marketed itself as providing a solution to the extravagant waste produced by bottled water and sodas, while it seeks to downplay its rivalling reputation as a profiteer of Israel's occupation of Palestine. SodaStream, a prominent target of the BDS campaign, has placed its main factory in illegal settlement Ma'ale Adumim's industrial park, Mishor Edomim.
Why did SodaStream establish its flagship factory inside an illegal settlement? According to Peter Wiseburgh, the founder of the company, the decision was not political, but economic. ""It was a good deal. Not a political act.""
To be sure, the Government of Israel lures businesses to set up shop in settlements by offering low rent, tax incentives and a lenient enforcement of environmental and labour protection laws, while presenting these endeavours to the outside world as providing the local population with a ""hub for co-existence and a bridge for peace"", in the words of Knesset Speaker Ruby Rivlin.
In reality, industrial zones like Mishor Edomim are more accurately described as exploitation zones, where the most vulnerable workers trade their labour for a little cash. Kav LaOved, an Israeli workers' rights organisation, has consistently reported that SodaStream pays Palestinian workers substandard wages, subjects them to poor working conditions and fires them at any sign of protest.
Yes, establishing a factory on occupied land provides capitalists very ""good deals"", indeed.
It's no wonder then that SodaStream accepted a 25 million NIS grant from Israel's Investment Promotion Centre to build its next plant within Israel's Green Line, in the Idan Industrial Zone of the Negev, which will function in much the same way as settlement industrial parks like Mishor Edomim. According to the director of the IPC, SodaStream chose the industrial zone in the Negev - over many other options - because of the alluring tax cuts the State of Israel offered it. Doubtless, the promise of reduced ""bureaucracy"" (read: worker and environmental protections) makes the deal that much sweeter.
As Israel throws billions of dollars into making the Negev a place where ""people want to live"", there are tens of thousands of people who live there now and would prefer to remain - without the interference of state-driven, predatory capitalism armed with bulldozers and demolition orders.

"This is my hair untouched. It looks like this if I wash it and leave it alone. Sometimes it's nice to have a break from all the heat.
I picked these shorts up this weekend at The Melrose Trading Post market. There's a denim 'cut offs' stall there that is amazing. I get all my vintage levis from that market. For those of you not in LA I've found some equally as good rainbow shorts HERE & HERE. I think I'll be wearing mine a LOT this summer :)

Good idea to block all vonage, mortgage ads? sirkei msg:1575963 4:34 am on Nov 13, 2005 (gmt 0) Hi,
I was wondering whether its a good idea to block all vonage, mortgage ads? Since YPN targetting is so bad, would it be a good idea to block all ads in order to increase the targetting?
Yesmom said she is getting more targetted ads blocking all these. So should we block all of them? Not even letting one survive?
sirkei msg:1575964 5:16 am on Nov 13, 2005 (gmt 0)
Ok, some updates after blocking those certain ads. I see more targetted ads. I guess YPn has the inventory. But some florist.com ads are still appearing. I blocked florist.com but florist.com/floristcom is showing up.
Erm, anyone knows how to block the entire domain?

"Efforts to incorporate Bowmanstown as a borough occurred as early as 1892. The village contained about 300 inhabitants in 1896 but the nearby New Jersey Zinc Company soon added to its growth. Bowmanstown was incorporated as a Borough on November 29, 1913 for the purpose of providing general local government services to residents of the community. Upon incorporation of Bowmanstown as a borough its boundaries encompassed lands measuring 0.75 square mile. The borough's assessed valuation in 1918 was $279,000.00. The population of 834 in 1920 remained relatively constant for decades. The Bowmanstown Borough Municipal Building (Borough Hall) is a converted school building that was constructed in 1903 to serve the youths of the community. In 1958, the Palmerton School District was established and combined several local schools in order to create a regional school thus making the Bowmanstown campus obsolete. In 1964, the Borough acquired the old brick school building and has been using it as offices ever since. The borough kept the building in its original condition.
The Bowmanstown Borough Authority was incorporated August 24, 1997 and was created for the purpose of owning and operating the Bowmanstown Public Water System. On February 11, 2002 the Authority began construction of its water system improvement project which included a new chlorine building, looping numerous water mains, installing new services, erection of a new 250,000 gallon Standpipe and a new liner to the one Reservoir. In 2009, the Authority replaced their two roofs at the Reservoirs with metal roofs. Ongoing water projects will continue to transpire throughout the years.",en,reference

"SAGN is open. We had a glorious show for a very appreciative Portland audience, who clapped wildly at “The Great Northwest – where it is in him for a man to be as big and important as it is in him to be.” It was fun and well-deserved. We partied at the Armory, the Life of Reilly, and a club in Southeast that I couldn’t tell you where it was. I slept through my first train, and made the second one.
My year of assistant directing is complete. On Thursday, when Aaron gave the last of the notes, I felt something slipping away from me, like taking off a jacket. It’s over.
I’m celebrating in Canada. Arrived by train from Portland and bus from Seattle yesterday, for the first vacation in 4 years. Staying with Krist3l and MiQ. Drum and bass and a fake Halloween party last night, breakfast this morning with a Vancouver actor named James – the world of theater is as big as a postage stamp, and that stamp travels to every city in the world. We talked about audiences and locations and all the same old things. It feels like home, but everywhere does now.",en,books
"So, people have been e-mailing, asking what adventure Ben and I did yesterday afternoon, I guess I made it out to seem to be a more exciting than it actually was, it's my life here people, it's not like President Obama came over for lunch!
Anyway, Ben and I both have bicycles that are in desperate needs of a tune up, and it just hasn't happened this summer to due to the time to get them there, the money to tune them up after the wedding, and a million other excuses. However, yesterday Ben was hankering for a bike ride, so he suggested we try out the new Rental Bikes available in Minneapolis. Because of my hip issues, I told him I couldn't bike, but I'd gladly come along on my rollerblades.
So, we headed to Uptown, and picked up a bike at one of the many rental kiosks around the city. The program is called Nice Ride Minnesota, and it's pretty easy to use. Insert your credit card, get a printed out code, use that code to unlock the bike, and take off.
You can return the bike to any of the stations they have around the city (currently in Uptown, Downtown and the U of M area) and be charged on a daily or half-hourly basis.
Greenway yesterday to put on some good mileage, and the bike worked great! It wasn't a piece of crap, it was easy for him to ride, and equally easy to return just by locking it back into one of their bike racks. He even rode to the Twins Stadium (yes, you can bike to a Twins game, great way to save money on parking and burn off those hot dog calories before you have them!), while I turned around a bit earlier to be extra careful with my hip injury (the joys!).
I'm so impressed that Minneapolis has taken this initiative to have these affordable and reliable bikes available to the general public. It really shows the initiative this city has to keep people healthy, and also cut down on the number of cars on the street. I wish that more cities would do this, as it's simple things like that that make communities healthier, improve a person's quality of life, and cut down on health care costs for all of us.
Have you tried these rental bikes? If you're outside of the Twin Cities, does your city do something similar?",en,web
"DALLAS - Telling identical twins apart is not easy.
Lincoln high school juniors Erick and Derrick Neal don't make it any easier.
""Basically we have the same face,"" Erick said as the two stood side-by-side for our interview.
""We just have different haircuts,"" Derrick said. ""And you can see he has a birthmark on his face,"" said Derrick, pointing to a spot next to Erick's left eye. ""And I don't have it.""
Erick wears No. 3, both in basketball and football. Derrick wears No. 2 for football, and No. 4 for basketball. They were first and second in touchdowns scored for the football team, which went 7-0 in district -- Erick was the quarterback, Derrick a wide receiver.
Now, they are the leading scorers for the basketball team, which has a 7-0 record in district play.
""Most basketball fans would always say, you need guard play,"" said Lincoln's head basketball coach Leonard Bishop. ""And then when you have two guards who play the way they play, it makes it so much simpler.""
I'm a twin myself -- fraternal, not identical -- and growing up, everyone wanted to compare us, while we just wanted to be different. Erick and Derrick are identical and they embrace their similarities.
""Actually, I like being a twin; we like being the same,"" Derrick said. ""It's like a good opportunity to have a twin who's like the same as you.""
They also plan to play their college ball together in a couple years, and while they are interchangeable at the guard positions, Derrick primarily plays point guard, Erick is a shooting guard.
""I want it to be fast-tempo,"" Derrick said, when talking about what kind of program he hopes to play for in college.
""I think we're going to pick a college that fits our play,"" Erick said. ""Open court, screens, fast-tempo.""
And because they're a package deal, college coaches won't have to worry about mixing them up while recruiting; just go after both of them.",en,unknown
"Saucy redheaded minx Emma Stone appears to spread her legs in the disgusting nude photo above.
As if being a redhead wasn’t offensive enough, Emma Stone now has to disrespect Islam further by showing off her sinful nude female body.
No doubt imams from Kabul to Baghdad will be closely studying this Emma Stone nude photo to determine Islam’s response to this egregious affront. However, insiders have already indicated that she will soon be known as Emma Stoned.
It looks as though the inevitable has finally happened and actresses Emma Stone, Emma Roberts, and Emma Watson were caught in an all Emma lesbian orgy.
Having the same first name as another actress is really more than enough reason to have lesboqueer relations in heathen Hollywood. I imagine the conversation was something along the lines of “Hey we are all named Emma lets tongue each others f*ck boxes”.
Yes Emma Stone, Emma Roberts, and Emma Watson were clearly destined to have a dyke fest. It is just a shame Allah didn’t smite them all right then and there, but it is understandable as he was probably too nauseated from the scene.
Actress and soulless ginger Emma Stone appears to be spreading her legs while naked in the photo above.
Allah in his infinite wisdom curses extremely lecherous women (like Emma Stone) with red hair, so that they will be easy to spot and hurl rocks at.
Of course now that Emma Stone has posed naked she will become an even greater target for our righteous Islamic stones of justice, so she will have nowhere to hide when Islam conquers the West.
In a desperate attempt to get taken to Poundtown by a virile Muslim man, Emma Stone is running the above commercial throughout the Islamic world.
Of course Emma Stone is a fool and will never get sexed by a Muslim after running an ad like this. In fact the only banging she is likely to receive from us Muslims will be from the banging of rocks off of her insolent infidel head if she continues to pursue our enormous Islamic dongs in such an aggressive manner.
Emma Stone needs to realize that us Muslims are not like the limp-dicked homoqueer Jews she is use to in the heathen US of A. We are strong manly men who require women show us the utmost respect before we grace their sinful lady holes with our powerful giant Islamic flesh swords. Us Muslim men will certainly not be pushed around by a sass-mouthed female like Emma Stone demanding we “bang”.
Following her ginger nature Emma Stone wore a loose fitting open back shirt with no bra, and then waited on a balcony for a gust of wind to come and blow open her shirt exposing her breast.
As it states in the Holy Qur’an, red hair is the mark of a lecherous woman who’s sinful cardinal desires shine through the hair follicles. When confronted with a ginger woman it is best to stone first and ask questions later, less you be subjected to brazen displays of sexual depravity like the Emma Stone sideboob pictures below.
Only the cleansing power of a righteous stoning can save Emma Stone from further acts of debauchery and almost certain damnation. Let us hope Emma travels to a civilized country like Yemen or Qatar, were gingers are dealt with properly before her slutty ginger ways rear their ugly head again.
Actress and soulless ginger, Emma Stone offends Islam in the bikini pictures below.
As all Muslims know, Allah creates gingers like Emma Stone as a form of punishment for sins in a previous life (like being a Jew or lecherous woman). To pay for these past transgressions, gingers go through life being ridiculed and never feeling the sun on their sinful pasty skin.
However, due to the Jew science of sunblock, gingers like Emma Stone now have the capability to defy Allah’s will and expose their disgusting bodies to the light of day, and that is just what Emma Stone is doing in the bikini pictures below.
What an offense to Islam! If Emma Stone does not want to add a “d” to the end of her last name then she must repent immediately and never wear a bikini again.
In perhaps the funniest move of his career, Jim Carrey recorded a creepy video message for actress Emma Stone telling her how he wants to f*ck her and have fat redhead children with her.
Truly this video is Jim Carrey at his best, staring creepily into an uncomfortably close camera while taking about having sex with a stranger who is 27 years his junior. But don’t take my word for it, see the comedic genius for yourself in the video below.
One can only hope that this is only the beginning of the creepy videos Jim Carrey will be making for Emma Stone. For his next one it would be great if Jim filmed himself slowly masturbating while wearing a red wig and applying thick red lipstick. He could talk about how sexy Emma Stone makes him feel, before shooting a load unto a “Zombieland” movie poster. That would be hilarious!",en,incoherent
"Peru’s Madre de Dios: carbon-storage test ground
Puerto Maldonado, Peru
Just two years ago, forest lined most of the dirt road from this jungle town westward to the Andean foothills. As paving of the Interoceanic Highway from the Brazilian border to the Pacific coast nears completion, however, cattle pastures and gold mines have advanced in lockstep with the road graders.
Such trends pose a stern test for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (Redd), a concept aimed at allowing industrialized countries to meet greenhouse-gas emissions targets in part by funding forest protection in developing nations.
With deforestation the cause of 17% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions—more than those of the globe’s entire transport sector—Redd is expected to be a high-profile topic at the upcoming United Nations climate conference in Copenhagen. (See Centerpiece—this issue.)",en,reference

When a ""planned care"" system of healthcare delivery was instituted in three primary-care practices in Wisconsin and Minnesota, it resulted in better care by physicians and in better diabetes control for their patients, according to researchers from the Mayo Health System Diabetes Translation Project.
Planned care includes implementation of guidelines for diabetes care, support for self-management and use of clinical information systems. Healthcare providers in this study also used a diabetes electronic management system (DEMS).
After planned care was implemented, improvements were seen in patients' A1C levels, cholesterol levels and measures of microalbuminuria (an indication of kidney disease) as well as in the number of physicians who counseled against tobacco use.
Physicians who used DEMS were more likely to refer patients for testing in all areas, including microalbuminuria, eye exams, foot exams and self-management support.
The researchers report that while planned care itself resulted in improved metabolic control for patients, there was no further impact on metabolic outcomes when DEMS was used, although the electronic management system did result in increased testing for diabetes-related complications.

"CAMP DAVID, md. — President Barack Obama and leaders of other major industrial powers stepped outside discussions of European economic woes and Afghanistan for a look Friday at options to solidify world resolve against development of an Iranian nuclear bomb and encourage a more forceful response to violence in Syria.
Obama will have the ear of key players on both issues during back-to-back G8 and NATO summits. Discussion will be aimed directly and indirectly at Russia, a sometime protector of both Iran and Syria and the chief blockade to such U.S. goals as an arms embargo on Syria.
The gatherings come in the shadow of the eurozone debt crisis and plummeting public support for the war in Afghanistan. Political and economic chaos in Greece and Spain underscored the fragility of Europe's economy. Germany's finance minister predicted Friday that the crisis could last up to another two years.
Most of the leaders are part of overlapping international coalitions formed to address the Iranian nuclear problem and the newer crisis in Syria, where an estimated 9,000 people have died in more than a year of violence that arose from the pro-democracy Arab uprisings.
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev was to be part of a discussion focused on Syria and Iran on Friday evening among the G8 industrial nations. Faced with implacable Russian opposition to significant new U.N. punishments on the Syrian regime of President Bashar Assad, U.S. officials
A senior U.S. official said one goal of Friday's closed-door discussion at the secluded presidential retreat of Camp David was to impress on Medvedev that other nations that share Russia's usual role at the forefront of international diplomacy are seeking ways to address the Syria debacle without Russian help.
The United States wants to avoid escalating a confrontation with Moscow over Syria, the official said, but wants Medvedev to hear the depth of international outrage. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal diplomacy.
Russia is a partner with the United States and European nations in containing Iran's nuclear program, although with China it has blocked the most severe penalties the U.N. Security Council might impose. A U.N.-affiliated negotiating group including Russia will meet with Iranian officials next week in Baghdad.
White House national security adviser Tom Donilon predicted ready consensus among the leaders that tough economic sanctions must continue, even while a once-dormant diplomatic process shows new life. U.S. officials say the economic pressure of sanctions is key to drawing Iran back to the bargaining table this spring after a long hiatus.
""Each member of the G8 is a core member of this sanctions effort,"" Donilon said Thursday. ""Each member has been absolutely essential to really putting in place what has been an extraordinarily effective and, I think most people would say, surprisingly effective sanctions effort.""
The G8 gathering is expected to produce a statement by the leaders on Iran, which would reinforce the diplomatic effort to prevent Iran's nuclear work from progressing to the point of a bomb. Iran denies it is seeking a bomb. A possible deal could allow Iran to enrich uranium at a lower level than needed to build weapons, with sanctions easing as Iran shows it is scaling back more troublesome work.
Today: Group of Eight leaders will continue their meeting at Camp David. The G8 countries are Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, Britain and the United States.
Sunday and Monday: NATO will hold its summit in Chicago.
Protesters get head start on NATO summit•CHICAGO — Hundreds of protesters broke away from a large rally and began marching through Chicago streets Friday, taunting police and shouting about things as varied as bank bailouts and nuclear power — a prelude to even bigger demonstrations expected after the start of a NATO summit.
Police said there was one arrest for aggravated battery of a police officer. Officers also were seen trying to arrest a man who scaled a bridge tower and pulled down part of a NATO banner. Earlier, police handcuffed a man at the end of a noisy but largely peaceful rally organized by the nation's largest nurses union.
Members of National Nurses United were joined by members of the Occupy movement, unions and veterans at the rally, where they demanded a ""Robin Hood"" tax on banks' financial transactions. The event drew several thousand people.
Jennifer Lacy, a freelance videographer and editor from Chicago who took pictures of the spectacle with her cellphone, gave police high marks for their tolerance.
""I think the police are handling themselves very well,"" she said. ""It seems like they have it all organized, and it doesn't seem their tempers are going to be easily flared. I think they're mindful we're going to be on the world stage."" The Associated Press",en,web
"SUMA KISS OF KINGS SH (DOB 5/29/2007)
We would like to announce that SUMA KISS OF KINGS SH is now at stud to approved hunting dams.
""Trapper"" is an easy-going, gentle, and focused dog. He is very quiet in the house and enjoys the company of ""his people"". He lives to hunt and to please anyone that he is currently with; as he has been handled by Junior Handlers in the Junior Hunter field and passed, guided for complete strangers, and fairs well with being left alone in the house. ""Trapper"" has that eager, alert but reserved ""edge"" about him that makes him fun to train, test or hunt. We feel ""Trapper"" has a sound rear and front assembly, but he is a slow maturer and at 3, is finally developing a chest. This allows us for ample time for him in the field. He is also one of our #1 dog in the field or water as he gives all 110% of him every day of the week for hunts that start at 8AM and end at 3PM!
Now, to brag on him a little bit -- ""Trapper"" passed his JH and SH with ease, and has continued on to the Master field getting 4 out of the 5 required to finish this title (all before his 3rd birthday), we plan to finish his MH in the Fall 2010. He is also training for his NAVHDA Utility that he will test in come Spring 2011. He is also currently training for his Novice Obedience (CD) title that we hope to also have completed before 2010 is over. We have big hopes and dreams for this boy!
His pedigree is LIEBLINGHAUS which is known for producing high-quality show dogs that HUNT, with numerous DCs, HT and AFC/FC titled dogs. Trapper's sire, Chief, is a HOF inductee and was Obedience Sire of the Year. Trapper's dam, Kissy, is from the prominent BLEUGRAS lines which are known to produce excellent show dogs as well, but Kissy goes back to many noteworthy dogs that are German Klemann winners, coming from vom Riverwoods stock. One look at his pedigree and it is clear to see potential!
Trapper is OFA GOOD with NORMAL elbows, and we wish to see the same with any brood bitches that should be brought to him. GOOD or EXCELLENT preferred, and with a SENIOR or MASTER, as well if you only have hunting titles. NAVHDA UTILITY is also fine. We would like to breed him to quality bitches but we will not draw a line at just those titles. Our main concern is to produce healthy and temperamentally sound puppies, hunting ability is an added plus. We ask that you send pictures (front, side [stacked preferred], rear, head), pedigree, and OFA/PENNHip reports when e-mailing.

"Review Summary: Combine Omni with Minus The Bear's previous albums, with predictable results.
2 of 2 thought this review was well written
What exactly is there to say about an album that is both thankfully reassuring and sadly disappointing? Perhaps the best thing to say to sum up exactly what the problem with Infinity Overhead is, is that it is exactly what I expected it to be: Better than Omni and not as good as any of the albums preceding it. It's almost tempting to deride the band and album completely as being all style and no substance; there's Dave Knudson, doing his signature bending and tapping, off-kilter riffs; there's Jake Snider, with the exact same vocal delivery as always, his warm and always just slightly distant sounding croon thickly embedded; there's Cory Murchy doing-actually, where is he? What is promising is that Erin Tate and Alex Rose have both improved: the synths this time around are for the most part much more comfortably unobtrusive, and Erin Tate (who has always been solid and somewhat overlooked) is groovy and energetic. There's songs like ""Diamond Lightning"" and ""Toska"" that recall Planet of Ice, with their atmospheric production and digestible guitar noodling (and don't get me wrong here; Dave Knudson has a fantastic showing on this album, especially on closer ""Cold Company"", where his finger-tapping chromatics reach dizzying heights.)
In short, there's just not much to say about this album because there is simply nothing new on display. While it may be unfair to compare this so much to their previous albums, it is integral to do so to understand the failing of this effort. Where Omni found Minus The Bear losing their way, this album simply sees them finding their way back, but not at all finding a road to forge ahead. It is still a very fun and musically exceptional album, but perhaps the title of track 7 can most successfully describe the inherent flaw; ""Empty Party Rooms."" Where Planet of Ice saw the band maturing and mostly moving past the admittedly goofy demeanor of their first two efforts, Omni and Infinity Overhead are content to be merely fun and enjoyable, which is most disappointing. Fans know that Minus The Bear are capable of so much more, and while not nearly as much as Omni, Infinity Overhead still comes sadly close to sounding like an Empty Party Room.
Combine Omni with Minus The Bear's previous albums, with predictable results.
Your summary kinda bothers me. You basically said, ""Take their latest album, and then all the albums before it, and you can guess what this album sounds like."" That pretty much describes 95% of every single new album to come out ever.",en,unknown

Sacred to the memory of THOMAS NEWTON Esq; and
REBECCA his affectionate wife, who lived many Years the
principal Inhabitants of this Parish, and whose Remains are deposited in a Vault between the Rails of the Communion Table and
the Wall, to which this Monument is affixed. He was a Man well
and deservedly beloved, and as a mark of it, successively elected
Sheriff and Alderman, and in the year 1722, Mayor of this City;
which Offices he discharged with Integrity and peculiar Generosity;
Nor is she less to be remembred in her Station, being endowed with
all social Vertues, and a Pattern of conjugal and parental Affections: She died the eighth Day of February, and he did not
long survive the Loss, exchanging this Life for a better, the
eleventh Day of July 1738.
Not out of Ostentation, nor to flatter the Deceased, is this Marble erected, and this Inscription recorded, but this short commemorative Recitall, to testifye the Duty and Gratitude of the
Living, to their indulgent Parents.
There is a stone in the south isle, under which Sam. Ridgewell
Gent. was interred in 1742, aged 23. and another by the font for John
Lyng, 1740, 67. on which is this,
Although I am mouldering here to Dust,
In Christ is all my Hope and Trust,
My Change was sudden, without Surprise,
By my Example, learn to be wise.
There is a headstone in the churchyard for, John Brooks, who departed this Life all in a watery grave, Sept. 1, 1742, 21. and Isaac
Wolfery with him, they being both drowned in Fuller's hole. (fn. 2)
The Young, the Strong, the Rich, the Wise,
To Death, must all become a Sacrifice.
Persons buried in this church, for whom there are no memorials
remaining, are, Joan Clerk, widow, who was buried by John Clerk,
her husband, in 1466. John Reynolds in 1503, who gave 40s. towards
new leading the church, and two silver candlesticks for the altar.
Tho. Richeman, worsted weaver, he gave 40s. a pair of silver chalices,
and a vestment of 4 marks value, and had this on a brass, formerly to
be seen here,
Orate pro anima Thome Richman, nuper Cibis Norbici, Dursted
Weeber, et Alice Consartis sue, qui quidem Thomas obiit bi. Ja
nuarii, Ao Dni: 1505.
In 1513, John Buxton, worsted weaver, (fn. 3) was buried in the churchyard ""before the image of our Lady in the Oke, and gave to our
Lady in the Oke 6d. This was a famous image of the Virgin Mary,
placed in the oak, which grew in the churchyard, so as it was seen by
all that passed in the street; from whence the church took the name
of St. Martin at the Oak, it being always before, called St. Martin in
Coste-lane, or Coselany, (fn. 4) the whole part of the city from Blackfriars-bridge, or New bridge, to St. Martin at the Oak-gates, being so
called, because it lies on the coste of the river: now it seems this
oak and image began to be of remark about the time of Edward II.
for then I find it first called ate the Oke. What particular virtue,
this good lady had, I do not know, but certain it is, she was much
visited by the populace, who left many gifts in their wills, to dress,
paint, and repair her; at the coming of Edw. VI. to the crown, she
was dismounted, and I am apt to believe the poor oak, also cut down,
least that should be visited for her ladyship's sake, for the present oak,
which now grows in the place, hath not been planted a hundred
years, as appears by the parish register in these words, ""I John
Tabor, constable and overseer, did bring the Oak from Rannerhall near Horning ferry, before me on my horse, and set it in the
churchyard of St. Martin of Coselany, I set it March 9. 1656.""
Then also the rich vestments and plate, were sold, and the money laid
out to fye the river. (fn. 5) 1534, Will. Alleyn, worsted weaver, gave a pall
This rectory was appropriated to the infirmary of Norwich priory,
and paid 3d. synodals, was exempt from the archdeacon of Norwich,
being valued at 12s. and taxed at half a mark. The tithes of Basset's
close, and a third part of the tithes of that part of Gilden-croft, lying
within the bounds of this parish, were due to the rector here and the
mortuary was the best beast; it seems to have been appropriated by
Bishop Blundeville, with the consent of Ric. de Redham, the last
rector, who had a grant of it for life, paying 10s. per annum to the infirmary, which was confirmed by the Bishop and the Pope. And
from that time, it hath been a perpetual curacy or donative, and is
now in the donation of the dean and chapter of Norwich. It was
returned formerly into the Exchequer, to be ""an appropriation of
the dean and chapter, the curate's stipend being 20 marks;"" but now
the curate hath only the income of the estate purchased with the
augmentation money, and the surplice fees and voluntary contributions, amounting in the whole to about 40l. per annum.
In 1460, Sir John Feltwell was parish chaplain. 1492, Sir
Thomas Cawne, alias Plowman, D. D. was buried in the chancel,
and had a stone laid over him with the sacramental cup and wafer
upon it, with the name of Jesus inscribed thereon, and under it this,
Orate pro anima Thome Plawman Capellani ruius anime propicietur
John Prentis, chaplain here, was also buried with this, Orate pro
anima Johannis Prentis Capellani i will Prentis. 1638, Robt.
Kent, S. T. B. (fn. 6) who had been minister here 45 years, died 3 June,
and was succeeded by Henry Spendlove, (a relation of Prebend
Spendlove,) (fn. 7) he was ejected, and after two or three intruders, at the
Restoration, Mr. Pew was appointed curate, and after him Mr.
Studd, who was succeeded by Mr. Peter Burgess, and he by Dr. Will.
Herring, at whose resignation it was given to
The Rev. Mr. Ephraim Megoe, (fn. 8) the present  curate, who
holds it with St. John Sepulchre in Berstreet. (See p. 138.)
There were images with lights, either lamps or wax tapers, burning
before them, of St. Martin, St. Thomas, our Lady of Pity, St. John
Baptist, St. Christopher, St. Anthony, and a chapel, altar, image, and
light of St. Mary at the east end of the south isle.
The religious concerned here were, the Prior of Norwich, who had
a messuage held by Sir John Norwich, Knt. (fn. 9) and after by Sir John
Fastolf, and was called Stone-Hall. The Prioress of Carrow, the
Master of St. Giles's hospital; the Prior of Walsingham had two
messuages and gardens granted to John Peckover, and Will. Wood.
The Prioress of Symplyngham's temporals were taxed at 10s.
In 1637, a dwelling-house under the walls, was granted to Marg.
Gibson, widow, searcher of the infected poor, to hold during the
pleasure of the court, and not otherwise, because it is intended, that
that house shall continue for the only dwelling of such a searcher,
when need shall be. 1343, Sir Barth. de Heylesden gave 6d. a year
out of his messuage here, to the city to maintain Coslany-bridge,
which had many other rents appropriated for that purpose.
Directly opposite to the lane on the north side of St. Martin's
churchyard, called anciently Whores-lane, was the Mill-lane, which
led directly to Calk-mill; which mill, with the fishery thereto belonging, from the Conquest, belonged to the manor of Horseford;
one of the ancient lords of which, granted a yearly rent out of it to
the Prioress of Carrow, before 1287, for that year, the Prioress received 40s. for arrears of rent due from it. In Edward the Third's
time, Sir Robert de Benhale, Knt. held the 3d part of the mills and
manor of Horsford, in right of the lady Eve, daughter of Eve de
Clavering, his then wife. (fn. 10) In 1394, the tithes of this mill were paid
to the keeper of the Infirmary, in right of the appropriated rectory
of St. Martin. In 1518, Lord D'acres, lord of Horsford, owned it,
and was then seized of the fishery belonging to the mill, which was
then set out by them and the corporation, and it extended from the
mill to the bank of the close late of Rob. Thorp; before that of Gregory Clerk, after of Edm. Clerk, and late of Hamond Linsted; and
in 1539, the lord of Horsford granted that fishery to be held of his
manor of Horsford, to Alderman Nic. Sywatt (who then owned the
closes) and his heirs, for ever; and in 1637, the jury for Horsford
manor returned, ""that they had credibly heard Calk-mill to be
seated at or next the house called the Crown, in St. Martin in
(135) St. Mary in Coslany
Was a rectory appropriated to the prior and convent of Cokesford in
Norfolk, who received all the profits, and found a secular canon belonging to their house to serve the cure. He resided generally in the
parsonage-house, which stood against the north-east part of the
churchyard, and after the appropriation became the city house of the
priors and canons of that monastery, to resort to, when either business
or pleasure called them hither; the garden which belonged to it was
very large, (fn. 11) and abutted on Whores-lane north; it was valued at 5
marks and an half, taxed at 20s. first paid 3d. and afterwards 6d. synodals. At the Dissolution, the advowson of the rectory, and all the
great garden and house, were granted to Thomas Duke of Norfolk and
his heirs, from which time it hath been a donative, and it is now in
the donation of the Lord Townesend. It hath no certain endowment,
other than the 200l. of Queen Anne's bounty, which, with the voluntary contributions, surplice fees, &c. do not exceed 20l. a year in

At the east end of this isle, is a chapel of beautiful workmanship,
made with freestone and black flints; this is the chantry chapel of the
Virgin Mary, which was built and endowed with lands and houses,
in Norwich, Barnham-Broom, Hunningham, Sprowston, Heigham, and
Wood-Dallyng, by Robert Thorp, (fn. 17) the founder, in the time of
Hen. VII. He lies buried here, under a stone which hath his own
effigies, and those of his three wives, and three boys and two girls, but
the inscription is lost, though the most part of it is preserved by Mr.
Weever, fo. 803. It had the arms of Thorp, az. three crescents arg.
on the first shield, and the same arms impaled with those of his three
wives, his second wife's arms remain, viz. a fess nebulé between three
wolves head's erased.

The several chantry priests that served here, are buried in this chapel, the first of which was Sir Richard Walloure, or Waller, by his
will dated 1505, (fn. 18) he ordered these lines to be fixed to a marble, and
laid over him, as they now remain:

Ao. 1524, Robert Long, citizen of Norwich, and Agnes his wife,
gave to Gonvile-hall in Cambridge, the perpetual donation to this
chantry, on condition, they constantly nominated an honest priest,
or fellow of their college, to reside constantly in the house belonging
to Thorp's chantry priest in Norwich, (fn. 19) and daily to serve the said
Orate pro anima Johannis Mebber, Arcium Magistri et can-

Sir John Elwyn, who afterwards became rector here, was the last
chantry priest, and had a pension for life of 6l. 13s. 4d. out of the
revenues of his chantry, all which were granted by Edw. VI. Ao 1547,
to Sir Edward Warner, Knt. (fn. 20) and Ric. Catline, Gent. and their heirs,
who in 1549, sold the whole to John Welsh. It was valued to the
tax at 8l. 2s. 6d. per annum.
Weever, fo. 803, hath this which, is now lost.
As I am, so sall yee be,

In 1540, Tho. Atkin, vicar of Mutford, and Margery Hore of the
same town, gave 48l. apiece, to Gonvile-hall, to buy lands of the
value of 4l. per annum, the same Thomas gave also Pain's close in
Worlingham in Suffolk, of 40s. per annum for stipends for three
scholars of the diocese of Norwich, 35s. per annum, who are to be
chosen by the master and two senior fellows.
""Now hear a Word or two (saith Weever) of the Name Hore. I
find saith Verstegan this antiently written Hure, and I find Hure to
be also written for the word Hire; and because that such incontinent
Women do often lett their Bodies to Hire, this Name was therefore aptly applied unto them. It is in the Netherlands written Hoer,
but pronounced Hoor, as wee yet pronounce it, tho' in our later
English Ortography (I know not with what Reason) some write it
Whore. I find many of this Sirname of good Note, and speciall
Regard, in many Places in this Kingdom.""
The nave is covered with lead, and is said to have been rebuilt by
John Stalon, who was sheriff in 1511, and Stephen Stalon, who served

1497, John Bishop, Esq. buried in the church, gave 10l. towards
rebuilding it. In 1373, Will. Plommer, and in 1469, Walter Blake,
mercer, were buried here.
The north isle and chantry chapel of St. John the Baptist, were
built by Will. Ramsey, who lies buried in his chapel under a
large altar tomb robbed of all its brasses, except his merchant's mark,
and the initial letters of his name on each side it, and on the window
are two rams and an A, as a rebus for Ramsa or Ramsey; he was sheriff
in 1498, and mayor in 1502 and 1508, in which year the chapel was
finished; in 1504, Will. Herte, chaplain here, desired to be buried on
the north side of the church, within the precinct of the new ele, there
to be edified, and ordered a gravestone to be laid over him, which is
now disrobed of its brasses. In 1505, Agnes Parker was buried in this
chapel, by John Ebbes, her late husband, and settled a rent charge
out of her tenement to find a lamp before the rood.
In 1513, Sir John Cleyton was chantry priest and curate here. (fn. 22)

Mr. Henry Fawcett (fn. 23) that great benefactor to the city, and this
parish, (see Pt. I. p. 368, 9,) died 1619, and was buried in the north
chapel; his tomb is now broken through to make a passage into the
vestry; his arms on a bend three dolphins with a crescent gul. for
difference, still remain.
There is an inscription on a board standing in the vestry, which
formerly hung by Fawcet's tomb, round which is a vine springing
from the bottom, with leaves and bunches of grapes, between which
are 24 labels, with inscriptions on them:
A deserved Memorial upon the worshipfull and worthy Benefactor to this City and Country, Mr. Henry Fawcet, who departed
this Life, the 21 of Jan. 1619.
Stay Reader here, and e're a Foot thou pass,
See what thou art, and what once Fawcit was,
Whose Body resteth in the Earthly Bed,
But heavenly Soule, to Heaven it's home, is fled:
What in his Life he did, Behold! the Root,
Body, Branches, and afterward the Fruit,
Of him that lived by his Godly care,
Of him that died with a heavenly fear,
For look, how many Branches here you see,
So many Hands imagine, hath this Tree,
Not dealing Pence, unto the poor around,
But Royally imparting, by the Pound,
Oh! England, might in every City be,
So brave a Vine, so beautifull a Tree,
To check the base, and viler Shrubs below,
Who now on Earth, unprofitable grow,
But Fawcit, now thou art in lasting Fame,
Let Rich admire thee, Poor, will bless thy Name,
In Earth thy Body Sleep, thy Soul above,
With Angeis rest, in Charity and Love,
And Norwich mourn thy loss, not like to See,
Hereafter, such another, like to thee.

Queen Elizabeth's mausoleum is painted over the south door, and
this on the east side of it,
Stay Passenger, who e're thou art, retard thy Pace,
View here the Mem'ry, of a Majestick Race,
See here the Emblem of a dying State,
Proves clear, that all alike, must stoop to Fate,
This Urn, no common Ashes doth contain,
The enclosed Majesty, seems Still to Reign,
Only being wearied, with the World's Contest,
Tamely Retires, here to take it's Rest:
And 'tis but Just, that She, who made Religion shine
Should in her Temple, still retain a shrine,
But least this Monument, Should not display,
The greatness of the Jewele, which doth lay
Within it, stay yet further, & thou wilt see,
The true Import of this Effigie.
On the west side,
Here lies Elizabeth, whose Royal breath,
Gave true Religion Life, & false one Death,
Whose Zeal & Power join'd, alike to advance,
God's Honour, Christians Glory, and Church Ordinance.
To say no more; she liv'd, she reign'd, she dy'd,
A Christian Queen, fit to be Canoniz'd.
Queen Elizabeth came in progress to Norwich 16 Aug. 1578,
and died on the eve of the Annunciation of the Virgin Mary 1602.

false, for she lodged during the whole time she was here, at the
Bishop's palace. (See Pt. I. p. 332.)

"I’ll admit – when my daughters rushed into the room shrieking that daddy was taking them to a Star Wars parade – I was skeptical.
1) They were excited about it. Up until that point they thought Star Wars was nothing more than a Lego set in the part of Toys ‘R Us they’d yet to venture into.
2) It was being hosted by our local library.
3) My husband was behind it. You see, back when he was my boyfriend, he somehow convinced me that there was going to be a Disney parade down Broad Street in Philly on my birthday. The details are a bit foggy. Like why I believed him, why I cared, and why I left the apartment with our best friend to see it. Needless to say, the only parade that took place that day was our best friend dragging me back across town to my own apartment after I’d realized that my boyfriend was actually throwing me a surprise party. Me. A surprise party. And the biggest surprise? He got drunk and I got embarrassed. So embarrassed that the next morning I convinced him that he took his gun out during the event and pointed it at all of our friends. Actually, it’s impressive that our relationship survived the Disney parade.
Anyway, back to the Star Wars parade. Since I wasn’t invited to go with them, I kept my suspicions to myself. Because really, what did I care?
And yet I’m still kind of sad I missed it because the events that followed were really funny. Especially after a few drinks at a SpeakeasyDC event. (Yeah, it’s true. We love ourselves some SpeakeasyDC.) But I’ll let him tell it to you. My recaps never really do him justice.

Spurred on by an unnamed chef who is a home-brewing enthusiast, the Obamas have been producing their own beer, while in the process making White House history.
Historians say Obama's term is the first time beer has been brewed the White House.
The President's taste for home brew came to the forefront this week when a war hero asked to have a beer with the president ahead of receiving the nation's highest military award. ...

"Written by PETA
PETA recently uncovered that an elephant traveling with the Ringling Bros. circus, 42-year-old Karen, has tested positive for tuberculosis and was banned from the state of Tennessee earlier this year.
A study conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has documented the ""high prevalence"" of tuberculosis among captive elephants, a serious disease that is highly transmissible from elephants to humans. In 2009 nine people were infected by a TB-positive elephant at a refuge—some who had little or even no direct contact with the infected elephant.
Lota, an elephant who was rented out to circuses, suffered with TB for years before the USDA finally took action that resulted in her being sent to the Elephant Sanctuary, where she spent the last months of her life getting some long-overdue TLC.
Karen is already in poor health. She suffers from painful arthritis and serious foot problems—the leading reasons that captive elephants in the U.S. are euthanized. Late in 2010, Karen and another ailing elephant, Minyak, were both granted a reprieve and permitted to stop traveling, but as of March 2011, Karen is back with Ringling's Blue Unit. She is being forced to perform strenuous and painful tricks, including headstands, that aggravate her condition.
Since Ringling has made it clear it won't give this ailing elephant a break, please ask the U.S. Department of Agriculture—the agency in charge of protecting animals in circuses—to intercede and pull Karen off the road permanently.

"While the meat waits you can start on the sauce. Heat the 1 Tbsp of oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add the garlic and ginger, and cook for about 30 seconds. (If you've never used ginger before, (I hadn't until the first time I tried this recipe), buy a very small piece. Slice off the skin on one side and use a cheese grater, on the very fine side, to grate the ginger. I have a picture below for you, the ginger is in the measuring spoons so you can see what it looks like. Once you've got all the ginger you need you can just leave it on the counter and the side you grated will 'heal' itself and grow the skin back. Awesome, I know).
Pour in the soy sauce, water, and brown sugar, and raise the heat to medium-high and cook for about 4 minutes. The sugar will desolve and the sauce should start to boil. Add the green onions and let it cook for another 30 seconds or so. Remove from heat and set aside. Isn't that color beautiful? Love it!",en,reference
"Phil Puckett ""voted no on sending the EPA a message that they’ve gone too far not once, but twice.""
Republican Party of Virginia on Thursday, June 16th, 2011 in a blog post.
Virginia GOP says Phil Puckett voted against sending EPA a message
The Republican Party of Virginia says state Sen. Phillip P. Puckett, D-Russell, is whistling and cheering as President Barack Obama kills the coal industry.
The RPV’s attack comes on the heels of warnings from American Electric Power, one of the nation’s largest utilities, that new air quality rules from the Environmental Protection Agency could force the company to shutter as many as 20 coal-fired plants and fire hundreds of employees.
That’s added fuel to the fire in coal-rich Southwest Virginia, which is served by Applachian Power, an AEP subsidiary. The state GOP has declared war on the EPA for imposing ""job-killing"" regulations and is calling Puckett ""President Obama’s lead cheerleader in Southwest Virginia.""
""He talks a good game on his campaign website, but when Southwest Virginia needed Puckett to stand up for coal jobs, Puckett stood up for President Obama,"" a recent release from the RPV says. ""Phil voted NO on sending the EPA a message that they’ve gone too far, not once, but twice.""
We wondered whether Puckett really did vote twice to back the EPA.
To support the claim, the state GOP points to two identical pieces of legislation from this year’s General Assembly session -- one introduced in the House, the other in the Senate.
The measures, however, make no mention of the EPA or coal.
The GOP release refers to two resolutions calling for a ""repeal amendment"" that were killed in the Democrat-controlled state Senate. The measures called for a U.S. constitutional amendment that would nullify any federal law or regulation at the vote of two-thirds of all the state legislatures.
What does that have to do with coal jobs? Not a lot, other than the fact that if the repeal amendment survived an extremely difficult path to national ratification, then one of the countless regulations two-thirds of the state legislatures could theoretically agree to repeal might be an EPA rule affecting the coal industry.
To date, North Dakota has the only state legislature that has endorsed the repeal amendment, according to Raegan Weber, director of public affairs for the American Legislative Exchange Council, a conservative organization promoting the constitutional change.
Garren Shipley, a spokesman for the state GOP, said the intent of the repeal amendment was to alert Washington it is encroaching on states’ rights. That’s different from his party’s claim that the amendment's purpose was ""sending the EPA a message that they’ve gone too far"" in regulating the coal industry.
The next problem is that Puckett technically did not vote against the resolution twice -- or even once.
The measure introduced on the Senate side, sponsored by Sen. Ryan T. McDougle, R-Hanover, was killed by a seven-member subcommittee of the Senate Privileges and Elections Committee. Puckett is not a member of the subcommittee and did not participate in its vote.
Puckett is a member, however, of the full 15-member Privileges and Elections Committee. Its chairman -- Sen. Janet Howell, D-Fairfax -- declined a procedural request by GOP senators to resurrect the resolution and allow it to be considered by the full committee. When Republicans objected, Puckett voted with other Democrats to uphold Howell’s authority to set the docket.
The House version of the resolution, sponsored by Del. James M. LeMunyon, R-Fairfax, was left in the same committee without ever coming up for a vote.
Shipley conceded to us that Puckett didn’t cast a single vote directly on the repeal amendment, but insisted the Democrat ""did everything he could to prevent it from being brought to the floor.""
Now, here’s the kicker: Puckett actually sponsored a resolution this year that urged Congress to stop the same type of environmental regulations the state GOP accuses him of supporting.
Puckett’s resolution died in the Senate Rules Committee. It would have urged Congress to adopt legislation ""prohibiting EPA by any means necessary from regulating greenhouse gas emissions, including if necessary defunding EPA greenhouse gas regulatory activities."" The measure also asked for at least a two-year moratorium on new air quality rules.
So let’s look back.
The state GOP says Puckett betrayed his Southwest Virginia constituents by voting twice against sending the EPA a message that new regulations would harm the coal industry.
Here’s the reality: The repeal amendment, which the Republicans use as the basis for the claim, has no direct tie to the EPA or coal. It could just as easily apply to any federal law or regulation in existence, from health care reform to playground safety requirements. Puckett didn’t vote twice against the amendment; he didn’t vote on it at all. Lastly, Puckett actually introduced a resolution seeking to achieve the very goal the GOP accuses him of opposing.
This one’s more than a stretch, it’s absurd. Pants on Fire!

"Red Sox remembrances of 9/11
It is a day none of us will ever forget. Here is what the Red Sox remember.
The Red Sox were in New York getting ready to face Roger Clemens the night of 9/10, but that game was rained out, enabling the team to fly to Tampa a little earlier than planned for their series that was scheduled to begin in St. Petersburg — ironically where the Sox are right now — on 9/11/01.
Knuckleballer Tim Wakefield:
“[My girlfriend and now wife Stacy] was actually in New York with me. She got out because we got rained out. She got the last flight out and beat me [to Tampa] so when we got in at 4 in the morning, she was already sleeping. She was up when all this was taking place and woke me up and said, ‘hey, you need to wake up.’ I started watching it and like 10 minutes later, we saw the second plane hit and we were like, ‘oh god, something bad is happening right now.”’
“To watch stuff on television now, the documentaries about how everything unfolded and how whoever was in charge of grounding all the airplanes made the hardest, right decision anyone could have made. Knowing it would costs the airlines millions and millions of dollars if they stopped all flights immediately, they’d have to ground the planes and all the passengers would have to switch flights. That’s when they found out about United 93. The game was meaningless [compared to what was going on] but we needed to get back playing.”
Wakefield on Ground Zero: “In 2002, I drove by. I took a cab and jus drove by. I didn’t want to get out. in ’05, we went and opened the stock market, me, trot and somebody else, we rang the bell at the American Stock Exchange. We went to somebody’s office that overlooked Ground Zero. He was part of that whole thing. He kept telling us how the building was shaking and all that stuff. The chaos.”
Jason Varitek was out for the remainder of 2001 with a fractured right elbow.
“Actually I didn’t arrive in Tampa. I was on the DL, I was in rehab. I actually arrived that morning to rehab when it all happened. It’s like, once you realize what happened, everybody dropped what they were doing and took off and left.”
“There’s a heightened awareness to everything that goes on around you for one. Appreciation for the people that tried to save lives and to do those things and you reach out to those people who have lost family, friends, etc., in the most tragic thing that’s ever happened here.”
Jacoby Ellsbury, now an All-Star and an MVP candidate, turned 18 years old on Sept. 11, 2001. He was a junior at Madras (Oregon) High School.
“I just remember going to school and waking up that morning and hearing something happened. At school, we turned on all the TV’s and saw everything unfold. At the beginning, I don’t think anyone really knew what was going on. But yeah, I just remember watching things unfold from Madras (ore.) High. I was on my way to school when I kind of heard everything. It’s hard to believe it’s been 10 years.”
The 2001 season was basically the only year of Terry Francona’s youth or adult life that he wasn’t wearing a baseball uniform. Francona was a scout for the Indians in 2001, and was on assignment in Pittsburgh when the terrorist attacks happened. His best friend Brad Mills was also scouting for the Cubs at that time, and was in Pittsburgh, at the same hotel as Francona when everything happened.
“I was in Pittsburgh scouting and coincidentally Millsy was scouting for the Cubs. He was advancing. He was upstairs in the concierge room because he never pays for coffee. So he called me and he was like, ‘hey, you need to come up here, man. I went upstairs and I sat there with him. Kind of watched it and then rented a car and drove back to Philly because obviously there weren’t going to be games. I remember driving by Shanksville (Pennsylvania) on the turnpike. The exit was closed. I remember being glad I was with Millsy. Times like that, it’s nice to have maybe your best friend in the whole world with you.”
Francona is glad that soldiers can take some enjoyment out of being around baseball: “I hope it does. If you like baseball, I don’t know that it matters what you do. obviously I hope what we do, people get enjoyment out of it. I think it’s cool that they bring soldiers and people like that around and they honor them at the ballparks. I think everybody enjoys that. I think it’s a really neat thing. If they get some enjoyment out of what we’re doing, that’s terrific.”
Of course, perhaps nobody affiliated with the Red Sox had a more compelling 9/11 story than Trot Nixon, whose wife Kathryn gave birth to the couple’s first son on 9/11/01. Today, Chase Nixon turned 10 years old. Here is an in-depth story I did with Trot and Kathryn back in 2002.",en,books

"Shooting at Wal-Mart
In 1995, Gov. Smirk signed legislation to allow concealed handguns
in churches, stadiums, Luby's cafeterias and so on.
Since we've had another shooting, [This was written May 25, 2000] I'd like to propose a scenario.
Let's say there are 160 people in a Wal-Mart Super-Center in Dallas.
Out of the 160, let's say half are carrying a concealed gun.
All of a sudden, Adam, in aisle 2, thinks he's heard a gunshot inside the store.
He draws his weapon, certain that he's going to stop a crime in progress.
Bill, in aisle 4, heard the same sound, so he draws his weapon.
Charlie and David, in aisle 7, heard the sound, and draw their guns.
Adam looks around the corner of the aisle and sees Charlie and David
with their guns out. Adam figures Charlie and David are working together
to either rob the Wal-Mart or just shoot the place up. With all the best
intentions a ditto-monkey can muster, trying to fulfill the mandate put upon
him by the governor of Texas, trying to help, Adam fires on Charlie and David.
Meanwhile, Bill sees Adam fire at Charlie and David, and assumes he's the nut.
With all the best intentions, Bill fires at Adam.
Meanwhile, Charlie and David are innocent, law-abiding citizens being shot at
inside a Wal-Mart and, since they're armed, they return fire.
Ed is in aisle 10, with his buddy Frank, and both are carrying.
Ed and Frank see Charlie and David shooting, but they don't see Adam,
so they figure Charlie and David are the culprits, so they open fire.
All this time, Greg and Henry, two Wal-Mart employees, see a gunfight
in their store, so they grab rifles off the wall and return fire.
There are six untrained scared ditto-monkeys shooting anything that moves
and there's 154 people in the store running and screaming in a panic.
Thirty minutes later, there are 16 dead and 35 wounded.
...and the funny part?
Sherry was making balloon animals in the children's shoe department.
One of the balloons popped.
That's how this whole bloody mess got started.
A really, really stupid idea combined with Smirk's signature means
a popped balloon translates into 16 dead and 35 wounded.
Isn't is odd that an organization with less than 4,000,000 members
can force their firearms policy on the other 276,00,000 Americans?

"Oct. 24, 2012 - Issue #888: Winter Guide 2012
Two companies put different spins on the big O
The first is long-established around the province, but Alberta Opera, now 29 seasons old, makes use of the O-word in name only: it's been quite a while since the company tackled traditional opera as it did in its early days, having long ago moved on to musical theatre adaptations of classic stories, and touring those through schools and theatres alike (the company's full title now includes the subhead ""Musical Theatre For Young People""). Currently helmed by the artistic partnership of Farren Timoteo and composer Jeff Unger, it's been that way as long as Timoteo's been involved—he cautions that he isn't quite sure when the switch came, but thinks it was fairly early on in the company's history.
""I don't want to speak out of turn,"" he notes, ""[but] when Garner [Butler] and Jeff formed their artistic union, and started composing and creating together, I think the rewards were pretty instant: it was fun, it was creative, it was pushing them as artists, and it felt like the right direction for Alberta Opera to go.""
The company's certainly seen that shift in direction greeted warmly over the years: it played to some 75 000 students in 2011, and has plenty of Sterling nominations and wins attached to its name. Now that much-lauded artistic push is being applied to Sleeping Beauty: Timoteo and Unger have assembled a squadron of MacEwan grads to blast through 117 years of the fairy tale sleeping princess. It was the idea of toying with time, Timoteo notes, that shaped their take on the tale. Not just in what happens during the protagonist's main snooze, but also in a number of leaps in time the fairy tale offers.
""As we started looking into those, we discovered there was a whole kingdom at work here,"" Timoteo says. ""That it wasn't just this royal family that was being affected by these changes, it might be interesting to explore how a person can make a decision, and what kind of effect that has on a whole populace of people, and how that might change over the course of years.
""Typically, in the original fairy tale, after the princess has been cursed by the evil fairy, the king or the queen bans spinning wheels,"" he continues. ""We took that to the next level: we have the queen banning spinning wheels—spinning wheels, round everything. So we then go 16 years into the future and see how extremely that's been interpreted, and how those kinds of things change: costumes are square. We put it into the choreography, the music's in a square time signature. Things like that.""
The other off-the-path take on opera, much newer to town, sticks to more traditional subject matter but veers off the beaten path to find new pefromance places. Mercury Opera, whose tagline is ""Opera Where You Least Expect It,"" offers just that: last year, the company took over an LRT station. Now, it's the grounds of the downtown Farmer's Market.
Fiamma (Italian for ""fire"") will station itself (and audiences) in an ""alleyway of light,"" and string together a selection of fiery female operatic numbers by an assembeld cast of Alberta vocal talent.
Darcia Parada, who created Mercury Opera and its unusual stagings in New York before transplanting to Edmonton, notes both the rarity and potency of seeing such powerful singers up close.
""Any performance can gain [from this],"" she explains. ""But maybe with Opera ... because singers are vibrating on such a high level when they're singing in that style, they're not trying to sing into a microphone, they're making big sound. The sound is around them. I don't know if you've ever gotten up close to someone who was singing opera with a big, operatic voice. I mean, in our case, it's going to be amplified, because we don't have a choice. But there is a visceral thing that happens.
""When you're in a 2500-seat house—and imagine how deep the stage is—you really don't get a sense of that at all,"" Parada continues. ""So the closer you are, the more immediate it is, in every possible way.""

Running time: 90 minutes

An attractive woman, played by Kate Winslet, gets ready for a blind date with a man who is rich, caring and handsome but has remained mysteriously single. He turns out to be a charming bon vivant, played by Hugh Jackman, whose sole flaw — revealed when he removes his scarf — is that he has a pair of testicles hanging from his neck.
No one else seems to notice this, despite Winslet’s frantic mugging. Jackman will drip soup onto the scrotum, and later accidentally dip it into a dish of melted butter that came with the lobster dinner. At one stage, a pubic hair falls into his food.
And (speaking of dickheads) so unfolds the first of 12 punishing short films — short, but never short enough — in the astonishing spectacle called Movie 43. Featuring many famous actors and directors, it’s an eye-opening example of what happens when a bad idea goes worse.
The concept, credited to producers Charles B. Wessler and Peter Farrelly, was apparently, “Let’s be as crude and stupid as possible and see what happens.” The answer is that a pubic hair falls into your food.
There’s no point to the first short (which is directed by Farrelly), or indeed for any of them. The idea of a neck scrotum is its own comic reward, just as it must remain in subsequent episodes where, for example, Anna Faris plays a young woman who asks her devoted boyfriend, Chris Pratt, that age-old question, “Will you poop on me?” The rest of the time is taken up with scenes of the Pratt character eating Mexican food and suffering from wall-shaking flatulence awaiting the big moment.
Movie 43 — the unexplained title is the least of its enigmas — was loosely motivated by an irreverent 1977 film called The Kentucky Fried Movie, but with more references to vaginas, one of the film’s chief obsessions. “It’s obscene. It’s offensive,” says a movie executive (Greg Kinnear) in the framing story, in which desperate screenwriter Dennis Quaid is supposed to be pitching this very film, a conceit that is at once cheap, ridiculous, tiresome and, yes, obscene and offensive.
The worse crime, though, is that it’s not funny. I like to think I enjoy a good poop-on-me joke as much as the next man, but the creators have to do something with it. Not that one can expect such a premise to illuminate the human condition, but all Movie 43 does is cover it in feces and call it hilarity.
And so on it goes: Emma Stone and Kieran Culkin as ex-lovers screaming insults at one another (“Do you still like fingers in your butt-hole?”); Halle Berry responding to a truth-or-dare challenge by stirring guacamole with her breast (relax: it’s a prosthetic); Richard Gere struggling to understand the problem with the “iBabe,” an MP-3 player shaped like a naked woman, but with a dangerous fan spinning in its vagina.
There is one promising episode here, with Justin Long as Robin, the superhero sidekick, at a speed dating club and Jason Sudeikis as an interfering Batman. But it’s too little, too lame. Movie 43 is the year’s first utter disaster.",en,books

This invention relates to the art of single use throw-away type water purifiers and specifically deals with pancake-like packets or pads of water treating chemicals.
Heretofore known water purifiers required expensive, heavy, and bulky containers and were usually permanently installed in household pipelines. Smaller cartridges of water filtering material, such as activated carbon, have been proposed for attachment to water faucets and the like, but these units also require a permanent housing and plumbing attachments and, like their larger counterpart, must be opened up and recharged with fresh chemicals.
Since there are many instances where water purification and softening of a truly portable nature is desired, it would be an improvement in this art to provide inexpensive single use throw-away water purifiers in a compact easily handled package conveniently inserted in the inlet mouth of conventional household appliances and utensils to soften and purify the water just prior to its use. This invention, therefore, provides water purifiers in the form of compact small light weight and easily handled packets which are sufficiently inexpensive to be disposed of after single usage.
According to this invention, dosages of water treating chemicals are packaged in disposable plastic material housings containing porous filter membranes and baffles to direct water flow from a top inlet in an extended serpentine pass through the membranes and dosages of chemicals as it flows to the bottom outlet of the housing. The dosages can vary in amounts and chemical composition depending on the quality and quantity of the water to be treated. For example, if only about 1 gallon of water with impurities in the range of 0.05 to 0.07% is to be purified, several ounces of chemicals should be sufficient.
The preferred housing may be an inexpensive thin walled stiff shape retaining polyvinyl chloride doughnut-like member about 3/4 to 11/2 inches high, about 21/2 to 41/2 inches in diameter, with a central inlet in the top thereof and a central outlet in the bottom thereof, about 1/2 inch in diameter. The plastics materials, sizes and shapes of the housing can be varied to suit conditions, but the walls of the housing need only be very thin in the order of 0.010 to 0.030 inches for minimizing costs. The housing is easily formed from two molded cup members united in opposed relation around the peripheries of their mouths.
The membranes are preferably a porous plastics material, vacuum molded in hollow tire-shape. Two of these membranes are stacked together in the housing on opposite sides of a thin dividing wall or wafer with a 1/2 inch hole in its center and with its periphery heat sealed between the rims of the opposed cups forming the housing. The porous plastic members have very thin film-like or membrane-like walls, but stiff enough to hold their shape. Thicknesses in the range of 0.005 to 0.030 inches are useful. The membranes are preferably constructed of a polyolefine molded to a porous state with pores preferably not exceeding about 500 micrometers. The dividing wall wafer has an outside diameter mating with the rims of the plastic housing cups and preferably has a thickness in the order of 0.02 to 0.03 inches.
The top of the top membrane and the bottom of the bottom membrane are covered with thin circular wafers or baffles of impervious plastics material of the same order of thickness as the dividing wall between the membranes, but no holes are provided in these top and bottom wafers.
All of the plastics materials should, of course, be FDA approved for drinking water use.
The membrane compartments are filled with water treating chemicals, preferably in the form of small beads, flakes or granules of ion exchange resins, activated charcoal and the like. The pair of superimposed membrane compartments may be filled with the same or different chemicals in dosages to insure water purification on a single pass through the housing. The peripheries of the membranes are spaced inwardly from the periphery of the housing and the wafers or baffles are spaced from the top and bottom walls of the housing to direct the water flow from the top inlet radially outward to the periphery of the top membrane, thence radially inward through the chemicals to the central hole in the dividing wall or baffle, thence radially outwardly through the chemical in the bottom membrane, through the periphery of this bottom membrane and thence radially inward to the bottom outlet of the housing. The extended flow path insures fast flow and maximum intimate contact of the water with the chemicals. A gravity flow of only 2 minutes or less for one gallon of water to pass through entire purifier is achieved.
The pad-like purifiers of this invention may vary greatly in size and shape with the plastics material components being quite thin to minimize cost and still provide structural strength to maintain the shape and seal the chemicals in the porous membrane compartments.
It is then an object of this invention to provide a disposable water purifier in the form of a flat pancake-like packet or pad containing one or more dosages of water treating chemicals and adapted for use with conventional water receiving household devices as water is flowed into such devices.
Another object of this invention is to provide a throwaway type water purifier pad for use with conventional household appliances and utensils.
A specific object of this invention is to provide a flat pad or pancake packet containing one or more dosages of water treating chemicals and having a top inlet and a bottom outlet with a porous filter membrane separating the dosage from the inlet and outlet and baffle means in the housing extending the water flow path between the water inlet and outlet.
A further specific object of this invention is to provide a disposable single use water purifier having a doughnut-like housing containing stacked porous membrane compartments filled with water treating chemicals and a serpentine flow path for water through the housing and chemicals.
A very specific object of the invention is to provide a disposable water purifier of thin-walled molded plastics material providing a flat pancake-like pad containing a plurality of superimposed membranes filled with solid particles of water treating chemicals and having exposed peripheral porous walls receiving water flow therethrough together with baffle means directing the water flow in a serpentine path from a top inlet to a bottom outlet of the housing.
Other and further objects of this invention will be apparent to those skilled in this art from the following detailed description of the annexed sheets of drawings, which show a best mode embodiment of the invention.
FIGS. 1-4 are somewhat diagrammatic perspective views of water receiving household appliances each provided with a disposable water purifier of this invention at the inlet thereof.
FIG. 5 is a perspective view of a purifier packet or pad of this invention.
FIG. 6 is a vertical cross sectional view of the purifier along the line VI--VI of FIG. 5.
FIG. 7 is an exploded view of the components of the purifier of FIGS. 5 and 6.
FIG. 8 is a plan view of one of the annular membrane components with parts broken away to show underlying portions.
FIG. 9 is a plan view of the separator wall or wafer between the stacked membranes.
FIG. 10 is a plan view of one of the wafers or baffles at the top and bottom of the stacked membranes.
FIG. 11 is a side elevational view showing the manner in which a plurality of the purifiers of FIGS. 1-10 may be stacked and sealed together.
In FIGS. 1-4, purifier packets or pads 10 of this invention are illustrated in use with various types of household utentils or appliances to show the compatibility of the purifiers of this invention with standard household devices.
In FIG. 1, the purifier 10 is illustrated as mounted in a funnel 11 for feeding water to a coffeepot 12. The water must pass through the purifier 10.
In FIG. 2 the purifier 10 is mounted in the water inlet 13 of a coffee maker 14.
In FIG. 3 the purifier 10 is mounted in the water inlet 15 of a portable molded plastic water bottle 16 having a dispensing outlet 17. The device 16 is of the type conveniently mounted in an icebox to provide chilled water.
In FIG. 4 the purifier 10 is mounted in the water inlet 18 of an ice cube maker 19 of the type mounted in the freezing compartment of a refrigerator 20.
The conventional household appliances or utentils of FIGS. 1-4 thus have the water fed thereto treated by a purifier 10 of this invention. This purifier 10 is sized for easily handling and may take various shapes to fit the water inlets of the devices. It is completely disposable and thrown away after use. No special holders or auxiliary containers are needed.
As shown in FIG. 5, the purifier 10 is a flat cylindrical pad or pancake-like packet with a top central inlet 21 and a bottom central outlet 22.
As shown in FIGS. 6 and 7, the purifier 10 has a housing 23 composed of two thin walled cup-shaped molded plastic halves 24 and 25 each with a flat cylindrical base 26 and an upstanding peripheral cylindrical sidewall 27. The top cup member 24 contains the central circular inlet 21 in its base 26 while the bottom cup member 25 contains the central circular outlet 22. The cylindrical sidewalls 27 of the cup members have aligned rims 28. A thin impervious plastics material circular wall or disk 29 spans the mouths of the inverted cup members 24 and 25 and has its periphery extended between their rims 28. The periphery of the disk 29 is heat sealed to the rims forming a housing with a top compartment 30 and a bottom compartment 31. The wall or disk 29 has a central opening or hole 32 therethrough.
A top cylindrical bead or shoulder 33 and an aligned bottom cylindrical shoulder or bead 34 are integrally formed around the wall or disk 29 between the inlet and periphery of the wall, but closer to the periphery.
A pair of hollow tire-shaped annular porous membranes 35 are seated on opposite faces of the wall 29. These membranes 35 are channel-shaped in cross section with an upstanding outer peripheral wall 36 and radial legs 37. The bottom leg of the top membrane 35 is abutted against the top bead 33 of the wall 29 while the top leg 37 of the bottom membrane 36 is bottomed against the bottom wall 34 of the wall. These legs are secured to the wall 29 as by heat sealing or by an adhesive.
The peripheral wall 36 of each membrane is of smaller diameter than the sidewalls 27 of the cups 24 and 25 forming the housing 23 thereby providing an annular space between the housing and the membrane on each side of the dividing wall 29.
The top leg 37 of the top membrane 35 and the bottom leg 37 of the bottom membrane 35 are covered with thin plastic circular baffles or wafers 38 with each baffle having a bead or shoulder 39 abutting the inner end of the leg. The baffles 38 are sealed to the adjacent leg by heat sealing or glue.
The baffles 38 are spaced inwardly from the top and bottom walls 26 of the housing 23 providing flow paths or gaps 40 commmunicating with the gaps or flow paths 41 surrounding the peripheries of the membranes.
Each membrane 35 is filled with a solid water treating chemical in the form of small granules or beads. Thus, the top membrane maybe filled with an ion exchange resin 42 while the bottom membrane may be filled with a bacteria filtering chemical such as activated charcoal 43.
Water entering the inlet 21 flows through the top gap or passage 40 radially outward to the top peripheral passage 41 and thence through the porous wall 36 of the top membrane 35 to flow radially inward through the dosage of chemicals 42 to exit through the hole 32 in the dividing wall 29 and flow radially outward through the chemicals 43 in the bottom membrane 35, then exiting through the peripheral wall 36 of this bottom membrane 35, into the bottom gap or passage 41 between the bottom membrane and the sidewall 26 of the bottom cup member 25 and thence radially inward through the passage 40 between the bottom baffle 38 and the bottom wall 26 of the bottom cup 25 to exit at the outlet 22. An extended serpentine reversed flow path is thus provided for the water forcing it to flow radially inward through the chemicals in the top membrane and radially outward through the chemicals in the bottom membrane. This arrangement provides increased intimate contact between the chemicals and the water.
While two superimposed membranes are provided in the housing 23, as illustrated, it should be understood that three or more superimposed membranes could also be provided.
Further, as shown in FIG. 11, a plurality of packets or pads 10 can be stacked in sealed relation connecting the bottom outlet 22 of the top pad with the top inlet 21 of a bottom pad without leakage by the use of an annulus of double-faced adhesive tape 44 between the superimposed pads adhesively sealed to the adjacent walls 26 thereof and surrounding the outlet 22 of the top pad 10 and the inlet 21 of the bottom pad 10.
It will be understood that the components of the purifier pads of this invention are inexpensive plastics material easily molded and having thin walls for economy sake. The porous membranes preferably have pores in the order of 500 micrometer. While the purifiers have been shown in the form of flat pancake-like circular members it should be understood that the shapes of the pads can be varied to suit conditions of use.
From the above descriptions it will be understood that this invention provides an inexpensive, compact, lightweight, water purifier containing selected dosages of water purifying and filtering chemicals and formed from sufficiently inexpensive materials as to warrant disposal after single usage. The devices are sized and shaped to fit water inlets of conventional household appliances and utensils.

"According to Buddhist tradition, the disciple Devadatta was the Buddha's cousin and also brother to the Buddha's wife, Yasodhara. Devadatta is said to have caused a split in the sangha by persuading 500 monks to leave the Buddha and follow him instead.
This story of Devadatta is preserved in the Pali Tipitika. In this story, Devadatta entered the order of Buddhist monks at the same time as Ananda and other noble youths of the Shakya clan, the clan of the historical Buddha.
Devadatta applied himself to practice. But he became frustrated when he failed to progress toward becoming an arhat. So, instead, he applied his practice toward developing supernatural power instead of the realization of enlightenment.
It was said he also became driven by jealousy of his kinsman, the Buddha. Devadatta believed he should be the World-Honored One and the leader of the order of monks.
One day he approached the Buddha and pointed out that the Buddha was growing older. He proposed that he be put in charge of the order to relieve the Buddha of the burden. The Buddha rebuked Devadatta harshly and said he was not worthy. Thus Devadatta became the Buddha's enemy.
Later, the Buddha was questioned how his harsh response to Devadatta was justified as Right Speech. I'll come back to this a bit later.
Devadatta had gained the favor of Prince Ajatasattu of Magadha. Ajatasattu's father, King Bimbisara, was a devoted patron of the Buddha. Devadatta persuaded the prince to murder his father and assume the throne of Magadha.
At the same time, Devadatta vowed to have the Buddha murdered so he could take over the sangha. So that the deed could not be traced back to Devadatta, the plan was to send a second group of ""hit men"" to assassinate the first one, and then a third group to take out the second one, and so on for some time. But when the would-be assassins approached the Buddha they couldn't carry out the order.
Then Devadatta tried to do the job himself, by dropping a rock on the Buddha. The rock bounced off the mountain side and broke into pieces. The next attempt involved a large bull elephant in a drug-induced fury, but the elephant was gentled in the Buddha's presence.
Finally Devadatta attempted to split the sangha by claiming superior moral rectitude. He proposed a list of austerities and asked that they become mandatory for all monks and nuns. These were:
- Monks must live all their lives in the forest.
- Monks must live only on alms obtained by begging, and should not accept invitations to dine with others.
- Monks must wear robes made only from rags collected from rubbish heaps and cremation grounds. They must not accept donations of cloth at any time. (See Kathina.)
- Monks must sleep at the foot of trees and not under a roof.
- Monks must refrain from eating fish or meat throughout their lives.
The Buddha responded as Devadatta had predicted he would. He said that monks could follow the first four austerities if they wished, but he refused to make them mandatory. And he rejected the fifth austerity entirely. (See Buddhism and Vegetarianism.)
Devadatta persuaded 500 monks that his Super Austerity Plan was a surer path to enlightenment than the Buddha's, and they followed Devadatta to become his disciples. In response, the Buddha sent two of his disciples, Sariputra and Mahamaudgayalyana, to teach the dharma to the wayward monks. Upon hearing the dharma explained correctly, the 500 monks returned to the Buddha.
Devadatta was now a sorry and broken man, and he soon fell mortally ill. On his deathbed he repented of his misdeeds and wished to see the Buddha one more time, but Devadatta died before his liter-bearers could reach him.
Life of Devadatta, Alternate Version
The lives of the Buddha and his disciples were preserved in several oral recitation traditions before they were written down. The Pali tradition, which is the foundation of Theravada Buddhism, is the best known. Another oral tradition was preserved by the Mahasanghika sect, which was formed about 320 BCE. Mahasanghika is an important forerunner of Mahayana.
Mahasanghika remembered Devadatta as a devout and saintly monk. No trace of the ""evil Devadatta"" story can be found in their version of the canon. This has led some scholars to speculate that the story of the renegade Devadatta is a later invention.
The Abhaya Sutta, on Right Speech
If we assume the Pali version of Devadatta's story is the more accurate one, however, we can find an interesting footnote in the Abhava Sutta of the Pali Tipitika (Majjhima Nikaya 58). In brief, the Buddha was questioned about the harsh words he said to Devadatta that caused him to turn against the Buddha.
The Buddha justified his criticisms of Devadatta by comparing him to a small child who had taken a pebble into his mouth and was about to swallow it. Adults would naturally do whatever it took to get the pebble out of the child. Even if extracting the pebble drew blood, it must be done. The moral appears to be that it is better to hurt someone's feelings than to let them dwell in deceitfulness.",en,reference

"Public Papers - 1991
White House Fact Sheet on The Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START)
Today, the United States and the Soviet Union signed the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty. This treaty marks the first agreement between the two countries in which the number of deployed strategic nuclear weapons will actually be reduced. Reductions will take place over a period of 7 years, and will result in parity between the strategic nuclear forces of the two sides at levels approximately 30 percent below currently deployed forces. Deeper cuts are required in the most dangerous and destabilizing systems.
START provisions are designed to strengthen strategic stability at lower levels and to encourage the restructuring of strategic forces in ways that make them more stable and less threatening. The treaty includes a wide variety of very demanding verification measures designed to ensure compliance and build confidence.
The treaty sets equal ceilings on the number of strategic nuclear forces that can be deployed by either side. In addition, the treaty establishes an equal ceiling on ballistic missile throw-weight (a measure of overall capability for ballistic missiles). Each side is limited to no more than:
-- 1600 strategic nuclear delivery vehicles (deployed intercontinental ballistic missiles [ICBM's], submarine launched ballistic missiles [SLBM's], and heavy bombers), a limit that is 36 percent below the Soviet level declared in September 1990 and 29 percent below the U.S. level.
-- 6000 total accountable warheads, about 41 percent below the current Soviet level and 43 percent below the current U.S. level.
-- 4900 accountable warheads deployed on ICBM's or SLBM's, about 48 percent below the current Soviet level and 40 percent below the current U.S. level.
-- 1540 accountable warheads deployed on 154 heavy ICBM's, a 50-percent reduction in current Soviet forces. The U.S. has no heavy ICBM's.
-- 1100 accountable warheads deployed on mobile ICBM's.
-- Aggregate throw-weight of deployed ICBM's and SLBM's equal to about 54 percent of the current Soviet aggregate throw-weight.
Ballistic Missile Warhead Accountability
The treaty uses detailed counting rules to ensure the accurate accounting of the number of warheads attributed to each type of ballistic missile.
-- Each deployed ballistic missile warhead counts as 1 under the 4900 ceiling and 1 under the 6000 overall warhead ceiling.
-- Each side is allowed 10 on-site inspections each year to verify that deployed ballistic missiles contain no more warheads than the number that is attributed to them under the treaty.
Downloading Ballistic Missile Warheads
The treaty also allows for a reduction in the number of warheads on certain ballistic missiles, which will help the sides transition their existing forces to the new regime. Such downloading is permitted in a carefully structured and limited fashion.
-- The U.S. may download its three-warhead Minuteman III ICBM by either one or two warheads. The Soviet Union has already downloaded it's seven warhead SS - N - 18 SLBM by four warheads.
-- In addition, each side may download up to 500 warheads on two other existing types of ballistic missiles, as long as the total number of warheads removed from downloaded missiles does not exceed 1250 at any one time.
The treaty places constraints on the characteristics of new types of ballistic missiles to ensure the accuracy of counting rules and prevent undercounting of missile warheads.
-- The number of warheads attributed to a new type of ballistic missile must be no less than the number determined by dividing 40 percent of the missile's total throw-weight by the weight of the lightest RV tested on that missile.
-- The throw-weight attributed to a new type must be no less than the missile's throw-weight capability at specified reference ranges (11,000 km for ICBM's and 9,500 km for SLBM's).
START places significant restrictions on the Soviet SS - 18 heavy ICBM.
-- A 50-percent reduction in the number of Soviet SS - 18 ICBM's; a total reduction of 154 of these Soviet missiles.
-- New types of heavy ICBM's are banned.
-- Downloading of heavy ICBM's is banned.
-- Heavy SLBM's and heavy mobile ICBM's are banned.
-- Heavy ICBM's will be reduced on a more stringent schedule than other strategic arms.
Because mobile missiles are more difficult to verify than other types of ballistic missiles, START incorporates a number of special restrictions and notifications with regard to these missiles. These measures will significantly improve our confidence that START will be effectively verifiable.
-- Nondeployed mobile missiles and non-deployed mobile launchers are numerically and geographically limited so as to limit the possibility for reload and refire.
-- The verification regime includes continuous monitoring of mobile ICBM production, restrictions on movements, on-site inspections, and cooperative measures to improve the effectiveness of national technical means of intelligence collection.
Because heavy bombers are stabilizing strategic systems (e.g., they are less capable of a short-warning attack than ballistic missiles), START counting rules for weapons on bombers are different than those for ballistic missile warheads.
-- Each heavy bomber counts as one strategic nuclear delivery vehicle.
-- Each heavy bomber equipped to carry only short-range missiles or gravity bombs is counted as one warhead under the 6000 limit.
-- Each U.S. heavy bomber equipped to carry long-range nuclear ALCM's (up to a maximum of 150 bombers) is counted as 10 warheads even though it may be equipped to carry up to 20 ALCM's.
-- A similar discount applies to Soviet heavy bombers equipped to carry long-range nuclear ALCM's. Each such Soviet heavy bomber (up to a maximum of 180) is counted as 8 warheads even though it may be equipped to carry up to 16 ALCM's.
-- Any heavy bomber equipped for long-range nuclear ALCM's deployed in excess of 150 for the U.S. or 180 for the Soviet Union will be accountable by the number of ALCM's the heavy bomber is actually equipped to carry.
Building on recent arms control agreements, START includes extensive and unprecedented verification provisions. This comprehensive verification regime greatly reduces the likelihood that violations would go undetected.
-- START bans the encryption and encapsulation of telemetric information and other forms of information denial on flight tests of ballistic missiles. However, strictly limited exemptions to this ban are granted sufficient to protect the flight-testing of sensitive research projects.
-- START allows 12 different types of on-site inspections and requires roughly 60 different types of notifications covering production, testing, movement, deployment, and destruction of strategic offensive arms.
START will have a duration of 15 years, unless it is superseded by a subsequent agreement. If the sides agree, the treaty may be extended for successive 5-year periods beyond the 15 years.
Noncircumvention and Third Countries
START prohibits the transfer of strategic offensive arms to third countries, except that the treaty will not interfere with existing patterns of cooperation. In addition, the treaty prohibits the permanent basing of strategic offensive arms outside the national territory of each side.
Air-Launched Cruise Missiles (ALCM's)
START does not directly count or limit ALCM's. ALCM's are limited indirectly through their association with heavy bombers.
-- Only nuclear-armed ALCM's with a range in excess of 600 km are covered by START.
-- Long-range, conventionally armed ALCM's that are distinguishable from nuclear-armed ALCM's are not affected.
-- Long-range nuclear-armed ALCM's may not be located at air bases for heavy bombers not accountable as being equipped for such ALCM's.
-- Multiple warhead long-range nuclear ALCM's are banned.
Sea Launched Cruise Missiles (SLCM's)
SLCMs are not constrained by the treaty. However, each side has made a politically binding declaration as to its plans for the deployment of nuclear-armed SLCM's. Conventionally-armed SLCM's are not subject to such a declaration.
-- Each side will make an annual declaration of the maximum number of nuclear-armed SLCM's with a range greater than 600 km that it plans to deploy for each of the following 5 years.
-- This number will not be greater than 880 long-range nuclear-armed SLCM's.
-- In addition, as a confidence building measure, nuclear-armed SLCM's with a range of 300 - 600 km will be the subject of a confidential annual data exchange.
The Soviet Backfire bomber is not constrained by the treaty. However, the Soviet side has made a politically binding declaration that it will not deploy more than 800 air force and 200 naval Backfire bombers, and that these bombers will not be given intercontinental capability.
The START agreement consists of the treaty document itself and a number of associated documents. Together they total more than 700 pages. The treaty was signed in a public ceremony by Presidents Bush and Gorbachev in St. Vladimir's Hall in the Kremlin. The associated documents were signed in a private ceremony at Novo Ogaryevo, President Gorbachev's weekend dacha. Seven of these documents were signed by Presidents Bush and Gorbachev. Three associated agreements were signed by Secretary Baker and Foreign Minister Bessmertnykh. In addition, the START negotiators, Ambassadors Brooks and Nazarkin, exchanged seven letters related to START in a separate event at the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Moscow.
Magnitude of START -- Accountable Reductions
Following is the aggregate data from the Memorandum of Understanding, based upon agreed counting rules in START. (Because of those counting rules, the number of heavy bomber weapons actually deployed may be higher than the number shown in the aggregate.) This data is effective as of September 1990
(TABLE START)and will be updated at entry into force:
Delivery Vehicles .... 2,246 .... 2,500
Warheads .... 10,563 .... 10,271
Ballistic Missile Warheads .... 8,210 .... 9,416
Heavy ICBM's/Warheads .... None .... 308/3080
Throw-weight (metric tons) .... 2,361.3 .... 6,626.3
As a result of the treaty, the above values will be reduced by the following percentages:
Delivery Vehicles .... 29 percent .... 36 percent
Warheads .... 43 percent .... 41 percent
Ballistic Missile Warheads .... 40 percent .... 48 percent
Heavy ICBM's/Warheads .... None .... 50 percent
Throw-weight (metric tons) .... None .... 46 percent",en,reference
"Housego next Fairfax CFOPUBLISHED: 18 Oct 2012 18:05:00 | UPDATED: 18 Oct 2012 18:52:54PRINT EDITION: 18 Oct 2012
David Housego will take over as Fairfax CFO on December 3
After a two-year break from corporate life, former Worley Parsons finance chief, David Housego, will replace Brian Cassell as Fairfax Media’s CFO in December.
Fairfax Media is the publisher of CFO and The Australian Financial Review.
Mr Housego resigned from Worley Parsons in early 2011 after a decade in the role. He was replaced by Andrew Wood, who will succeed John Grill as CEO of Worley Parsons after its annual general meeting on October 23.
Mr Cassell will stay on with Fairfax to help in the transition. The company said in a statement this is expected to take until the end of 2013.
He was appointed CFO in 2009 following the departure of Sankar Narayan, who is now finance chief at Virgin Australia. Cassell was general manager finance at Rural Press from 1992. He joined Fairfax Media when it merged with Rural Press in 2007.
Mr Housego led the listing of Worley Parsons in 2002, and was finance boss through a period of rapid growth until the GFC.
Prior to Worley Parsons he worked as a management accountant at Coca Cola Amatil and before then spent time at news wires AAP and Reuters.
Worley Parsons was one of only a few companies that avoided a capital raising in 2009 due to an overhaul of its working capital controls in 2008. This was implemented after Housego and group treasurer Craig Busch experienced the first intimations of the credit crunch on a visit to US to raise debt in 2007.
The business suffered with the appreciation in the Australian dollar as well as a slowdown in its electricity division in North America due to the recession and uncertainty over the carbon price.
In its 2009-10 full year results the company announced its first decline in profit since listing.

"A few bright spots in what was an otherwise bleak first half triggered a rally in poker machine maker Aristocrat last week. But it didn't last long.
After pushing the shares up 20c to $1.77 in two days last week, investors took a breather as analysts warned of further declines in domestic sales and a slow earnings recovery in the highly competitive US market.
Aristocrat shares closed down 5c to $1.69 on Friday.
JP Morgan analyst Mark Wilson was very bearish about the outlook for Aristocrat and downgraded his earnings forecasts for 2003, 2004 and 2005 by 52 per cent, 23 per cent and 18 per cent respectively after the company posted a $32.9 million loss for the June half, compared to a $41.6 million profit for the previous corresponding period. The loss wasn't as bad as many had feared.
Aristocrat's price-earnings ratio, a multiple of 15.4 times forecast 2004 earnings per share, ""appears high to us given the lack of senior management team, the depressed outlook for Australia, the likely slow rate of progress in the US, and the apparent lack of urgency to appropriately align the cost base to projected revenues"", Mr Wilson said in a research note.
In what could only be described as a disastrous first half for Aristocrat, earnings in Australia, North America and South America fell significantly, heralded by three profit downgrades. At the same time, Aristocrat removed senior management, became embroiled in a legal stoush with former chief executive Des Randall, and was involved in an ASIC investigation of a failed contract in South America.
UBS Warburg analyst Anthony Aboud said he expected domestic profit to fall 7.7 per cent in the second half as poker machine operators cut spending on new machines in response to higher taxes. However, Mr Aboud forecast a significant turnaround in North America, driven by higher sales in Nevada and contributions from machines sold during the first half.
One very bullish analyst was Tony Waters, of CCZ Equities Research.
Mr Waters put a long-term buy recommendation on Aristocrat after the company reported operating cashflow of $33 million, a further 680 machines in the US market, and plans to cut costs by $20 million.
Notwithstanding the grim outlook for the domestic market, Mr Waters said he expected earnings to return to 2001 and 2002 levels in the next two years.

"On November 17, 1914, the German 15th Corps makes a final, desperate attempt to advance against Allied positions in the Ypres Salient, the much-contested region in Flanders, Belgium.
After advancing relatively quickly through Belgium and eastern France during the first weeks of World War I, the Germans were defeated by the Allies in late September 1914 in the Battle of the Marne. The two enemies then began the so-called ""Race to the Sea,"" moving northwards at a hectic pace in order to establish positions with access to the English Channel and the North Sea beyond. On October 19, the Germans launched an offensive aimed at seizing control of Ypres--the fortress city blocking the ports of the English Channel in Flanders--from the British, French and Belgian forces guarding it. For their part, the Allies held fast in their resistance, knowing a defeat would mean the loss of a crucial advantage.
On the last day of October, German cavalry units began a more concentrated attack, kicking the First Battle of Ypres into high gear. Over the next three weeks, the chaotic nature of the fighting only increased its bloody nature, with casualty figures on both sides mounting as the weather grew colder and more blustery. The attempt by the 15th Corps on November 17--which Allied forces repulsed--marked the last movement of the battle, as the Germans thereafter confined themselves to intermittent cannon blasts against the Allied lines. Five days later, amid high winds and blizzards, fighting was suspended completely, and the First Battle of Ypres came to an end after taking the lives of more than 5,000 British and 5,000 German soldiers.",en,reference
"fluticasone propionate oral inhaler, Flovent (Discontinued), Flovent Diskus, Flovent HFA
Omudhome Ogbru, PharmD
Omudhome Ogbru, PharmD
Dr. Ogbru received his Doctorate in Pharmacy from the University of the Pacific School of Pharmacy in 1995. He completed a Pharmacy Practice Residency at the University of Arizona/University Medical Center in 1996. He was a Professor of Pharmacy Practice and a Regional Clerkship Coordinator for the University of the Pacific School of Pharmacy from 1996-99.
Medical and Pharmacy Editor:
GENERIC NAME: fluticasone propionate oral inhaler
BRAND NAMES: Flovent (Discontinued), Flovent Diskus, Flovent HFA
DRUG CLASS AND MECHANISM: Fluticasone propionate is a man-made steroid of the glucocorticoid family which is related to the naturally-occurring steroid hormone, cortisol or hydrocortisone, produced by the adrenal glands. Glucocorticoid steroids have potent anti-inflammatory actions. When used as an inhaler, fluticasone travels to the airways in the lung. In asthmatic patients, the suppression of inflammation within the airways reduces the spasm of muscle cells that surround the airways as well as the accumulation of fluid and cells that accompanies the inflammation which lead to narrowing of the airways. The narrowing makes it difficult to get air into and out of the lungs. When used in lower doses, very little fluticasone is absorbed into the body. When higher doses are used, fluticasone is absorbed and may cause side effects elsewhere in the body. The FDA approved fluticasone in March 1996.
GENERIC AVAILABLE: No
PREPARATIONS: Inhalation aerosol: 44, 110, and 220 mcg/inhalation. Inhalation Powder (Diskhaler): 50, 100, and 250 mcg/inhalation
STORAGE: Fluticasone should be kept at room temperature, 4-30 C (39-86 F), and the aerosol should be shaken well before each use.
PRESCRIBED FOR: Fluticasone is used for the treatment of asthma in patients 4 years of age old or older who require oral steroid treatment. Fluticasone is not used for acute episodes of asthma; a faster acting dilator of the airways such as albuterol (Ventolin, Proventil, Proventil HFA, AccuNeb, Vospire, ProAir) should be used for acute episodes of asthma.
DOSING: Doses vary from patient to patient.
The recommended dose for the aerosol is 88 to 440 mcg twice daily.
The recommended dose for the Diskhaler is 100 to 1000 mcg twice daily. Following administration, the mouth should be rinsed thoroughly with water or mouthwash to minimize dry mouth, irritation of the throat, and hoarseness.
The aerosol inhaler must be cleaned at least once a week.
If a bronchodilator aerosol spray (a spray that causes the airways to expand), for example, albuterol (Proventil; Ventolin), is used, it should be used first, and then 5-15 minutes later fluticasone should be used.
DRUG INTERACTIONS: Ritonavir (Norvir), atazanavir (Reyataz), clarithromycin (Biaxin), indinavir (Crixivan), itraconazole (Sporanox), ketoconazole, nelfinavir (Viracept), and telithromycin (Ketek) may increase levels of fluticasone in the body by reducing the breakdown of fluticasone by liver enzymes. This may increase side effects of fluticasone.
PREGNANCY: Adequate studies of fluticasone during pregnancy have not been done. Fluticasone use during pregnancy should be avoided unless the potential benefit justifies the potential but unknown risk to the fetus.
NURSING MOTHERS: It is not known if fluticasone is secreted in breast milk. Other medications in the same class as fluticasone are secreted into breast milk. It is not known whether the small amounts that may appear in the milk affect the infant.
SIDE EFFECTS: The most common side effects of fluticasone are headache, upper respiratory infections, throat irritation, nasal congestion, nasal discharge, and hoarseness or difficulty speaking. Fluticasone may also cause bronchospasms (wheezing). Bronchospasms should be treated with a rescue inhaler.

"Before Thursday’s Supreme Court ruling on the Affordable Care Act (aka Obamacare), on Tuesday the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia threw out a petition challenging the Environmental Protection Agency’s claim that carbon dioxide is a lethal “pollutant” that endangers public health because it is a greenhouse gas and a factor in global warming.
The Appeals Court decision was based in part on a 2007 Supreme Court ruling that stated the 1970 Clean Air Act empowered the EPA to regulate CO2. This was clumsy claim, given that the Clean Air Act mentions nothing about CO2. In fact, in 1970 scientists deemed CO2 a fertilizer.

"Evidence-Based Building: It's All by Numbers
The Byggmeister Perspective
WegoWise may sound like the latest Hasbro toy, but this web-based energy tracking system is actually a powerful new addition to Byggmeister's green-building toolkit. It is easy to say certain improvements will save energy. Paul and the rest of the Byggmeister crew want to prove it to their clients and themselves. Byggmeister Sustainability Consultant Rachel White and client Dick Jones share both sides of the story and a little bit of inner data-loving geekiness too.
Why did Byggmeister decide to use WegoWise? RW: When you step back and think about how most energy upgrades are done in the residential sector, you think if we do this it will save about X amount each year, but no builder is really looking at hard and fast numbers when they say that. We want to see how much money and energy upgrade X or Y is actually saving, from adding insulation and fixing air leaks, all the way to a complete deep energy retrofit.
How does it work? RW: You enter your utility account information and WegoWise retrieves the data automatically from online bills each month. We had started trying to track that ourselves, asking homeowners to give us the information after we complete an energy project, but it is hard to keep going back for it. This streamlines the whole process and Byggmeister is now offering it as part of our services. We'll set up the accounts, monitor the data, everything. It is free to the homeowner and all the information is shared between us.
How does Byggmeister use the data? RW: WegoWise has great analytical and graphing that allows you to look at total energy usage and compare that to similar buildings in energy usage per square foot. We can compare our portfolio of projects against one another, and we can also compare against the WegoWise broader pool. That gives us real insight by drilling down and seeing how this particular upgrade, like a basement retrofit, actually impacted energy savings. It takes the guesswork out of it and we can take that to future clients and apply it because we have concrete numbers. We call it ""evidence-based building.""
What has the data shown? RW: On a couple of our deep energy retrofit projects, it's very dramatic. Per square foot, they use 60 to 65 percent less energy than my own house uses. That's exactly what we want to see. 50 to 70 percent reduction is the goal with a deep energy retrofit. It impressed me just how much impact those projects actually had.
What the Client Says:
What kind of project did you do with Byggmeister? DJ: We had a tenant in our carriage house apartment that was a hoarder, lots of cats, windows were broken, and there was a water problem. When she left, we said we'd fix it up right and make it as sustainable as possible. We asked around about architects and builders who would be sensitive to our goals and that's how we came to Paul. Since then, we have also done more on our main house to make it more energy efficient, including blower door tests to see where we were losing heat. Kerry [Kostinen] is crazy about that stuff. He'll crawl all over an attic and into any crevice to find air leaks.
Why use WegoWise? DJ: I kept asking Paul, 'I've got this 8500-square-foot house with 11-foot ceilings, how are we doing with these improvements? I want to be the best you've ever done.' We kept wanting to know how we compared to other Byggmeister projects, but Paul didn't have enough data. Byggmeister is actually entering historical data into WegoWise for us so we can do a more substantial evaluation.
What has WegoWise shown you? DJ: The greatest thing is the monthly feedback loop. I can see that my natural gas use is the biggest contributor to our carbon consumption. I saw that my electricity use came down a lot and then back up, which I figured out is behavior related. It's like buying a certain kind of car for the miles per gallon, I want to know this stuff is making a difference. If you're not getting the savings, then you can hunt down the reason.
Have you hunted down energy issues in your house? DJ: I'm always asking questions about what's going on. Like when I realized houseguests had caused our electricity consumption to go up because they were leaving lights on. I've also realized the new boiler we had installed is not as efficient as it should be, so I'm having Byggmeister's plumbing contractor come in to look at it. It's all about working to drive my costs down more and seeing it happen. Everyone can do it. In fact, I think homeowners should eventually be able to say to builders, 'I want to see your WegoWise improvement numbers.'

Remember this one? I began it back in April by joining two lovely fabric lines together...Heather Ross's Far Far Away II and Denyse Schmidt Hope Valley.
Combining the cotton Hope Valley with the heavier linen base Far Far Away worked out really well and they sewed up beautifully together.
Having the gorgeous fairytale fabrics like Rapunzel, Sleeping Beauty and Owl and the Pussycat, I decided I must find a castle to hang this quilt off. Not too far from me is the gorgeous Manyung Art Gallery that looks just like a miniature castle don't you think?!
To go along with the fairytale theme I wanted to quilt this one in a bit of a fanciful manner, so I did a curvy zigzag over every seam...
and then used stipple stitch in the fairytale blocks only (click on the photo's to get a better look!).
The back of the quilt was designed by using leftovers from my stash piles plus an extra yard of orange and purple.
I'm really happy with how it turned out.
A finish always feel great! xo",en,unknown
"The internet is a strange place. Intelligent, aware people like me quite easily approve extraction of money from their bank accounts by invisible means, and its almost simultaneous crediting to other people's bank accounts. And then, after a time of anxiety or confidence, depending on your personal level of paranoia, you receive a product or service that you consider roughtly equivalent in value to what you paid. It's not called internet shopping for nothing.
Then there's crowdsourcing. Many people using crowdsourcing to raise money offer small inducements, often worth much less than the donation. It might only be that your name and generosity will recorded for posterity. In that sense it's a bit like raising money for charity, except that the charity doesn't have to be registered and the money raised is usually supposed to fund a very specific thing. Sometimes people using crowdsourcing to raise funds will be offering a product that will only be available if the full amount is received so the project can go ahead. I suppose I'd assume if it doesn't go ahead I'd get the money I'd pledged back. I'd certainly assume that if it did go ahead I would get the goods that I'd paid for (usually paid more than they were worth because I believed in the cause) in my pledge.
And (you know where this is going, don't you?) there is trust involved. When the person who is running the scheme is very well-known, both personally and digitally to the pledgers, there is a high level of trust. And the companies who handle the pedges and access the bank accounts of pledgers also have a high level of trust in the community. One of these companies is Pozible. If you're not familiar with the idea of crowdsourcing their home page will give you an idea of how it works. If you're supporting the launch of an EP and you pledge over a certain amount you'll get a copy. If you're supporting a play at a fringe festival and you pledge over a certain amount you get a ticket. Makes lots of sense, and I see that the Queensland Literary Awards, replacing those that were axed by the new premier, have raised $142% of their goal at Pozible (Yay crowdsourcing!).
A successful Pozible project in 2011 was Ton of Wool. In the words of the organiser, Kylie Gusset:
Processing wool in Australia is fast becoming a dying art, and wool needs to stay in Australia for creation from sheep to skein in order to support small farmers and micro business.
The successful project will ensure that your money will be put into directly paying the farmer, scour, fibre processor, mill and transport companies. The whole project occurs within the 03 area code - grown in Tasmania, processed and milled in Victoria.
1 Ton Of Wool - Why so much?
1 ton of wool is being processed because that's the smallest amount we can get through a commercial scour. We're a grain of sand in their usual beach of processing, so we're rather lucky to get a foot in their door.
I was happy to subscribe, and I promoted the project to friends and through the NSW Knitters' Guild. I was very happy with the three skeins of undyed wool I received back in April: soft, smooth, buttery. But I've recently realised that a lot of people who ordered dyed skeins haven't received anything. It was very galling for these pledgers (shall we call them customers?) when the wool was offered for sale at the Bendigo Sheep and Wool Show in July, but they couldn't get any response to pleas for a delivery date for something they paid for more than twelve months ago. This week Kylie responded to some questions on her Ravelry page:
” You’ve taken peoples money in return for goods. That falls under “business transaction”. ”
i’m wondering if that is what is the whole problem here. see, i used pozible. a crowdsource funding site. i took pledges in return for rewards. it doesn’t fall under business transaction. for example, as far as i know, consumer affairs in this instance is unable to do anything if someone who pledged wanted to make a complaint.
As I say, I'm not a lawyer, but this seems very disingenuous to me. Taking money in return for a promise of goods sounds like business to me. She has said that she still has to process 60 of the 400 orders - that's nearly 1 in 7. This woman is in business as a dyer, has been for years and she was trusted. More from the Ravelry site:
“We thought we were dealing with a reputable business with a track record.”
i have no track record with crowdsource funding on pozible, cormo, or dealing with wool brokers, farmers, scours, or wool processors. spinning mill? sort of, but TON OF WOOL is a different beast entirely. i used to dye sock yarn (and i’m looking forward to getting those days back)
now, together, we’re making history.
But that's not all that the 400 people who supported her were paying for. Sure, we 'got' that this was an important moral and environmental issue. Air miles, supporting local growers and businesses, yada yada yada. But we were also after the wool that we paid for. I'm not sure why that's such a complex concept.",en,web
"PEMBROKE — A new executive director. A revamped board of trustees. A renewed focus on supporting existing businesses.
The perfect ingredients, say both tenants and managers of the Carolina Commerce and Technology Center, to ensure the business park located just outside Pembroke has a bright future.
“Starting out, a priority has been to focus efforts on supporting our existing businesses and ensure that COMtech remains a truly special place,” said Ryan Nance, the park’s executive director since April 1. “Significant investments have been made here, so it’s important that our actions add direct value.”
Nance, who is a former project manager for the Lumber River Council of Governments, told The Robesonian earlier this week that improving economies, both nationally and in the state, have businesses talking about expanding and relocating rather than talking about closing their doors. He said that since becoming COMtech’s executive director, he has fielded numerous calls and emails from businesses interested in what the park has to offer.
“Right now, we are working to revamp and create new marketing tools,” said Nance, who earns a base salary and also has incentives in his contract. “Upgrading our website to highlight COMtech businesses, park infrastructure, and assets of our towns and regional economy will help. Interactive park maps and a smartphone app will be developed to stay competitive. We are now registered with LinkedIn, which is an easy and inexpensive way to expand our network and recruiting efforts.”
There are 41 businesses with about 1,000 employees located in the 700-acre park that began operating in 2001, and is designed to provide homes to technology-focused businesses, industry, educational facilities and business incubators.
Until the hiring of Nance, COMtech had been without a full-time executive director since October, when Ken Windley, a former Robeson County manager, resigned after his salary was cut from $90,000 to $30,000 as a result of county Board of Commissoners reducing funding to COMtech. The park was temporarily managed by Tony Normand, its first executive director, and Ronnie Hunt, the chairman of COMtech’s board of directors.
When Nance took over, he inherited a newly established fee structure for tenants that most are now happy with; a revamped board of directors that now includes two representatives from a newly formed COMtech Landowners Association; and a move back to the park’s original mission of supporting economic growth and job creation not just in Pembroke, but throughout Robeson County.
“Everyone is now on the same page,” Nance said. “The grand vision for COMtech is to serve as a 21st century educational resource and to provide customized training. Its growing capacity is a key resource for the county, and what matters is to grow jobs for the county.”
Hunt, who has served as chairman of COMtech’s board of directors for 13 years, sees a bright future for COMtech under Nance’s leadership.
“He is energetic and learning fast,” Hunt said. “Most of the problems we have had in the past have been worked out and fixed. We’re now moving ahead.”
Hunt believes if the park “develops to full fruition,” it will be worth the struggle it has been to make the project a success.
“We have the infrastructure now in place,” he said. “What we need is a good technology-based company to locate here. If we could land a good technology company, it would just be time before other types of businesses would be built around it.”
Ray Townsend is chairman of the COMtech Landowners Association and a member of COMech’s board of directors.
““I’m optimistic since the new association has formed,” said Townsend, whose wife Debra owns Riverwood pre-elementary school, located at COMtech since 2006. “The appointment of our chairman and vice chairman to COMtech’s board of directors is conducive for good things to happen.
“The concept of COMtech is good and it’s good for the county,” he said. “I know that there were some things that weren’t going well in the past, but we are moving ahead. We’re moving forward and not looking back.”
“The ingredients for success are here, as our communities are rich in culture, faith, and resources,” Nance said. “Although there are many pathways to success, our ability to attract private investment from outside the region is critical. That will help retain homegrown talent and grow the pie, instead of just moving things around.
“Together, we’ll make it happen, and I’m very optimistic about our potential, especially given the amount of early support from around the county. Whether it comes from the business community or localgovernment, everyone’s ready to get things rolling again.”",en,web

For the past year and a half I have had an assistantship with Deryl Bailey’s Empowered Youth Programs. This is an enrichment program for underrepresented elementary to high school students in the Clarke and surrounding counties. My responsibilities include developing a curriculum and co-teaching character education to middle and high school minority students, administering educational and adjustment assessments to gauge student progress and program efficacy, developing scoring instruments, serving as the office manager who serves as a liaison between program director and program staff/volunteers, maintaining contact with teachers and school counselors at one school to gauge progress of program participants from that school, gathering literature and information to be used in writing research papers, and aiding in writing research papers based on collected program data.
Family Ties to UGA:
My father works as an agricultural engineer for the USDA at a research station in Watkinsville. My mother works as an office manager in the African Studies department. My sister just graduated from UGA with a bachelor’s degree in psychology. She will be doing a master’s at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte in Industrial/Organizational Psychology next fall.
I chose to attend UGA because...
...the program I am in is really good. It is ranked fifth in the nation and has internationally known faculty. I knew that I would receive excellent training here. Also, because I got my master’s degree in the department, I already knew the ins and outs and I needed less time to adjust. This has allowed me the opportunity to do things like take a recent trip to Sri Lanka to help provide tsunami relief. I am also blessed to have my immediate family living nearby, and after my experience in Sri Lanka, I realized how important that is to me.
My favorite things to do on campus are...
...to go to the Ramsey Center. I don’t get as much time there as I’d like, but I make it there as often as possible. In the past, I’ve taken advantage of the weight room, the climbing wall (my favorite activity to date), a belly dancing class, and a yoga class.
I also love the little pond near the life sciences building. When I need a time out, I walk there from Aderhold and sit with the turtles and fish. I especially like the catfish that “sleeps” on its back.
My final love (or perhaps addiction) is the Jittery Joe’s at the SLC. I have to fight to stay away from the white chocolate mocha.
When I have free time, I like...
...to share stories over dinner and wine with my friends, to go dancing with friends in Atlanta, and to indulge in my Sunday routine of going to my parents’ house after church for a lunch with the family.
The craziest thing I've done is...
...go to Sri Lanka to help provide tsunami relief. Because my special interest is in international psychology, I had been doing some group counseling with diverse refugees in Atlanta, so after the tsunami hit in South Asia, I really felt an urge to do something. I filled out an application circulated by the American Psychological Association and sent it in. I did not have trauma experience nor am I licensed yet, but I got accepted. I had not even checked with my professors before I applied, but they gave me their blessings. Within a month I found myself sitting on a plane thinking, “What am I doing?” Once I landed and the work began though, the fear melted and I began to connect with all those around me. It felt like I was able to give the people a momentary refuge after all the chaos that continues even today. I will never forget the adults’ tears of sorrow nor the beautiful smiling faces of “my” children. This opportunity was truly a blessing to me. It was a reminder to spend time and energy on the important people in my life since they are never guaranteed to be around. In the end, I had a remarkable life-altering experience, and I had an opportunity to do some good along the way.
My favorite place to study is...
...at home alone. There, I have everything I need like comfortable clothes, snacks, my hot tea, my TV when I need a break, etc. Also, with my schedule I spend so little time at home (I work 12+ hours most days) that it is nice when I don’t have to leave for once.
If I could share an afternoon with anyone, I would love to share it with...
...my maternal grandparents. Both of them currently live in a rather remote area of Ethiopia. My grandfather is 93 years old, and his health is beginning to fail. My grandmother is in her 80’s and battling cancer. Because I have lived abroad since I was four years old, I have not had the opportunity to spend much quality time with them. I would like to hold my grandfather’s hand and feed him his lunch. I would share my life with my grandmother and ask if she has any words of wisdom for me.
The one UGA experience I will always remember will be...
...working in the Aderhold counseling center, where I do my clinical work, talking and joking with the other clinicians. We spend so much time together that we really get to know one another and grow comfortable with each other during all the late nights. These are a great group of people that understand what my day-to-day life is like, and once it starts getting later we all get a little delirious and silly, especially when we are stressed out.",en,books

Water chemistry is employed during cruises to look for various things of interest to Oceanographers like temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll.
Temperature and salinity can be used to tell us something about where the water comes from, for example warmer water originates from the hotter equator and colder water from the poles. Salinity is a measure of how “salty” the water is; new fresh water from ice melting for example lowers this, whereas evaporating water at the tropics raises this value. Salty water is of particular interest in understanding global ocean movements as it is heavier than fresh water and sinks, helping to create an ocean transport system around the world.
Dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll can be used as a measure of how biologically productive an area is. Levels of chlorophyll are related to microscopic phytoplankton (tiny plants) that live near the surface of the ocean.
Phytoplankton create their own food much the same as their larger relatives on the land, using photosynthesis to harvest the power of the sun to create sugars. Chlorophyll levels are of interest to researchers in many fields, both biological and chemical. In areas of upwelling, where water is brought up from the depths of the ocean, it carries with it essential nutrients for the phytoplankton to grow. A high chlorophyll count can help show where these nutrient upwelling regions are, or alternatively where nutrients from the atmosphere are entering through the surface of the ocean. As photosynthesis uses up carbon dioxide, the phytoplankton could help in a small way to lowering global warming if there is enough of them in the right area. Polar regions have some the highest chlorophyll levels in the world, helping to provide a strong start to the food chain and feed the large range of life living below the surface. Oxygen in the oceans is an essential part of animal life in the seas as much as on land, low levels can be potentially dangerous to many species. It is important for the safe future of all Oceans that we keep recording all these things and further develop our understanding of how these great blue oceans work.
The water to be analysed is collected using a piece of apparatus called a “CTD” which is lowered on a steel wire to the ocean depths. This consists of thick grey plastic tubes called Niskins that are mounted on a steel frame called a Rosette. A maximum of 24 Niskins can be “fired” at any given depth from a chosen location. Each Niskin collects the sample of the water traversing through it by snapping shut two water tight bungs at either end. It is common practice to collect the water as the Rosette is ascending to the surface, this is because areas of interest spotted on the descent can be the ones captured. This water is then analysed onboard the ship using different techniques. Oxygen is measured by titration using the Winkler method which traps all the oxygen in the water. Chlorophyll is measured by filtering the water through filter paper and measuring the green bits in leftover cells with a fluorometer. Salinity is tested with a clever instrument that measures all the various salts within the water.

"Curtains Up Pagosa! will be holding open auditions for the musical theater classic “Man of La Mancha” on Friday, Sept. 28, from 2-7 p.m. in the Pagosa Springs High School music room.
Even if you have not been on stage for many years, or perhaps enjoy singing and would like to try your skills in acting, this is your golden opportunity to shine. This musical, for adult or high school actors, is filled with beautiful music, powerful drama, delightful comedy, and a message of hope.
Those wishing to audition should prepare a song to sing for the audition committee. An accompanist will be provided, so please bring music with you. The audition will also require you to read a short excerpt from the script provided by the committee. “Auditions are not meant to be intimidating in any way,” says production director Dale Johnson. “We try to make it fun and keep things relaxed for those auditioning, realizing that almost always they come in feeling nervous. It is our intent to make it an experience that encourages people to audition again in the future.”
Curtains Up Pagosa! gives the opportunity for members of the community to participate in community theater in a multitude of ways, whether they are proficient as actors, costumers, set builders, lighting technicians, choreographers, sales, or are movers and haulers.
“We need volunteers who bring a variety of skills and enjoy interacting with other wonderful people who share a dedication to the arts,” says Johnson.
The story of “Man of La Mancha,” based on a book by Miguel de Cervantes titled “Don Quixote,” takes place in the 16th century during the Spanish Inquisition. Cervantes, along with his man servant has been thrown into prison for mocking the Inquisition. While in jail, he awaits trial, though still in possession of his belongings that include a trunk filled with costumes, stage makeup and props, and a prized manuscript. His fellow inmates confiscate his belongings and threaten to steal his precious manuscript. When he protests, they offer him a mock trial to determine whether or not he will be allowed to keep it.
In his own defense, Cervantes presents the play, “Don Quixote,” a story about an aging, slightly mad, country squire in La Mancha who has read too many novels about knights and chivalry and decides to become a knight-errant himself. He calls himself “Don Quixote de la Mancha” and his manservant becomes “Sancho Panza.” Together, they travel La Mancha in search of adventure and in defense of virtue. Cervantes engages his fellow inmates in helping him act out the play as he tells the story. What follows is a delightful, funny, ultimately touching tale.
“Man of La Mancha” features music that has a decisive Spanish flare and contains many recognizable tunes. One of its most memorable songs is The Impossible Dream, a song that depicts hope and courage even when fighting against all odds. Ultimately, though Cervantes faces the Inquisition and possible death, he touches the lives of those who await the same fate and gives them hope.

"While I recognize that the military is a unique institution with its own codes of conduct and ethos, this policy, tacit though it may be, of stigmatizing mental illness has got to end.
The environment of the yoga class is particularly ripe for trauma triggering because of its inherently intimate nature, arising out of the integration of mind and body and the teacher's position as a leader and spiritual or physical authority, and the fact that trauma can be held in the body.
The brain has ways of coping with and reversing the effects of psychological and physical maltreatment, but a number of factors influence how well and how quickly people bounce back. One of those factors is the individual's support system.
Practicing yoga has changed me, made me calmer, less anxious, more equanimous. It's given me a physiological way to deal with trauma that was otherwise unavailable to me, and as a teacher, I now have some tools that I can share with others who've experienced trauma.
The complexity and mystery of the number seven has inspired me to explore its connections to human nature in a series of upcoming blog posts, each geared toward the unique experiences of post-war Veterans.
Tattoos and a checkered past do not automatically make you a bad example for your children, just as a blemish free life and ink free skin does not automatically make you a good one.
Trauma is ubiquitous in our world. Sometimes, however, its magnitude is so profound or persistent that, while recovery is possible, a person's life is forever changed.
My own symptoms of post traumatic stress had faded within six months or so of coming home, and I was relieved. Then came my delayed reaction to a 10-year passage of time from the day I drove over the berm into Iraq as a soldier, sparked by that photo, and it all washed away.
I never thought quitting was in my DNA. I never thought about giving up. I was strong. I played football at West Point. I was an officer in the U.S. Army. I had a wonderful marriage and two beautiful children. But war can change you. War can turn you inside out.
There may be no more powerful force to influence public awareness and perception than the entertainment industry. Most of us probably don't even realize how much our attitudes and assumptions are informed by what we see on television and in movies.
How many millions of children who were hurt or neglected themselves grow up hopeless, hate-filled, and continue the cycle of hurting others? All children deserve to be allowed and encouraged to dream by the adults around them in their homes, schools, and communities.
I am doing this so that the public can witness the trauma that follows war. Witness. Because this trauma is as much yours as it is ours. Witness and own it. Witnessing breaks the isolation trauma creates. Witnessing furthers the healing of individuals and of our society.
Many questions still remain and more research needs to be done, but it's misleading at best and intellectually lazy at worst to suggest there is no good scientific evidence about the nature of dream content. What, then, does science actually know about dreams?
As more veterans develop PTSD, we must resist the urge to treat this disorder with a cookie cutter solution. Through coaching can provide treatment that is tailored to a veteran's unique war-related trauma and can help our Warriors thrive.
The scientists who will be working on the National BRAIN Initiative Project will be conducting pure scientific research to unlock the mysteries of the brain.
Many Serbs are not truly interested in the political fate of Kosovo, instead seeing themselves as hostages of Kosovo's drama for decades. It is arguable that these new pressures provoke old wounds and revive dormant traumas.",en,books
"- There is a drunk on Main Avenue, slumped
in front of the Union Gospel Mission.
He is dreaming of pintos the color of wine

but I think I know him.
Didn't he make songs people still sing
in their sleep?
Didn't coyotes beg him for new songs
to give to the moon?
Didn't he dance all night once and laugh
when the women suddenly turned
shy at dawn
Didn't he make a song just for me,
one blessed by its being sung only once?
If he would lift his face
I could see his eyes, see
if he's singing now
a soul-dissolving song.

and ORAL SOLUTION
The original use of this medication was for treating partial seizures in humans but not long after its introduction, it was found to have use in treating “neuropathic pain” (the burning and tingling sensations that come from damaged nerves.)
As with many human drugs, this one has found its way into veterinary medicine where it is also used as a seizure control drug, either alone or in combination with other anti-seizure drugs, or as an adjunct in the control of chronic pain, especially arthritis pain. Gabapentin is also used in animals preoperatively to minimize pain experienced after surgery.
The actual chemistry of how this drug works in the body is still unknown.
Gabapentin can be used in both dogs and cats. The dosing is very different depending on if gabapentin is being used for seizure control or for pain management. For pain control gabapentin is typically started at once daily dosing but can be increased to two or even three times daily. Further, anti-seizure doses are three to ten times higher than analgesic doses at least to start.
Gabapentin’s anti-seizure capabilities have met with mixed reviews among veterinary neurologists. For pain control, gabapentin is usually used in conjunction with other pain relievers which may later be tapered away. Unfortunately, it is common to develop tolerance to gabapentin so that the pain relief dose must be increased as time goes on. How long a dose is adequate before it must be increased is highly individual.
Sedation is the chief side effect of concern though it is usually temporary and resolves in a few days after the patient's body gets used to the medication. Diarrhea has also been reported.
In mice, male mice on gabapentin were found to have an increased incidence of pancreatic cancer. It is unknown if this finding holds for other species. This information has not hindered FDA approval for human use of gabapentin.
Gabapentin can cause a false positive reading on urine dipstick tests for urinary protein.
For chronic pain relief, gabapentin is best started in combination with other pain relievers but after a time often the other pain relievers can be discontinued and gabapentin is effective as a sole agent. This may not be possible for conditions where the pain is progressively worse.
Oral antacids will hinder absorption of gabapentin into the body by up to 20% so it is important to separate administration of these two medications by at least 2 hours.
Concurrent use of hydrocodone or morphine, both narcotics, with gabapentin can increase the effectiveness of gabapentin. Concurrent use of gabapentin with hydrocodone will decrease the effectiveness of the hydrocodone.
Gabapentin may be given with or without food.
Doses for cats are small enough that a special compounding pharmacy may need to prepare an appropriate product.
Gabapentin is removed from the body via the kidneys. If it is to be used in a patient with kidney insufficiency the dose will need to be modified or another product should be selected.
Gabapentin is not safe for use in pregnancy but should be safe for use in lactation.
Gabapentin should not be abruptly discontinued after long term use as seizures can be precipitated. Instead gabapentin should be gradually tapered off over a couple of weeks.
Gabapentin oral suspension is sweetened with xylitol which has toxic properties in the dog. The issue can be avoided by having liquid formulations compounded rather than using the commercially available oral liquid.

"A two-way radio can be your best friend if you get into trouble aboard your boat. It’s the surest way to call for help, explained Coast Guard Lt. j.g. Fannie Wilks at the Sector Command Center on Staten Island.
The Coast Guard has sophisticated radio equipment to continuously monitor and record transmissions on the marine emergency frequency, Channel 16, and pinpoint your location.
Also, nearby boats are likely to hear your emergency call and give aid quickly while rescuers are on the way.
Cell phones are handy but their range offshore is very limited, Wilks said. The Coast Guard VHF radio coverage, however, can extend 40 nautical miles offshore, and more, she said. Ships at sea use other frequencies with greater range.
While boat radios are relatively affordable — beginning at under $100 for a handheld and $200 for a fixed mount unit — they are not toys and must be used with courtesy and safety in mind. Making false emergency calls is a criminal offense.
In general, Channel 16 is the emergency and hailing channel. You can call another boat on 16, but then move to another channel to conduct your business. Don’t tie up Channel 16. Channel 9 is listed as an alternate hailing frequency for boaters.
Boat radios are useful in a number of ways. The Coast Guard will announce safety bulletins and updates on bad weather on Channel 16, and marine radios come with National Weather Service channels built in.
In the harbor area, commercial vessels will use Channel 13 to talk to one another and, as a safety measure, to broadcast their intentions. You might need to alert a ship or tug towing a barge to your own situation; Channel 13 is the quickest way to do that, said Capt. Bill McGovern. As a Sandy Hook harbor pilot, he is one of those who guide ships into and out of the harbor.
Skippers asking for ""radio checks"" on Channel 16 are a sore point with the Coast Guard. Instead, use one of the channels designated for recreational boats.
For a list of channels and their uses, go to navcen.uscg.gov and click on ""Maritime Information."" Also check boatus.com/foundation and go to ""Boater’s Toolbox.""

Hell no. I run them just long enough to grind out what I want from them (exalted status for quartermaster goods, enough tokens to get a recipe I want, etc) and then never run them again.I hate the repetitive grind of dailies. I do them because I have no choice if I want the rewards they offer, and once I have those I never want to see them again. Only one of my toons has a blazing hippogriff, and its going to stay that way because I never want to step foot in Molten Front ever again.

"This webinar will address the practical issues involved in in-plant validating processes. The session will also include the scientific, technical justification and fundamental aspects of designing and conducting the process with interpretation of results.
Why Should You Attend:
Validation is a fundamental component of HACCP, and is required by USDA-FSIS and is included in the Food Safety Modernization Act. Validation has been confused with other HACCP activities including monitoring and verification, but is fundamentally different from these other activities. Validation allows the processor to determine if their investment in food safety interventions are producing the intended effect, namely assuring the safety of the product. Given the investment in food safety and the value of these programs to maintaining the image of the brand, it is important to determine that the programs are delivering their intended benefits. Validation may require a significant investment by a company, and it is important to determine that validation procedures are sufficient to meet both the processors needs and regulatory requirements.
Areas Covered in the Seminar:
- Theoretical and Regulatory Basis for Validation
- Scientific and Technical Justification
- In-process demonstration, including experimental design
- Interpretation of Results
- Reporting results of in-plant validation",en,reference
"If a person acquires or transfers ownership of a farm during a taxable year for which a claim may be filed under this section, the person may file a claim under this section based on the person's liability for the property taxes levied on the person's qualifying acres for the taxable year to which the claim relates.
A claimant shall claim the credit under this section on a form prepared by the department and shall submit any documentation required by the department. On the claim form, the claimant shall certify all of the following:
The number of qualifying acres for which the credit is claimed.
The location and tax parcel number for each parcel on which the qualifying acres are located.
That the qualifying acres are covered by a farmland preservation agreement or located in a farmland preservation zoning district, or both.
That the qualifying acres are part of a farm that complies with applicable state soil and water conservation standards, as required by s. 91.80
No credit may be allowed under this section unless it is claimed within the time period under s. 71.75 (2)
The maximum amount of the credits that may be claimed under this section in any fiscal year is $27,007,200. If the total amount of eligible claims exceed this amount, the excess claims shall be paid in the next succeeding fiscal year to ensure that the limit specified in this paragraph is not exceeded.
For the 2011-2012 fiscal year, and for every succeeding fiscal year, the department shall prorate the per acre amounts specified in sub. (2)
based on the department's estimated amount of eligible claims that will be filed for that fiscal year, and to account for any excess claims from the preceding fiscal year that are required to be paid under par. (f)
If the payment to which an eligible claimant is entitled under sub. (2)
is delayed because the claim was an excess claim, as described in par. (f)
, the claimant is not entitled to any interest payment under s. 71.82
with regard to the delayed claim or with regard to any other refund to which the claimant is entitled if that other refund claim is claimed on the same income tax return as the credit under this section.
The department may enforce the credit under this section and may take any action, conduct any proceeding, and proceed as it is authorized in respect to taxes under this chapter. The income and franchise tax provisions in this chapter relating to assessments, refunds, appeals, collection, interest, and penalties apply to the credit under this section.

, Wis. adm. code.
Employers required to withhold. 71.64(1)(a)(a)
Every employer at the time of payment of wages to an employee shall deduct and withhold from such wages, without regard for federal insurance contributions act deductions therefrom, an amount determined in accordance with tables to be prepared by the department under sub. (9)
. The secretary may grant permission to employers who do not desire to use the withholding tax tables provided by the department to determine the amount of tax to be withheld by use of a method of withholding other than the withholding tax tables, provided such method will withhold from each employee substantially the same amount as would be withheld by use of the withholding tax tables. Employers who desire to determine the amount of tax to be withheld by a method other than by use of the withholding tax tables shall obtain permission from the secretary before the beginning of a payroll period for which the employer desires to withhold the tax by such other method. Applications for use of such other method must be accompanied by evidence establishing the need for the use of such method.
An employer may, at his or her discretion, deduct and withhold from any one payment of wages in a month, in the case of an employee paid more often than once during any month, the total amount which the employer reasonably estimates he or she will be required to withhold under this section from such employee during that month. Permission from the secretary under par. (a)
is not needed by any employer acting under this paragraph.
Withholding from marital income shall be allocated between taxpayers in the same manner that income is allocated or would be allocated.
(2) Changing amount of withholding by written agreement between employer and employee. 71.64(2)(a)(a)
In addition to the amount required to be deducted and withheld, an employer and employee may agree in writing that an additional amount shall be withheld from the employee's wages. The amount deducted and withheld pursuant to such an agreement shall be considered as an amount required to be deducted and withheld for all purposes of this subchapter.
In lieu of the amount required to be deducted and withheld under this section, an employer and employee may agree in writing on a form prescribed and provided by the department that a lesser amount be withheld from the employee's wages if:
The employee determines that the lesser amount approximates the employee's anticipated income tax liability for the year.
The employee sends a copy of the completed agreement form to the department within 10 days after it is filed with the employer.
The agreement expires on April 30 of the following year, for calendar year taxpayers, or 4 months following the close of their fiscal year, for fiscal year taxpayers.
Department may void agreement.
If the department determines that an agreement under par. (b)
would result in an insufficient amount of tax being withheld, the department may void the agreement by notification to the employer and employee.
(3) Withholding from pension or sick pay plan.
If a payee furnishes written notification to a payor of any pension or to a 3rd-party payor of any sick pay plan that the payee desires to have Wisconsin income tax withheld from the pension or sick pay plan, the payor shall withhold from each pension payment or sick pay payment an amount in accordance with the withholding tables or the amount that the payee designates to the payor. The amount withheld from each payment may not be less than $5. For purposes of this subsection, ""pension"" includes any retirement payment plan, and ""sick pay"" includes any amount paid to an employee as remuneration or paid instead of remuneration for any period when the employee is temporarily absent from work because of sickness or personal injuries. Payors withholding under this subsection are employers for all purposes of this section and shall withhold, remit and be subject to the other requirements of an employer in withholding Wisconsin income tax from employees.
(4) Withholding from payments made to entertainers.
For purposes of this section, all payments made to entertainers and entertainment corporations are presumed subject to withholding unless the recipient provides to the person making the payment a written statement, on a form prescribed by the department, certifying that the payment is exempt under sub. (6) (b)
or s. 71.05 (2)
(5) Withholding from entertainer in absence of bond or cash deposit.
If no bond or cash deposit is made under s. 71.80 (15) (b)
by an entertainer or entertainment corporation at the time of payment of wages to an entertainer, the employer shall either withhold the amount for which a bond should have been provided under s. 71.80 (15) (b)
or deduct and withhold the tax reflected by the proper withholding table. If the entertainer establishes to the department's satisfaction that a lower rate is more appropriate, the department shall notify the employer to withhold at the lower rate. The department may notify the employer that it waives the withholding requirement on the amount specified. Payments to an entertainment corporation shall be withheld at the rate of 6% unless the payee establishes to the satisfaction of the department that a lower rate is appropriate, in which case the department may notify the employer to withhold at a lower rate.
(6) Withholding from payments made to nonresidents. 71.64(6)(a)(a)
At the time of payment of wages to a nonresident employee which wages were derived from the performance of services both within and without the state, the employer shall deduct and withhold from the wages derived from the performance of services within the state the amount as reflected by the proper withholding table.
No amount shall be withheld from the wages paid to a nonresident employee for services performed in this state if the employer reasonably estimates that during that calendar year the employee will earn less than $1,500; but whenever it appears that the employee will earn more than $1,500 in this state during the calendar year, the employer shall withhold, from wages paid thereafter, such additional amounts as the employer reasonably estimates will be required to offset the amounts not withheld from previous payments.
(7) Special withholding arrangements.
The secretary of revenue, acting within his or her discretion, may authorize special withholding arrangements in hardship cases resulting from situations in which persons, domiciled in Wisconsin, are subjected to withholding in some other state by reason of the performance of substantial personal services in such other state, pursuant to s. 71.07 (7)
The employer of any employee domiciled in a state with which Wisconsin has reciprocity under s. 71.05 (2)
is not required to withhold under this subchapter from the wages earned by such employee in this state.
See also s. Tax 2.02
, Wis. adm. code.
This subchapter shall not apply to any county fair association in regard to any employee receiving less than $500 annually in wages or salary from the association.
The department of corrections is not required to withhold under sub. (1)
from wages paid to an inmate working in a prison listed in s. 302.01
, and if the inmate's wages do not exceed $2,000 per year the department of corrections is not required under s. 71.65 (3)
to file reports relating to those wages.
The department shall prepare, promulgate and publish in the official state paper, without regard to the requirements of ch. 227
, rules establishing withholding tables prepared on a weekly, biweekly, semimonthly, monthly, and daily or miscellaneous pay period basis. Those rules shall also provide instructions for withholding with respect to quarterly, semiannual and annual pay periods.
The department shall from time to time adjust the withholding tables to reflect any changes in income tax rates, any applicable surtax or any changes in dollar amounts in s. 71.06 (1)
resulting from statutory changes, except as follows:
The department may not adjust the withholding tables to reflect the changes in rates in s. 71.06 (1m)
and (2) (c)
and any changes in dollar amounts with respect to bracket indexing under s. 71.06 (2e)
, with respect to changes in rates under s. 71.06 (1m)
and (2) (c)
, and with respect to standard deduction indexing under s. 71.05 (22) (ds)
for any taxable year that begins before January 1, 2000.
The tables shall account for the working families tax credit under s. 71.07 (5m)
. The tables shall be extended to cover from zero to 10 withholding exemptions, shall assume that the payment of wages in each pay period will, when multiplied by the number of pay periods in a year, reasonably reflect the annual wage of the employee from the employer and shall be based on the further assumption that the annual wage will be reduced for allowable deductions from gross income. The department may determine the length of the tables and a reasonable span for each bracket. In preparing the tables the department shall adjust all withholding amounts not an exact multiple of 10 cents to the next highest figure that is a multiple of 10 cents. The department shall also provide instructions with the tables for withholding with respect to quarterly, semiannual and annual pay periods.
See also ss. Tax 2.90

"By Tim Leeds
A local resident charged with embezzling about $20,000 from two nonprofit groups turned himself in Wednesday afternoon.
Douglas Komrosky is charged with felony theft of $20,809.47 from the Fresno Chapter of Walleye Unlimited and Montana Walleye Circuit. He turned himself in about 4 p.m. and was released on his own recognizance, Hill County Sheriff Greg Szudera said. An arraignment has not been scheduled.
Hill County Attorney David Rice said conditions of Komrosky's release include that he be law-abiding, remain in the Havre area and be available to law enforcement personnel at all times.
Komrosky is employed as a paraprofessional with the Havre Public Schools.
A criminal complaint filed by Rice in court Monday alleges that beginning in 1998 Komrosky transferred money from the Fresno Chapter and Walleye Circuit bank accounts to his personal account or wrote checks on the groups' accounts to pay his personal debts.
Komrosky took about $17,000 from the Fresno Chapter account and about $3,000 from the Walleye Circuit account, the criminal complaint said.
The money from the Fresno account, much of which is raised by local fund-raisers, is generally used for maintenance and improvements of the recreation facilities at Fresno Reservoir and other fisheries. The money from Walleye Circuit, which comes from membership dues, is generally used to fund fishing tournaments throughout Montana.
Komrosky told investigators that he had been repaying the money he took by putting cash into the proceeds of a raffle Walleye Unlimited holds each March, the complaint said. Investigators could not find evidence that any additional money had been put into the raffle proceeds, the complaint added.
Rice said no appearances in District Court have been scheduled for Komrosky, but that he doesn't expect it will take long to schedule an initial appearance.
If convicted of the charges, Komrosky could be sentenced to up to 10 years in prison and a $50,000 fine.",en,web

Would love to see him stay for another year but the lad is pure quality and will be at SL at some point. From a cynical point of view maybe better now so we get money for him than at the end of next year when his contract expires.

One of the most expensive fantasy guides out there is the Major League Fantasy Baseball Yearbook and Guide. They tout themselves as the #1 Rated Fantasy Mag, but after reading and comparing it to the competition, it’s clear that whoever rated it #1 is probably on their staff.
While there is some value here, on the whole I do feel you could spend your money much better elsewhere, get a better guide and save a few bucks too. This guide does have several good features and good writers which will help experienced players get value from this guide but most people would benefit from just moving past this below average guide on the new stand. In other words, this is the guide I wish my competitors in a fantasy league would use.
In the following categories – let’s see how it scored.
• Articles - The only word I can use here is pitiful. There is a grand total of one article spanning two pages (most of which are covered with pictures and graphics), and the article is extremely simplistic.
• Top Prospects - Covers 60 prospects, 20 American League guys ready for 2009, 20 National League guys ready for 2009 and 10 of each to expect in 2010.
• Boom and Bust predictions - They offer 3 sleeper picks for each league at each position in the position by position rankings, which isn’t really what this category is about, so it’s a pale attempt. The only other section on predictions is the “Expert Picks” chart where the guide’s fantasy experts offer their predictions for MVPs, Cy Young awards, RoYs, and divisional and world series champions.
• Medical watch - None.
• Cheat Sheets - Check.
• Team Previews – Check.
• Depth Charts - Projected lineups, starters and setup/closers. None.
• Mock Draft - None.
• Position eligibility chart - Yes.
• Park Factors chart - None
• Information Key - Not available for dollar values in auction leagues. A slight explanation for how the capsules were written and by who (they has six writers each who handled a single division) which may skew the values slightly.
• Rankings by positions - Decent, but not great. But this section does contain the guide’s best feature -- grades for each player in each of the standard 5x5 categories.
• Internet updates - None publicized in the magazine.
• Player capsules – Thin -- the philosophy here seems to be that if you can’t say it in two sentences then you shouldn’t say it. Needless to say, you don’t get much flavor or opinion. Alphabetized in a section for hitters and a section for pitchers. Not attached to position by position rankings which makes quick look up easier.
• Bonus features which are nice to have - None.
Upsides: Sold prospect article. Some good writers did the capsules. Grade charts for players’ production in each category.
Downsides: Thin on opinions, thin on articles, thin on content in general, one of the most expensive fantasy guides.
Overall: This is one of the worst, if not the worst, fantasy guides for the buck, but like all guides there are some gems a very experienced player could mine from this guide.

"It may be November, but firefighters continue to battle several wildfires in the area, including a 2½-week-old blaze near Vallecito Reservoir.
The Vallecito Fire, believed to be lightning-caused, was burning mostly along the ground through dead and down trees, according to a news release issued Friday by the U.S. Forest Service.
No homes were considered threatened.
The blaze was first reported Oct. 16 west of Vallecito Reservoir in the San Juan National Forest.
It was burning within the perimeter of the 2002 Missionary Ridge Fire.
Firefighters have been unable to make a direct attack on the fire because of the steep terrain and danger of falling trees from the old burn area.
Instead, firefighters created a bulldozer line to protect homes and private property on Hummingbird Lane and Ho Hum Drive.
The fire was 25 percent contained as of Friday.
Fire activity increased Thursday afternoon, producing a 100-acre run up the head of Jack Creek drainage crossing the Endlich Trail and approaching the Weminuche Wilderness. It produced a vertical smoke column visible from the entire Pine River Valley.",en,web

Blackboard Buys Out Moodlerooms, NetSpot
- By David Nagel, Dian Schaffhauser
Blackboard is buying out two major players in the open source services space: Moodlerooms and NetSpot. Blackboard has also brought onboard Sakai Project founding architect Charles Severance. With these additions, the company is also launching its own open source division: Blackboard Education Open Source Services.
Moving into Open Source Services
Teams from both Moodlerooms and NetSpot will make up Blackboard's new open source group. Both of those companies provide commercial services for institutions that use Moodle, including support, consulting, installation, and hosting services.
""Both Moodlerooms and NetSpot have built strong reputations for high quality service and support, which aligns with our deep focus in these areas and our overall commitment to providing LMS services and hosting globally,"" said Henderson, CTO and president of academic platforms at Blackboard, in a prepared statement. ""This direction allows us to provide the choice of an open source alternative with the benefit of a team of leaders from the open source community to guide our sustained contributions and citizenship in that community.""
""This partnership is an historic moment for our company, our clients and the open source community,"" said Pugliese, CEO of the Moodlerooms, also in a prepared statement. ""Our company organizes around the principles of affordability, openness and sustainability. Working with Blackboard means that clients using one or more LMS systems can do so more affordably, with greater investment in interoperability and deeper integration between products. Our work will also continue to send a significant portion of revenue directly to Moodle's core team to help support the improvement of a free and open product.""
According to Blackboard, ""Leaders from Moodlerooms, NetSpot and Blackboard signed a Statement of Principles affirming that their work will continue to include regular contributions to the open source community in the form of code contributions, financial support to the Moodle Trust, and support for community gatherings including Moodlemoots.""
""The decision of Moodlerooms and NetSpot to work under Blackboard may sound very strange at first to anyone in this industry,"" said Martin Dougiamas, founder of Moodle and managing director of Moodle Pty Ltd., in a statement released today by Blackboard, ""but it's my understanding that these three companies have some good plans and synergies. I'm happy to say that Moodlerooms and NetSpot will remain Moodle Partners, and have promised to continue providing Moodle services, participating in the community, and contributing financially to Moodle exactly as they always have.""
Not everybody will be thrilled by the news that Blackboard has bought Moodlerooms. Keystone College is just now completing its transition to Joule, Moodlerooms' online platform. ""I have mixed feelings on the acquisition of Moodlerooms by Blackboard,"" said Kurt Sussman, director of educational technology. ""While I feel that having the backing and resources of a large educational service provider could be beneficial to Moodlerooms and ultimately its customers, I am also concerned because dissatisfaction with the product and less-than-optimal customer service and support is why our institution moved from Blackboard to Moodlerooms in the first place."" The Pennsylvania college reported it expects to shut down its Blackboard server ""for good"" May 31, 2012.
LMS competitors are also assessing the move by Blackboard into the open source space. Josh Coates, CEO of Instructure, which develops the Canvas LMS, said he views the acquisition as Blackboard's decision to ""give up on innovation"" and focus on the commoditizing of the LMS. ""Moodle, Sakai, Angel, Blackboard 9.1--it's all the same to them now,"" he said. ""They want to make their money by offering generic IT service and software. Given Blackboard's decline in LMS market share, I suppose it's the only option they had.""
Blackboard Looks to Sakai
Blackboard is also eyeing the Sakai marketplace, although Henderson declined to provide specifics. The company has appointed Charles Severance as chief Sakai strategist to head up its Sakai initiatives. Severance previously served as executive director of the Sakai Foundation and was the founding chief architect of the Sakai Project. He's currently a board member of the Sakai Foundation, and he serves as clinical associate professor at the University of Michigan's School of Information.
Referring to Severance as a ""cultural ambassador,"" Henderson said he would act as a ""guide"" into the Sakai community and help Blackboard assemble its technology team ""as we plan our investment and future offerings.""
""We're excited to welcome Chuck to our team,"" said Blackboard CEO Michael Chasen. ""He's been a tireless leader in the learning technology and standards communities, and he brings a tremendous amount of expertise and insight that will be critical to our support for institutions using Sakai.""
Severance has been an advocate for open standards in education technology and has worked closely with the IMS Global Learning Consortium as part of that work. The Consortium, which promotes open standards in education technology, was the primary client of Blackboard in its earliest days. Since then, the company has participated in multiple standards initiatives managed by the Consortium.
""Blackboard is doing some extraordinary work and challenging preconceived notions of how companies can add real value to the industry,"" said Severance. ""I'm looking forward to leveraging Blackboard's new focus and investment in open source to bring new value to institutions using Sakai.""

"Dan Rooney: It's Not About the Money
By Shawn Brown
The 700 Club
The Pittsburgh Steelers are one of the NFL’s most championed franchises. It’s the team that’s won five Super Bowl Championships and produced Hall of Famers, like “mean” Joe Green, Terry Bradshaw, Franco Harris, Lynn Swann and Jack Lambert. There are few who can talk about the team and its history other than owner, Dan Rooney. Recently The 700 Club sports reporter, Shawn Brown, sat down with Rooney.
Interview with Dan Rooney:
Dan Rooney: Steelers' football is something that we really go all out. Our number one thing is to win. We want to do it right. We don’t want to cheat or anything like that. We want to do the right way and measure up.
In his book, My 75 years with the Pittsburgh Steelers and the NFL, Dan recalls the history of the team, as well as the challenges and the NFL had to overcome in order to survive.
Shawn Brown: Here [stadium] is where the season begins for the Pittsburgh Steelers. And it’s been that way for the last 42 years. But the legacy of the Steelers began over 75 years ago, on the north side of Pittsburgh, with a man and his five sons.
Art Rooney, Dan’s father, realized the opportunity bringing professional football to Pittsburgh. So, in 1933, he paid $2500 for a National Football League franchise. He named the team the Pittsburgh Pirates, like the long established baseball team. The name didn’t quite fit. So, in 1940 they became the Pittsburgh Steelers. And Dan was there for as long as he can remember.
Dan: I knew as I got older than lets say 5,6,7 - I knew my father had the football team. We always had the equipment downstairs in the basement in the off season. I was very much involved and knew what was happening.
Though there were five sons, Dan and his younger brother, Art Jr., worked closely with their father, and he says he’s learned some valuable lessons about faith and leadership.
Dan: My father was really a people person. He always talked to me about, ‘don’t ever think you’re too big or to good for people. Everybody is important regardless of race, religion, or anything else.’ His faith meant everything to him. And he practiced, and he expected us to practice our faith. I remember they had Sunday school. So my father would say, ‘You’ve got to go to Sunday school.’ So, he always made sure we practiced our faith.
Shawn: Do you turn to God for guidance with franchise draft decisions?
Dan: Sure. Yeah, I mean, I pray each morning and go to mass and talk and say, ‘let the Holy Spirit guide us and make the right selections,’ and things like that. So I definitely call upon God to assist us and make the right selections.
Dan became franchise president in 1955. Up until then, the Steelers hadn’t played a post season game in years. But 1969 brought a new era in Steelers’ history. They hired head coach Chuck Noll to turn the struggling team around. Three years later, they made it to the 1972 playoffs against the Oakland Raiders. With just 22 seconds left in the game, they trailed 7-6. The next play would go down as one of the most memorable moments in NFL history.
Dan: The “Immaculate Reception”. That was it. There’s no question. That was it. That was probably the best play in the history of the league.
With time running out, Terry Bradshaw through a pass that was deflected by an Oakland defender. Out of nowhere, Steelers running back Franco Harris caught the ball inches from the ground, and ran it in to win the game.
Dan: He just took the ball right up the field. And then we went on - won our division for the first time.
The next season, the Steelers went on to win two consecutive Super Bowls. And Dan says it was great winning them with his dad.
Dan: That’s a great thing, to be there with him for the first one especially. Everybody with the exception of Minnesota was for him.
Art “the chief” Rooney, passed away in 1988. But Dan’s continued his legacy of leadership. In 1992, Chuck Noll retired and Dan found one of Pittsburgh’s own, head coach Bill Cower, who before retiring in 2007, led the Steelers to their fifth Super Bowl Championship. But Dan’s reflection of his father is not just felt with his team, but through out the league as well. One example of that is his suggestion of the “Rooney rule,” which requires all NFL teams to interview at least one minority for a head coaching position.
Shawn: Why was it important for you to implement the Rooney Rule?
Dan: Well, let’s say - whether it was called the Rooney Rule or not - the thing that it was, was to give everybody a chance; and to recognize that there are black men that can be as good a coach as anyone else. That’s the thing, to give them a chance. So, we said if you’re going to hire a coach, you must interview at least one minority. And that opened the door for everybody.
Everybody including Tony Dungy, Lovie Smith, and Steelers’ current head coach, Mike Tomlin, to name a few. According to “Mr. Rooney,” the future of the Steelers and the NFL looks bright, but there’s a few things he wants to make sure those around him understand.
Dan: Money means nothing. I never made any decision based on money. Values, integrity, character, and all of those things - I think are important.

"the 'Nozarks' trail
Hikers, bikers and horseback riders
in north Missouri
| Doug Long rides a section of trail in Crowder State Park near
Trenton. Long is the catalyst behind the Green Hills Trail Association
and a hard-core mountain bike racer.
There are two common
misconceptions about north Missouri. The first is that it’s flat.
The second is that there are no rocks. Those misconceptions are quickly
swept away for anyone who has ever attempted to follow Doug Long on
a trail at Crowder State Park.
Doug, best known
to Chillicothe residents as the former Hornet wrestling coach and middle
school assistant principal, is a terror on a mountain bike. “I
have a bad gene,” he readily admits after guiding his battered mountain
bike up and down miles of trails, oblivious to the steep, gnarly terrain.
bad gene has kept Doug at the helm of a small but dedicated group of volunteers
called the Green Hills Trail Association. The group is slowly turning north
Missouri into a destination for mountain bikers, trail runners, equestrians
and hikers who previously thought south was the only way to go.
In fact, Doug
coined a term for the Green Hills Region: “The Nozarks.” These
pockets of steep, heavily forested hillsides are more Ozark hills and hollers
than north Missouri farmland.
It was Tim Riekena,
a member of the group and a teacher at Chillicothe Middle School, who
really started the effort to put north Missouri’s trails on
the map. An avid outdoorsman, he wrote a series of trail columns for
the Chillicothe Constitution-Tribune, focusing on a radius 20 to 30
miles around Chillicothe.
“I was trying
to find what was close, places where I could ride and hike,” he
says. “In most books, 80 percent of what they covered was south
of the Missouri River in the Ozarks. While the Ozarks are beautiful,
they are just too far away.”

Tim Riekena and Mark Jenkins.
In time, readers
started encouraging Tim to write a book. He expanded his coverage to
anywhere north of the Missouri River and was amazed at what he found.
Little-known trails crisscross the northern half of Missouri in state
parks, city parks, Corps of Engineers land and remote Conservation
Department wildlife areas.
Tim devoted his summer
vacations to documenting the north-Missouri trails. Eventually, he
featured 84 trails in a book called “North Missouri Mountain
Biking, Hiking and GPS Trail Guide.”
“I went to
print discovering more trails,” he says. “It was
definitely a grassroots effort to get north Missouri in front

way to the new Jones Confluence State Park, where the Missouri and
Mississippi rivers meet. It includes waypoints that owners of GPS units
can use to take them directly to trailheads and attractions like waterfalls.
hard-core mountain bikers like Long were interested in improving
the selection of trails closer to home. Crowder State Park, dubbed “the
gem of north Missouri” in Riekena’s book, already had
a nice network of trails. But these trails were built years ago and
were not designed for mountain bikes. They needed work to prevent

build trails right, all groups will be able to use them,” says
That was the goal
when Long approached Terry Truttmann, resource forester for the Missouri
Department of Conservation, about the possibility of building a new
trail at the southern half of Poosey Conservation Area west of Chillicothe.
The northern part of the area already had 20 miles of multi-use trails
used by horseback riders.

“He was way
ahead of the curve,” Long
says of the land-use manager. “He
recognized the need for separate trails to avoid conflicts
(between horses and bikers).” Eventually, Long and the fledgling
Green Hills Trail Association members carved a mile of trail into
the woods around Indian Lake, opening the area to hikers and bikers
but also hunters and anglers.
The trail group also
found a kindred spirit in Paul Anders, manager of Crowder State Park.
maintenance efforts take a burden off park personnel.
his first trail-building efforts at Crowder and Poosey left much
to be desired.
He says, “What you tend to do, you see a deer path. That’s
easy, it’s already there. Now I’ve raced and ridden trails
all over the United States. I’ve had the opportunity to observe
and see well-built trails and I’ve seen poor-built trails. Every
mistake you can make, I’ve
made that mistake.”

Once the group proved
it would maintain the trail, Truttmann let them
add more miles. Long put his growing trail-building
skills to work and designed sections of trail
that can be easily maintained and would appeal to a
broad range of runners, hikers and bikers.
Today the trail, called the Green Hills Trail
or Indian Creek Lake Trail, is gaining fame,
especially with mountain bikers. Comments on
mountain bike Web sites show the trail is bringing
cyclists from as far away as Joplin to test their
mettle on the challenging terrain. Riders from
Nebraska and Iowa have also discovered the trail,

are bringing both road riders and mountain bikers to the area. In
the spring, the group’s “Crank and Cruise” event caters
to the off-road crowd. In the fall,
the Green Hills Tour takes cyclists from Crowder to Jamesport to Poosey and
back to Crowder on gravel roads.
These events — along
with constant prodding by Long — have brought
fresh blood into the group. “I’d
like to see us get more volunteers,” Long
says. “What I’m trying

But you're right about everything else, though. People would rather watch non-live events on their own time, and those who can't afford a monthly subscription to HBO, Showtime, Cinemax, or Starz but want to watch their individual programs will gladly pony up the cash to watch shows like Dexter, True Blood, or Game of Thrones on Netflix, iTunes or Amazon.

"Congratulations, you hot-shot mobile app developer, you. This Sumo owes you some big fat props, ‘cause you FINALLY finished developing your awesome new mobile app and released it on the marketplace for the world to behold.
After months of sweat and late-night taco runs, you’ve pushed through the final approval and offered up your spit-shined code baby for the masses to buy and download. Your job’s done—now you kick back, start raking in the bucks, and join the ranks of Angry Birds and Fruit Ninja, right?
This ain’t a “set it and forget it” kind of business, Sumo-ling. Now’s the part where you have to pay attention to how your app’s doing on the market, and what people think of it.
And that takes you paying constant attention to who’s buying it, where they live, where they’re downloading it from, what kind of mobile device they’re using it on, and basically measuring a bunch of other data points and sales reports to know how your baby’s doing. Downloading mountains of CSV files to look over customer transactions. Sifting through reviews across multiple app marketplaces to see what people like and hate. Important stuff, but it takes sooo much time.
But you already know that, right? It’s a sad truth that you’ve come to live with—it comes with the territory. But your rookie mobile developer buddy doesn’t know that. He just knows he’s a sick coder and wants to build an app. But he’ll probably keep putting it off, ‘cause he’s heard horror stories about the endless heaps of monitoring and measuring that come after launch day. He doesn’t know what all it entails, just that it’s gonna suck.
Well I’ve got news for you AND your scared little rookie friend—managing your mobile app’s analytics doesn’t have to suck. In fact, it can be pretty freakin’ easy.
The secret? Mopapp—an online platform that makes it easy to track and analyze all of your mobile apps’ sales and activity, spitting out easy-to-use reports that let you better know your customers.
Thing is, there are a LOT of mobile analytics services. Some are geared toward tracking iOS apps in the App Store, some are great for apps in the Android Market. But they fall short, ‘cause they can’t track and analyze apps sold in many different app stores, target toward many different devices. Good news is, Mopapp can.
Mopapp is a single analytics platform that works with most major stores, like:
● Android Market
● Windows Phone Marketplace
● RIM App World
And most major platforms, like:
● iPhone & iPad
● Windows Phone 7
It’s a versatile service you can use to simultaneously track dozens—even hundreds—of apps, pulling everything together into a clean central dashboard that lets you easily compare which platforms and app stores are really working for you.
Here’s a taste of just some of what this powerful tool can do:
Quick, flexible setup
Mopapp plays well with others. Just pick an app store out of that list of usual suspects, tell Mopapp which app you want to track, and it’ll immediately start pulling raw sales data into your dashboard for your slicing and dicing. Everything imports at least once daily, so you’ll always have an up-to-date read on how your apps are doing. Have your own e-commerce setup you want to use to sell your app on your own site? No problem—it comes with an API and manual CSV import to get you started.
Everything in one place
Quit slogging through sales spreadsheets from a bunch of different stores to get reports on your apps. Simply pick your most important outcomes—recent sales, revenue, profits—and see it all together on one page. At a glance, you’ll see which of your apps are doing well, in which countries, on which platforms, and in which stores. It’s got an arsenal of stock reports to show you, like sales by country or device. And if that’s not your thing, you can set up your own custom reports to show you only what matters to you.
Your bottom line, without the runaround
Mopapp doesn’t care that you suck at math. In fact, it’s glad you do, ‘cause it’s really, really good at math. It actually subtracts the commissions of each store and shows you your net profit, saving you the hassle of reading up on store rules and policies, or worse, building custom spreadsheets to calculate it yourself. As a bonus, Mopapp converts everything to a single currency of your choice, meaning no pesky conversions.
Easy ad reports
So you’re one of those nice fellas who offers your app for free and makes a little money from the banner ads? Good news—Mopapp integrates with AdMob, InMobi, Apple’s iAd, and is coming soon to a lot of other ad networks. That means you can automatically display your ad reports alongside your downloads, revenue, and profits, letting you see all of your moneymaking streams at once.
You wanna know what people are actually saying about your app, which is great, ‘cause Mopapp’s not just about downloads and sales. It aggregates customer reviews from all over the web in a single place—even translates them to a single language—so you can quickly scroll through and see what folks think. But it doesn’t stop there. While you’re off takin’ a nap, it’s crunching these reviews, ratings, and other customer data into a special Mopapp Sentiment Index score that quickly tells you whether your customer reviews are helping or hurting your app’s sales.
Bottom line, Sumo-ling, this thing is crazy-powerful. It makes that thing you’re dreading—the analytics, the measuring, the reporting, the analyzing, the interpreting—a snap. What you’re left with is good, solid data that you can work with. That you can use to better target your app. That you can use to make more money from all the hard work you’ve already put in.
The best part is, this fat Sumo’s been working hard, too. I had to call in some shady, back-alley-type favors to get this one, but I think you’ll like it. ‘Cause for a short time, you can get 1 full year of the Mopapp Professional Plan, in all its mobile-app-analytics-powerhouse-glory, for…
That’s right, Sumo-ling—1 Year of Mopapp Professional for $49.
Give yourself a break—you’ve earned it. You owe it to yourself to make this part of your app biz as easy as it can be. But you gotta be quick, this one won’t last.
The Chief Sumo
P.S. Mopapp also works with 3rd-party in-app analytics, so if you’re already using Flurry or Google Analytics, you can now see their data alongside the rest.

""This new facility has been designed to allow for easier renovations and new configurations to foster more scientific collaboration amongst NCI staff.""
""We are pleased to announce that the buildings are LEED Gold (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certified which means that NCI employees will be working in some of the most environmentally-friendly workspaces in the Washington metropolitan area,"" explained Paunil. ""For example, the building features a green roof, outdoor green space and a daylight harvesting system that allows NCI to maximize the usage of natural light and reduce energy costs.""
NCI Shady Grove is conveniently accessible from several exits off Interstate 270 and is located about six miles north of the Executive Plaza location. In addition, NCI Shady Grove has Metrobus and Ride-On stops near the buildings. The nearby Shady Grove Metrorail station will be serviced by Ride-On bus. Shuttle service will also be available from NCI Shady Grove to the NIH campus in Bethesda.
The General Services Administration (GSA) determined the new NCI Shady Grove location in close consultation with NIH and NCI. The selections were based on a rigorous, year-long competitive bidding process conducted by GSA.",en,reference

"(Video & Audio) Here is one of Obama's greatest gaffs... trying to impose his ""class warfare"" tactics on a subject he commands! On my FaceBook, a young detractor wrote this (Posted by Religio-Political Talk):
Okay, several things. Obama didn't make some heated overly assaulting attack on Meh Romney as you might think coming from the GOP's reaction to this. Yes it was directed at Mitt and yeah, Obama stretched the truth on his upbringing, but no one cares, or at least no one should. The fact politicians do these things really isn't news and I can think of plenty of other issues that should be discussed instead of this. OK so what, this makes Obama look a bit silly, but whats more ridiculous is how much this is being blown up by FOX and how Medved seems so outraged about it all. The best part was when Romney was talking to Steve Doocy about what Obama said. It was all fair and fine until he started making comments towards Obama. ""This is a time for us to solve problems, this is not a time to be attacking people."" Its so hypocritical its comical. I'm Happy for Romney and his success as a first gen college grad, but the whole outrage over this is dumb.
You are right, sorta, when you said ""no one cares."" Just the lemmings do not care (http://youtu.be/woBC5b3Ti0M).
Thinking people however, know the class-warfare rhetoric that the Left
espouses is dangerous to truth, or as you say, ""stretched the truth.""
This ""I feel good"" policy of the left (class-warfare, affirmative
action, diversity, etc) placing ""equality"" as their highest standard,
instead of liberty, is why Obama can ""stretch the truth"" as he does in
order to promote ""fairness."" One of my favorite quotes is this, and it
sets up the next audio/video well:
""Of all tyrannies, a tyranny exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. It may be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies. The robber baron’s cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated; but those who torment us for our own good will torment us without end for they do so with the approval of their own conscience."" ~ CS Lewis Or, as Reagan quipped: ""The nine most terrifying words in the English language are: 'I'm from the government and I'm here to help.'""
So many may not care about the hyperbole or stretching of the truth from Obama (his time in a racist church, his grandfathers WWII history, his mothers fight with insurance companies, his covering up time in college, whatever) to make policy sound good, but I prefer people who do care about the big issues (like mentioned below) to the small... they all paint a picture of why we must reject the ""feel good"" politics of the left: http://www.mrctv.org/videos/affirming-feelings-not-truth",en,web

Sheriffs to SCAN License Plates at Pala, Rincon, San Pasqual casinos. If you are concerned about privacy rights, STAY AWAY!
Sheriff's officials said the vehicle will be used in North County casinos, such as Pala Casino and Valley View Casino, which have multiple-level parking lots. Deputies will be looking in particular for stolen vehicles.
Can you say: VEGAS BABY!
The Valley Center substation serves the communities of Valley Center, Pauma Valley, Palomar Mountain and Rancho Guejito. It also serves several reservations, such as La Jolla, Pala, Rincon and San Pasqual. The money for the vehicle came from the Barona Band of Mission Indians and the Sycuan Band of Mission Indians through the Indian Gaming Local Community Benefit Committee.
The committee was formed to distribute grants aimed at reducing the off-reservation problems caused by tribal gaming, such as crime, traffic and gambling addiction.",en,web

"More lessons for leaders
Mort Meyerson's cover story in the April:May issue of Fast Company prompted hundreds of e-mail messages.
We've published some of the following in the magazine, but were so overrun by interesting bits of information and intriguing opinions that we've decided to post the conversation here, where space is infinite. The correspondence illuminates the conversational pow-wows happening in the bustling halls of corporations around the world. We wanted to share with you what people are saying about leadership. Reply, consider, argue, or ignore the conversation that's happening. If you haven't read ""Everything I thought I knew About Leadership is Wrong"" , click here to be informed, and then join the conversation:

My partner found your article in Fast Company and left it for me with a note that read, ""There is someone else out there who's discovered what we already know."" I found it to be one of the most reassuring articles on management I've read in a long time.
Back in 1980 my partner and I formed an ad agency based on the belief that we could not only produce great work and make our clients successful, but that we could also treat the people who worked for us like real, living, breathing human beings. That's tough in this crazy, demanding industry.
We developed our values based on the belief that stretching and supporting each other was a good thing, that people want positive reinforcement, that people want leadership to clear the way so they can be successful, not the other way around.
It's like being on a roller coaster. Some people will get scared and want to get off. Some people will be exhilarated and can't get enough. But the ride is always interesting. And the result is we have grown a group of people who will do just about anything for our company and customers.
Thanks for your words of encouragement and your story.

Your message was inspiring to me since you seem to have found what we ourselves found, but in a different (or maybe not so different) business. It will be interesting to see where both of our companies are 50 years from now. Thanks for writing. It's a boost to know other people are struggling with similar challenges.
I recently left Arthur Andersen for a career in the music industry. I am now a financial analyst at a record distributor, and many of the issues you raised about the ""pre-revolution"" Perot Systems are in place at our company. Andersen is a lot closer to the ""post-revolution"" Perot Systems, so I've had a chance to taste both.
Because of your article, I told my boss (via e-mail) that I wanted to start a revolution at our company. I was hoping you could e-mail me with a few words of wisdom, or just a plain ""go-for-it"" message before we put on our rally caps and tackle this organization.
- Skip Sterne

Go for it! The try is fun, scary, and mind-expanding.
I enjoyed your article, especially the proposition that this is ""the path we'll be on for the rest of our lives. It has no destination.""
Many of the things you write about are in full swing at our company. My question is: What kind of compensation system did you enact at Perot Systems?
Our company is pushing very hard for the type of ""performance-based"" compensation system you suggested was in place at EDS. I think the consequences here will be the same as they were there. Any suggestions?
- Reagan Rorschach
Pay-for-performance is a mantra that sounds great for the uninitiated. You can talk about being things other than a corporate warrior, but if pay is for making the bottom line only, you get the results you ask for.
We are installing variable pay with bonuses based on how the company, the unit, and the individual did on profits, revenues, and customer satisfaction. We also enter items like support of other people and team participation. There is no ""formula"" that I know about that can capture these factors. I am not suggesting ""nonprofit"" thinking or ""feel-good"" thinking. The shareholders win if we do this right. I know that businesses exist to survive and that survival requires profits. But we will try to be indirect rather than direct and see what happens. E-mail me at the end of this year and I will tell you what has happened with our experiment.
I am completing my MBA, and when I look at the jobs my friends go to, I feel sad and angry. Why do so many companies use and waste people like they do?
I don't want to climb the hierarchy at some company, work my ass off, and do things that don't make me happy. What are your thoughts about getting into companies and actually convincing them to change?
- Anders Karlsson
Stockholm School of Economics
The idea of going to a company to change it is like marrying someone with the thought that you'll change that person. Your parents will confirm that it is a losing strategy. Figure out what you want to do, where, and with whom. Then go find that company and get in.
That was a courageous and apt article for many in Silicon Valley to heed these days. Thanks for sharing such personal feelings with us; it will pay dividends to our industry.
I was struck by your message about how the reward structure sets the tone for every level of the company. It's in keeping with how Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard tried to build Hewlett-Packard, and it works! I left HP in 1991 after nearly 30 years there.
I spent many hours with Bill in particular, discussing how the measurement and reward systems determine people's actions. We made a huge investment in downplaying the individual and up-playing the team, and it showed in commission structures for the sales force, individual stock-option awards - everything worked in concert.
- Chuck House
Santa Barbara, California
Thanks for your message. With respect to HP, are you saying that team-sharing set up the right motives or that pay-for-performance hurt the company?
I meant the former. An example that Bill Hewlett liked to use concerned the HP calculator. It went something like this:
If you ask your research team to stretch, rather than go for safe goals, then you should expect that only about 40% of their projects will succeed.
If you ask your development teams to stretch, they'll look for ideas from lots of places other than the research labs, which means they may take on only 40% of the ""successful"" ideas from research. Which means only 16% (.40 x .40) of your research projects are ""successful"" in the sense that they get ""productized.""
Now, if you create a system that pays big rewards for ""successful"" projects, the net result will be to cut down on the stretch goals set by your research and development staffs. That's why we rewarded the entire research group when a new HP calculator came from the group, and not just the few people on the specific team that created it.
- Chuck House
You do a great job explaining the old context that developed under your stewardship at EDS. You also provide some good ideas for changing the direction of the organization because, as you say, people changed, the market changed, technology changed. But the most interesting question is: What in you changed?
Why did what you saw when you returned strike you as wrong, when it was once acceptable? Was it the result of a seminar you participated in, or books you read? You are dead-on about the ""fundamental revolution"" taking place in the business world, which is why I'd like to find the key to the change in your attitude.
- Phil McCole
from Mort Meyerson: I didn't read a book. I spent time in the personal-computer industry with Michael Dell as his personal coach. I got older. I worked on the side of the customer, not EDS, on several consulting gigs. I had time to reflect.
I want to clarify one thing. I did not argue that EDS changed after I left. It was that way when I was there. I just didn't hear or see it.
from Brudus Meyerson: I am Mort Meyerson's dad. May I take the liberty of stating my observations on Mort's ""transformation""?
Our only child, Mort, was always bright and courageous. But it took him a while to learn that fame and fortune, business acumen, and general success in the workaday world, do not guarantee peace and happiness.
During his so-called leisure time after he was out of EDS, he began to investigate why he wasn't content. A world of money and material accumulation. Acclaim and fame. But still not there.
So he started examining philosophy, kindness, love, empathy, sympathy, and many other spiritual qualities, and simply got on track for the ""real"" things.
When he got back into the business arena with Perot Systems, he saw that there is a place for these qualities in all things, including hard-ball business.
I work for EDS. I've been here just over 10 years so I never had the opportunity to formally meet you. I found your article in Fast Company to be one of the single most impressive articles on leadership I have read in years. It was obvious that the thoughts were backed by experience, internal soul searching, and from your heart. I wish I could have had the opportunity to have known you. As I know you have an interest in Japan, I thought I'd send you one of my favourite quotes:
""We are going to win and the industrial west is going to lose out: there is nothing much you can do about it, because the reasons for your failure are within yourselves. Your firms are built on the Taylor Model; even worse, so are your heads. With your bosses doing the thinking while the workers wield the screwdrivers, you're convinced deep down that this is the correct way to run a business. For you, the essence of leadership is getting the ideas out of the heads of the bosses and into the hands of the labor.
""We are beyond the Taylor Model; business, we know, is now so complex and difficult, the survival of firms so hazardous in an environment increasingly unpredictable, competitive, and fraught with danger, that their continued existence depends on the day-to-day mobilization of every ounce of intelligence. For us, the essence of effective leadership is precisely the art of mobilizing and pulling together the intellectual resources of all employees in the service of the firm. Only by drawing on the combined brainpower of all its employees can

Robb R. Rasmussen
Tell your wife that I loved her translation.
I appreciate your comments and observations. I was concerned that EDSers would read my article as a blast at them or the company. It was meant to show that I was the problem (along with others) - not the heart or soul of the company. I was so sure I was right and doing the right thing that I didn't have time to think that I might not get it.
I read the article on leadership that you wrote for Fast Company...it was good stuff. I have been working for EDS for a year and a half and I totally love my job. I think EDS is a great company to work for .
I am a team leader at Direct Support. The people I work with are the highest quality group of people I have ever worked with: driven, professional, and competent men and women with character, vision and reliable personal values. This is the first job I have had in my 29 years where a day when I do not have fun is the exception.
I just wanted to let you know that I appreciate the values that you helped build into the company. I also appreciated the fact that even after all the leadership experience you have had, there are still lessons to learn and even complete shifts in philosophy to undergo.
The leadership philosophy at EDS has transformed my view of people so that I now attempt to find out how I can intrinsically motivate my people instead of extrinsically motivating them. I think the ideas of freedom to take initiative, true empowerment (as opposed to politically-correct, fluffball empowerment) and the opportunity to risk are some of the most powerful drivers of intrinsic motivation.
Thanks also for being both honest and complimentary about EDS. The temptation would have been to bash us because we are a competitor. It meant a lot to me that you honored EDS and this simply enhanced your credibility.
I hope that you continue to share the refinements of your leadership philosophy. I truly gained a lot of insight from your article.
I very much appreciate your message. I have gotten a few flames from EDSers thinking I was knocking the current EDS. You saw that I was not taking on EDS but myself. I love EDS and the people there. It is a great company that has endured and succeeded over a long period of time. That is the true test of greatness. I also think EDS has a soul that most companies would kill for.
I enjoyed reading your article in Fast Company regarding your personal leadership transformation. I realize your article stated that ""everyone in Perot Systems knows they can E-Mail me and I'll read it - me, not my secretary."" As an EDS employee I sincerely hope you will take a moment to read and reply to this note. I'll be brief.
I feel your intention was to describe your personal transformation and the values of Perot Systems. However, your references to EDS were at best outdated and at worst gross disinformation. I do realize that your basis for these assessments was EDS circa 1986, but I assure you EDS has made a dramatic transformation. Les Alberthal and the current leadership have been leaders in the sense you describe. We have become centered by our values.We respect our customers and don't try to win every negotiation. We do not honor ""death marches""; rather we work to improve performance by improving processes. Rewards are based on performance, contributions, and market value. Our leaders don't know all the answers but serve the customer, the people, and our company. It's definitely not easy and without tension or hard work, but I feel more balanced than I did when I worked for another company starting in 1985. That company was EDS, but it wasn't the same!!
I find it hard to believe you don't know more about EDS - or was this just another example of ""negative campaigning"" designed to undermine a competitor in the minds of potential customers and employees of our companies? I sincerely hope not as I choose to believe you are a leader with integrity. I respect the EDS you helped to create and I am glad that Perot Systems and EDS have both found lessons to be learned about how to be great companies.
I hope you will reread your message and think about it again. I have many friends at EDS and the article I wrote said nothing about EDS now or said anything negative about the company, it's current leadership, it's current style or intentions. It simply said that I had great success by standard measures and that I realized after I left that I had made many mistakes. That says nothing about Les and what is going on now.
Further, your comment about negative campaigning is a slam with a withdrawal that you couldn't believe I would do that. I have never said negative things about tyhe leade4s of EDS or the company. If you can find any reference otherwise I would be happy to clarify the situation.
I have not had any customers, prospects or anyone in the marketplace make any comments about the ""bad EDS"" or the ""reinvented PSC"". To read that into the article could be coming from inside your head and not from my article.
Lastly, your description of EDS is slightly rosy. I know many people there and I would find it hard to believe that things are like what you describe. I worked on projects too long and with customers too long to believe the change is that immense in such a short time. We aren't at PSC, but we are trying just like EDS.
Finally, I know that the leadership of PSC is smart, tough and trying very hard. I respect almost everyone of them as humans and businesspeople. Your message materially changes the tone that was intended and read by most people. I am sorry for that and hope that my comments help bring some light to the situation.
Thank you for your response, Mort. Isn't this a great thing about our culture and the wide-spread availability of technology that we can exchange ideas and concerns with anyone, anywhere, anytime? I really appreciate the thoughtfulness you have shown by responding to my impressions.
You're right that I read your article from my perspective. EDS has been very successful in large part due to the standard business measures you mention in your reply that drove the leaders and the employees to meet short term financial goals. I still think your message in the article was that PSC has adopted additional measures as described by the values and principles of the company. These are very appropriate measures and should be praised in their own right.
To compare PSC today to EDS of many years ago and say ""everything you thought you knew"" from this experience is ""wrong"" sets a tone that EDS is still the way it was. You are very right that it doesn't say EDS is bad. You are right that this is how I read it. Several people I work with read it the same way I did, but that is neither here nor there.
My point in writing you was to say that EDS has learned the lessons you have learned. Your descriptions were of an EDS culture that existed in large part in the past. My ""rosy"" description is probably as rosy as your feelings toward PSC. Somewhere in between both are probably more acceptable to most people.
If I offended you in my brief statements I apologize. That was not my intention.
You did not offend me since you were earnest in your positions. That is what dialogue is about. I have not met any person outside of EDS that has read this as a blast at EDS or a comparison of EDS of old and PSC of new to the detriment of EDS. In fact, most people feel that I was too hard on myself about the EDS of old. Nonetheless I took great pride in being at EDS and being part of the team that trained the now very successful team there. I know that things are different now. Two of the top 4 officers of EDS emailed me that they appreciated my views and agreed that both our companies are miles down the road from the old days. They didn't have heartburn since they didn't need to say anything. On the other hand they have known me intimately for decades and you and other younger EDSers don't.
Now all this aside. EDS is great compared to the rifraf out there in the market and I think PSC is too. I did not say and don't think that things are that rosy at PSC. I do think we are trying hard. Same is true for EDS.
A friend of mine just showed me the article you wrote in Fast Company magazine. I definitely agreed with what you had to say about the need for a new direction in managing people in American corporate culture, and a new view of what leadership means.
However, you made some very provocative statements early in the article, and I was hoping you would back them up. You talked about how organizations must change radically because a fundamental revolution in business is imminent, and further:
""Many companies that have enjoyed decades of fabulous success will find themselves out of business in the next five years if they don't make revolutionary changes.""
It's not that I disagree. In fact I believe that the trend towards short term profitability has increased from ""what have you done for me this quarter"" to ""what have you done for me in the last two weeks,"" and will take a number of companies into a downward spiral impossible to pull out of. Look what happened to Apple Computer earlier this year. Then there is the increasingly negative work environment where corporations have no regard for their members. Although, from what I have seen, people usually have an unrequited loyalty to the company. I would expect this combination to come back and bite - no, devour - many organizations.
What led you to make your five-year statement? What's happening in your field of view that would cause this, what aspects of the environment? Also I would like to hear your thoughts on how these things will happen, that is, both sides of ""change or die"". What will trigger the change, and for those who cannot or will not, what will bring about their demise? Hope you can find time to respond.
I watched the GM company come unraveled up close and inside. I watched IBM come unraveled from afar. I see the Post Office losing the only profitable business they have and not adjusting. I see businesses in Europe stuck in the paradigm of what is normal for their culture. Their country laws and social programs make them technologically inept. I see India and China coming hard.
Five years is a guess. It means not now and not in the distant future. I am betting our company's future that we should talk and deal with these issues.
I was inspired by your article. Thank you for the insight, and for sharing it with the rest of us. If it's any consolation, it's no easier for the next generation. I was born the year you started the health care practice, recently graduated from Harvard Business School (where many of your observations were drilled into my consciousness), and still struggle with many of the issues you articulated in your piece.
The message: Culture endures. It's the only truly sustainable competitive advantage in business, and though it never reaches the analysts, it is the most important job of the CEO.
Back to work...

Thanks for your thoughtful note. The mission of a CEO is interesting. In the final analysis it is your job to make sure others can succeed in what they do. That is a hard transition for many operating type people like myself.
Your article in Fast Company touched me like few others have. Your new mission for the life and health of Perot Systems mirrors my own when I am in leadership positions, but I didn't think I would see it expressed so clearly.
My MBA from Wharton didn't teach it to me. My years of marketing and selling large east coast investment real estate only hinted at it, especially when I felt the system wasn't working. But my years of working in the arts(producing, directing, and marketing theatre), where people are a bit more open with their emotions and desires, helped to shape my thinking.
Thank you for putting into words what I trust a number of us have been thinking about for quite some time. I will be passing around this article (and this great new magazine) to help others see the light.
Charles Seymour, Jr.
Thanks for your note. I am glad it felt familiar to you. I think quite a few people have gone down this path before. The response to the article has exceeded my expectations. I guess email makes it so easy to communicate that people will do so more readily.
I am the marketing part of the management staff of a small instrumentation company, and we are wrestling with the same issues - on a smaller scale. The downsizing and the bone-cutting that many large corporations are conducting has convinced me that unless we, as a startup, concentrate on producing long-term value for our shareholders and our stakeholders, we will ultimately produce a profit-machine which consumes our human resources just the way we consume our physical raw material resources. Maybe we all missed the point when we changed ""personnel"" (pertaining to persons) to ""human resources"" (just another resource, like electricity, or typewriters). I am not sure I learned a lot from your article, but it sure confirmed what I've been thinking about. I also wonder sometimes if I am a highly-specialized beast who may not make it through this evolutionary shift.
I know where I want to go... I just haven't got a clue how to get there.
Your message was quite interesting to me. Since Jim Cannavino came to our company I have felt less like a specialized beast and more grounded. I guess everyone needs company. If you don't know where you are going any road will take you there, But if you have self doubts, in the main that is healthy. Only nuts, mentally unbalanced and self-possessed people don't have self doubts.
As a former EDSer, I was wondering if your article would contain the same old tired rhetoric about ""re-engineering the company"" and ""employee empowerment"". I was actually impressed - I think you did a good job!
You see, I consider myself the original iconoclast. I heartily subscribe to David Kelley's thought that when everyone's got to follow the rules, creativity gets stifled, and I firmly believe that the corporate culture of America (you have to wear a suit and tie to work, your job is fixed in concrete, there is such a thing as a ""boss"" who you work for and who tells you what to do) is what's killing American competiveness around the world. In fact, I can't believe I wore a suit and tie to work for 3 years.
However, I was concerned that you mentioned, over and over again, that ""we met with senior leaders"" and that ""people were rewarded."" Apparently the ""senior leaders"" were the ones getting all the financial rewards. What happened to the guy at the bottom getting rich, too? What happens to the guys out on the loading dock? Are they listened to? Has anyone ever considered that the guys at the ""bottom"" perhaps know more about what's going on than the guys at the top? Has anyone ever asked the guy who delivers the interoffice mail what he thinks about where the company is going and what he'd do if he were at the top? A little later on in Fast Company there was an article about Whole Foods, where the team is everything, salaries are posted, etc.
Maybe that's what we need more of in the industry instead of companies paying lip service to the idea of ""employee empowerment"".
The thing that bothers me most about corporate America is that while the few ""rich fatcats"" at the top are making the decisions for the thousands of people who work at the company, when a bad decision is made, the guys at the top still get their bonuses and stock options, while the folks at the bottom of the ladder are the ones who lose their jobs. It's also amazing to me that in most companies, the guys at the top know almost nothing about what's going on at the bottom, nor do they particularly care.
I wish you luck with Perot Systems, but if you are trying to re-engineer, to make PS a better place to work for everyone, not just a few, it may be more of an uphill battle.
The problem with my article is that it is not clear. Every person in PSC owns PSC stock while we are private. That means everyone who has been here long enough to belong to the 401K at every level - secretaries, security, everyone. We have a much narrower band of pay from top to bottom than any company I know of our size. Thus, I must have given you the wrong message. Whole foods is a great company. But they are not doing anything that we aren't doing.
I just retired from the Navy and had a very similar experience. I was Captain of a Navy guided missile frigate and was imbued with the normal Navy ""need"" to run a perfect ship, win all the awards, and be in complete control. When I walked on board, I saw the faces of the sailors I was to command and instantly dropped my old goals for two new ones: to make certain every sailor left the ship with the same number of fingers and toes that he arrived with (ie. safety was number one), and to do whatever was necessary to make every man a success within his own frame of reference. I became confident that if the sailors felt they were a success, they would make certain that my ship was a success.
Bottom line: your new view of leadership is on the mark.
I very much appreciate your note. Several people have written me from the Navy - either civilian or military people. That is interesting since I was Army and not one Army type has written.
I was very impressed by your article in Fast Company. In a prior issue of Fast Company, the CEO of Verifone expressed the same view as yours regarding e-mail. Obviously, many of your views on leadership and values evolved through your many experiences. I was wondering if any books, papers, people or philosophies (written or otherwise) had any major effect on your views. If so, would you mind telling me what they were?
I know how busy you are and I appreciate your time. Once again, a fantastic article and I hope you write more in the future.
Director International Sales
The books I have read that influenced me are history books on the Mongolians in the 12-15th century, Japan from birth to the 18th century, and China and Korea until the 20th century. I also added a dollop of the history of India. I am not that widely read, but these books have influenced my thinking along with a smattering of writings by the ancient Sages/Prophets/Rabbi's of my religion. I have not read any contemporary management books because I don't find them interesting. I tried several and only Peter Drucker made much sense to me.
The process we used was helped along by Richard Pascale. You can look him up as he has written several books that made some sense to me.
I read about your transformation in Fast Company magazine and shared your article with the Regional Director of a large international child development organization. I am an organizational consultant, and I used the article in one of our coaching sessions. He asked me how Mort transformed himself. I would like you to share a little more detail on:
1. besides being a consultant and observing your previous customers from another perspective, how did you transform your own thinking about leadership? was it a reflective process ?
2. what kinds of seminars helped you to transform your organization ?
Thank you for sharing your process and contributing to others.
No seminars, no consultants, just getting older and thinking a bit. I think my parents, my environment, my colleagues, my age and my family are the reasons why I changed. Or was it spiritual? Have no idea except that it happened.
Thanks so much for your wonderful article in Fast Company. As a former EDSer who left because of the impossible corporate environment, I was touched, amazed and deeply encouraged by your story. Too many government contractors (my own employer included) try to be ""little EDSes"". I'm glad you've learned otherwise and are taking Perot Systems in a different direction. I fully intend to circulate your article throughout my office. Someone might just learn something.
My own experience with EDS was particularly horrific. For me, joining EDS was a way to establish a stable career without returning to school. (I was yet another liberal arts college grad who became a computer programmer because the ol' history degree didn't sell.) While my internal warning bells chimed loudly, I bought into the young male military model hook, line, and sinker. I tried to be the best man I could be (and I'm a woman). I didn't know just how unhappy it would make me.
I was transferred internally to a project that turned out to be a real death march. For over a year, I put in 16 hours a day, 6 days a week. I gained almost 100 pounds in the course of that year.
EDS fed us dinner every night, but they always brought in greasy fast food that added the pounds to my small frame. My workload didn't let me get to the gym to burn it off, and at home, I started to stuff myself because of the stress (and frankly, because I had some nasty abusive managers and I felt pretty sorry for myself). Then I started having panic attacks and basically acting pretty crazy. I was asked to find another job and resign. They said I was ""immature"" and ""emotionally unstable.""
I learned that my panic attacks weren't caused by immaturity or emotional instability, but were a chemical reaction to high stress situations - in short the managers at EDS had penalized me for having a medical condition, and I was naive enough to let them get away with it.
Name withheld by request
Boy your story is scary. I believe that the project was tough and your medical condition didn't come to light until later.
I am a Training and Organization Development change-agent-type-person for the Mead Fine Paper Division in Chillicothe, OH. I read your article in Fast Company and found it quite inspiring. My job is to make this kind of ""aah haa"" happen here. Before you roll your eyes, I know that I cannot make it happen - I am attempting to set up an environment that would help make it happen for more people (better?).
I am intrigued by the workshop you mentioned - ""We initiated a companywide program to teach us how to disagree with each other without tearing each other down."" Can you please tell me if this workshop was done by an outside company and if so, by whom? We could certainly benefit from this.

Glad you put in the rolling of my eyes, since I did just that until you cleared it up.
The name you're looking for is George Parsons.
Thank you for your testimony of the power of transformation in a company setting. Over the last five years I have experienced a similar metamorphosis in my life, and it was with great joy that I ""saw myself"" in your works, complete with the happy ending!
The personal change you allowed yourself to undergo and the resulting successful turnaround of the company will help lots of other heart-led leaders to take flight!!!
I appreciate this note, but who are you?
Wordplay! is the name I use for my consulting business. I have been exploring different ways to balance my business life with my life as a single Mom, without going back to the VP level position I had before. I've worked for many years in the creative side of business, marketing ""show business for business"" production companies, and have participated in several ""start ups.""
Fast Company magazine is the type of information that somehow finds its way to me. I am always interested in improving and finding out what innovative people are doing to live more joyously.
I'm a spiritual journeyer and explorer of the many ways to enjoy life and express creatively - through writing, etc. Thank you for asking. I enjoyed the opportunity to reply. Have a great day! The stars are out!
I wish you the best in your pursuits of the happier path. Be well. I hope you live in Santa Fe where your ideas would be in vogue.
I am a student at the school of Hotel and Restaurant Management at Northern Arizona University. This semester I am taking a class on hospitality leadership and in that class I had the chance to read your article on leadership. Your article was very inspiring for me as I would like to be a leader in the future rather than just a manager. I have two questions:
1. what are the leadership challenges for the next generation of leaders?
2. what are the leadership opportunities for the next generation of leaders?
I realize you are a busy person but would greatly appreciate your reply. Thanking you in anticipation.

Challenges: not that dissimilar to ours: create jobs, help customers, make a reasonable return on invested capital, have fun, create a great environment for your associates.
Opportunities: DO IT BETTER THAN WE DID.
I have wrestled with similar, albeit smaller scale demons here for the past few years. I hope that your vision, and my conviction that putting the individual and their life ahead of the rest will generate the best result can dominate American business. The transformation of US healthcare to a ""new business model"" has lost sight, in many cases, of this truth and has cast away the one thing that has tied people to this industry - creating value.

Thanks for your message. I am curious about your comment about US Healthcare. In my past life I was the healthcare guru at EDS for my first 7 years in the technical trenches. US Healthcare and all managed care people were nits then.
I had a chance to read through your article ""What I thought I knew about Leadership is Wrong"". OOPS! It was amazing and the best article I have read on leadership in recent times. The other articles/books which come the closest on leadership are Herman Miller CEO, Max De Pree's ""Leadership is an Art"" and Jack Welch's biography.
For Youngsters like us with a vision to develop and lead a world class company sometime in the near future, articles from people like you are the foundations on which we are going to build empires.
Thanks a ton and enjoyed reading your article thoroughly.
Thanks for the message and compliments. You put me in favorable company that I am not sure I deserve. Welch is a very effective ""big time Leader"". I think of myself as a good guy, but technical and not so big time.
Although you have clearly been successful in ""generating a team of people who support and nurture each other,"" most people need to learn how to do it. They need to learn how to criticize so the criticism is viewed as a gift, they need to learn how to benefit from criticism rather than respond defensively, they need to learn how to genuinely listen, not just to the words but the meanings behind them, and more.
Many people call what I've been teaching and writing about for 31 years ""common sense."" But, as you know, the wisdom known as common sense is not very common. But, I feel it can be learned. That's why I wrote Managing with Wisdom (Pelican Publishing, 1996). It is a practical ""how to"" book on developing wisdom. I have a home page on the Internet http://condor.depaul.edu/~jgrossma, where you can go to learn more about my book and me.

"The Four Horsemen of the Economic slowdown
There has been much debate here at CAPS regarding inflation/deflation. I would like to muddy the waters with a few random thoughts.
Anyone who has been to the supermarket or a gas station in recent months is painfully aware of PRICE INFLATION. A gallon of milk or a pound of ground beef as well as most of the items on your shopping list seem to be slowly creeping up in cost each week. With increasing costs of raw materials/ingredients, manufacturers have a difficult choice: raise prices or reduce the size/weight/quantity of their retail products. I have been somewhat suprised at the frequency this year when companies have actually done BOTH. (Half-gallon containers of ice cream are rapidly being replaced by 1.75 quart packages by most producers in my local grocery.) Companies across the board have struggled in recent years to absorb raw material and energy costs, and are now forced to reduce quantity to maintain a price point or pass along these costs to the consumer. I am aware that reduced demand naturally forces prices to decrease, but given the choice to freeze/drop prices or simply close up shop, the latter increasingly makes more ""business"" sense.
The much heralded minimum-wage increase was widely debated this year and was probably long overdue. It is, however, the latest impotent attempt in the past several decades to deal with the reality of STAGNANT WAGES. Increases in mechanization, productivity, and globalization of labor have all contributed to the effective loss of purchasing power by the working middle class. One- income families become two-income families as a couples feel the need to enter the workforce to maintain their desired standard of living. There is continual discussion with regard to America's ever increasing perceived need for more stuff (necessities vs. luxuries, keeping up with the ""Jonses"" etc. ). Yet it is crystal clear that more and more households, whether single- or dual-income are struggling to remain solvent let alone get/stay current on their bills.
As the Motley Fool is a financial website, we are all well aware of the price fluctuations of equities. The past decade has been difficult for conservative, ""small-time"" investors to say the least. Well-worn phrases from the ghosts of the past such as ""buy and hold"" seem less relevant than ever in the computerized, dirivitized (if there is such a word) twenty-first century. We all hope to ""invest"" in assets that will appreciate in value over time, whether stocks, bonds, real-estate, or personal businesses. Of late, global markets and economies have confounded the brightest minds on Main Street and Wall Street. Economic cycles and rotation of classes within markets are to be expected and profited from by the informed investor. With the painful memories of several ""bursting bubbles"" fresh in our memories, namely dot,com and housing, the harsh reality of ASSET DEFLATION has become the latest lesson learned by comparatively young investors. ""Things"" do NOT always go up in value. A generation of Americans has been conditioned to expect unlimited easy credit as well as ever appreciating values of homes, real-estate and equities. Unfortunately that which goes up may/can go down. Many of the items we pay the most for in life and hope to ""own"" the longest (houses, autos, pensions, etc.) are for the first time for many people worth less, much less, than they were a month or year ago. The term 'upside down"" applies to more and more home, property, and auto owners every day.
Finally to the crisis-de-jour: CREDIT CONTRACTION/DESTRUCTION. The CAPS community has done an excellent job educating its readers as to the house of cards known as fractional banking. The U.S. economy has roared along on the premise of everyone borrowing money for any and everything. Constant unsolicited offers for credit cards, banks loaning money to the homeless (figuratively? literally?), people using home equity as an ATM, putting daily necessities on revolving credit- all this fiscal insanity is now coming home to roost. Now that the truth is slowly trickling out about the severity of the situation, from the Federal government to huge corperations to State and local governments to your neighbor next door, things are going to change. Banks, which make money by lending the same dollar out to five or ten people have suddenly decided to get picky about the customers to which they loan. Verifyable income, tangible collateral, and excellent credit scores seem to be irrelevent today. It seems their questionable buisness practices of the past several years (decades?) have come back to bite them big time. So now in the fantasy world of the Federal Reserve they just fire up the printing presses one more time. The federal gov't borrows another trillion to use for corperate welfare, mega-bank buyouts, and token ""stimulus"" packages to keep the masses momentarily pacified. The founding fathers are likely spinning in their graves.
This could very well be the perfect financial storm of our lifetimes. The global powers that be may once more manipulate, fabricate, spin and deceive their way out of a U.S. recession or depression yet. Be careful where and how you place your bets.
Thanks for letting a novice vent, I admire the knowledge, generosity, and passion of the CAPS community. I have real $ in the market and still have much to learn!",en,web

A man who police said injured two officers when he rammed two police cars with a stolen SUV at the Waikele KFC Restaurant's drive-through window in 2009 pleaded guilty to assault and other charges Friday in state court.
Jeremiah Lopez III, 24, pleaded guilty to first-degree assault, two counts of assault against a law enforcement officer, terroristic threatening, criminal property damage, driving a stolen vehicle, and drug and drug paraphernalia possession.
Police shot Lopez twice in the chest and once in his right arm during the Nov. 3, 2009, confrontation.
In return for Lopez's guilty pleas, the prosecutor promised to recommend a prison term of no more than 10 years when Lopez is sentenced in September. The prosecutor also agreed to dismiss a first-degree robbery and other assault and threatening charges. The robbery charge carries a mandatory penalty of 20 years in prison.
One of Lopez's passengers in the SUV, 26-year-old Cherish Craig, pleaded guilty Friday to misdemeanor assault.",en,web

"The American Museum of Natural History lecture series presents Mark Van Stone, author of 2012: Science and Prophecy of the Ancient Maya. He will be discussing the truth behind the cataclysmic rumors and unlocking the secrets of the complex Mayan calendar.
Van Stone left his job as a physicist to pursue a carrier as a calligrapher and a carver. He received a Guggenheim Fellowship which took him around the world where he studied manuscripts and inscriptions from many different nations. Of all the calligraphic styles he studied, Van Stone chose to focus on the Mayan, which is the most complex and least understood hieroglyphics. He spent the last several years decoding the Mayan calendar and what it really says about the year 2012.
Join Van Stone at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City on Wednesday, October 10th at 6:30 PM. The lecture will be held in the Hayden Planetarium Space Theater. For more information and to order advance tickets check the 2012 and the Maya:It’s Not the End of the World page. For more information about Mark Van Stone you can check out his web site.
Traditional lecture formats are a staple for modern education (Source: Andrew Scott, on Flickr)
Eric Mazur is a professor of physics at Harvard. Like many successful academics, he was trained to teach in the same way he learned — standing in front of a room filled with students and lecturing them on the fundamentals of Newtonian mechanics (among other things). If his course evaluations and lack of empty seats are an indication, Mazur is apparently quite good at this.
The lecture is an old form of education. In the days before printing, it arose as a means of mass producing books. One person would read a master copy, and others would write what they heard. In the digital age, however, we are a couple major technological paradigm shifts from that being an efficient way to disseminate information. Arguably, it was never the best way to learn.",en,web
"when i was very young my papa had a small cheap keyboard. i have no idea why my papa needed a keyboard. although he never listened to music, that i remember, he was somewhat musically inclined. he played the accordian and ""roll out the barrel"" to one of the beats on the keyboard, among other little ditty's. i loved the keyboard. i played jingles i heard on commercials and ""roll out the barrel"" constantly. i played old television show intros. i listened to the little songs programmed into the keyboard and i learned them. i remember my nana coming into the spare bedroom where the keyboard was at and telling me to turn it off. she meant to make it stop playing the song programmed into it. then she saw that it wasn't the keyboard playing, but me. lo and behold, i could play by ear, and surprisingly well for such a tot.
bam. i was in piano lessons. for my first lesson my wonderful teacher----a highly eclectic woman---asked me what i knew. what a weird question. i'm here to learn piano because i don't know how to play piano, i thought. i told her i didn't know anything, really. i played for her ""chopsticks,"" ""roll out the barrel,"" ""green acres,"" and both parts of ""heart and soul"" at the same time. she was impressed and said we'd do fine.
then we played scales and chords forever and ever. i thought i'd never learn to read a real song. scales and chords with pennies on the backs of my hands to keep them in the proper position, finding notes with a book over my hands so i couldn't see the keyboard, and more scales and chords. forever. then one day she played a song from a sheet of music for me. and then i played it. i READ the music and i PLAYED it! i think it was called ""falling leaf"" or something like that. i still really like that little song.
i became very good, and more than that, i really enjoyed playing the piano. it was the light of my small life.
then my teacher had to move. all the other piano teachers in town were booked, not to mention we couldn't really afford them anyway.
then the annual fourth grade choir concert came along, of which i was in. while waiting on a ride home from school i was hanging out in the choir room. my choir teacher was in her office. i sat at the piano and played the time away. i played all the songs we were singing for the concert plus a song i had written in the key of e minor. (once i learned that e minor chord i really took off, hee hee.) my teacher came out and asked me how i knew the songs. i told her, ""because i heard them."" she asked me where i learned the last song and i told her, ""i wrote it."" she tested me a bit and thought a bit and then sat down on the bench with me and said, very sweetly, ""how would you like to be the accompaniest for the concert?"" i was so proud. yes. of course i would!
so, i played the whole concert entitled ""i love music."" at the end of the concert my teacher went to the mike and told the audience the story of why i got to be the accompaniest and then she asked me totally out of the blue, would i play the song i wrote. i was quite unprepared, but went and played it. i even added to it, as even then i could never do the same thing twice in a row. i ended oddly, hah, but i got my first standing ovation.
the piano teachers came out of the woodwork then and i got the best one in town, i think.
she was amazing. she let me get away with things she wouldn't let any other student get away with. we were supposed to have a practice chart and have it signed by our parents. nope. never did that. i tried, but not very hard. she wanted me to play certain pieces, especially ones that capitalized on the speed with which i could play (truly, i think,it's because i've no sense of timing, haha, so i just play fast. but i am capable of playing really fast. so fun.). i wanted to play bizzarre anti melody avant garde pieces. she wanted me to learn hymns. i HATED playing hymns. she wasn't quite sure what to do with me, i don't think. i was a bit rebellious. plus, i think we were always behind on our payments. my dad says we still owe her a payment, poor thing. but, she told me that i had something in me that couldn't be taught, that i could feel the music, and that it was good, so she stayed my teacher nonetheless and she taught me quite a lot.
i got to do a lot of things with piano. i was guest pianist at various churches. i was even a guest player at a very talented person's senior recital, for which i was shocked and honored. i went to a few competitions. i don't think i ever won. some of them were just playing for people who sort of graded you. i also got to record it and a musician friend of mine in denton used it on his album, ""c'est cheese.""
i remember dad and i going to wal-mart late one night to pick out an outfit for a competition. i don't know why i remember this outfit. we had a hard time finding anything and ended with a blue pleated skirt that i had to roll up at the waist, a big white low v-neck sweater with a blue turtle neck underneath and some borrowed, too-big black pointed toe flats. i had the 80's hair and funky glasses to boot. it was not a pretty picture. i just remember hiking that rolled waist up over and over again. when it was my turn to play i went in and nailed it. my dad was standing outside of the door listening and when i came out he had this little gathering around him that, of course, all knew i was his daughter. they were applauding and i got that one armed wrap around hug that squishes your shoulder into your ear.
and then, sometime around 9th grade, i think, my teacher moved. i never got another teacher after that. i don't think i ever reached my full piano potential.
i kept singing and played trumpet and frenchorn and learned a good bit of the other instruments. (excluding reed instruments. blah. i can't even make a clarinet honk.) early college i got a guitar and can mostly satisfy myself there. i sound better than i am and i have to fake an f chord.
i haven't really played the piano since the middle of highschool.
benji got a keyboard last week to use with his sound design. i still have no idea what the hell he's going to do with it, but haven't quite expressed it. my only concern was because it was expensive, but it's his money so i won't question and look forward to seeing what he comes up with.
again, benji got a keyboard last week, and i dug out some old music. there are things i played in 6th grade that i cannot touch now. i don't know whether i should feel good, because i used to be good, or awful, because i'm so bad now. i've been brushing up. so far i've attempted ""invention no. 13"" by bach, ""rondo alla turca"" by mozart, a few prelude's by chopin, ""fur elise,"" of course, by beethoven, and an old favorite, ""solfeggietto,"" by bach. i can get through them, but they are struggles now. going through with the right hand, then the left, then measure by measure then just announcing, ""fuck it!"" and playing my little heart out, mistakes and all.
i cannot explain to you how good it feels. i'm quite determined to get as much as i can back, and to contenuie to play as often as i can.
yesterday, i played with penn on my lap. i played him right to sleep. i do not know if that is a good thing or a bad thing, but i'm quite sure i'll try it again to see if it works.

"Several stories of interest have broken over the last few days, and they’re all related to the state Senate Republicans’ battle to hold their four-seat majority.
First, of course, was the word of U.S. Rep. Sherwood Boehlert’s long-expected retirement. The fallout started immediately (as chronicled in part here Friday). State Sen. Ray Meier, an Oneida County Republican,Â has press conferences scheduled in Utica and Binghamton Monday (see the Observer Dispatch). It’s safe to say he’s in the race. Check out his Web site, created even before Boehlert’s announcement – very amusing.Â
Meanwhile, Westchester County Legislator Andrea Stewart-Cousins, who came within 18 votes of unseating GOP state Sen. Nick Spano in 2004, is poised to announce today that she’s going to make another go of it. Senate Minority Leader David Paterson and Sen. Liz Krueger, chair of the Senate Democratic Campaign Committee, are both scheduled to be on hand for the Stewart-Cousins event. YouÂ can bet the Democrats are going to put a considerable amount of their limited resources into thisÂ key race.
Out in Western New York, the Madison County GOP endorsed state Assemblyman Jeff BrownÂ to run for the state Senate in the 49thÂ District. Madison is the only full county represented in the heavily gerrymandered district.
Tom Dadey, who ran on the Conservative and Independence party lines in 2004 after failing to receive the GOPÂ line,Â was also seeking that nod.
The three-way race two years ago between Dadey, former Republican state Sen. Nancy Larraine Hoffmann and Democrat Dave ValeskyÂ split the GOP vote andÂ handed Valesky the victory.Â Keeping Dadey out of the race this time around would improve the Republicans’ chances of winning back that seat, although Valesky now has the power of incumbency on his side.
Dadey made news recently when he decided to go public with the story that he was fired from the Albany-area firm of Clough HarbourÂ & Associates because he refused to say he’d stay out of theÂ Senate race.Â Dadey suggested Bruno, who has made it clear he supports Brown to challenge Valesky, pressured the firm (which has given more money to Republicans than Democrats) to dump him. Bruno’s office denied that allegation.
(Parting note: I neglected to mention Sen. John Marchi, 84, of Staten Island, who left Albany Medical Center Hospital March 8 after receiving treatment for an esophageal tear. Marchi, the nation’s longest-serving legislator,Â is definitely running for re-election – or so said Bruno at a Times UnionÂ editorial board meeting last week. I asked the majority leader what had caused Marchi’s esophagus to tear, and Bruno said it was too much coughing).Â",en,web

New lines increase HDPE bottling capacity by 600%
Southwood Pharmaceuticals cuts labor and overhead costs, while boosting speed and efficiency.
Packaging line consultant Art Stevenson says of CVC’s involvement in the project “I have never known a line not to depend on a full-time mechanic until now. Anything I have ever asked of CVC they have done and done it quickly. They go back and fix whatever problem comes up. They have been absolutely amazing to work with.”
Southwood Pharmaceuticals Inc. provides custom prepackaged medications in tablet and soft- and hard-shell capsule forms to physicians group medical practices and specialty clinics. To better serve its growing customer base the contract packer recently installed three new bottling lines at its 42-sq-ft facility in Lake Forest CA.Southwood enlisted the services of Art Stevenson Art Stevenson Consulting to assist in selecting the line machinery and overseeing the installation of the new packaging lines. Stevenson recommended CVC Technologies Inc. as the main equipment supplier—based on the company’s competitive pricing excellent reputation high-quality service and ability to supply most of the major packaging line components: bottle unscramblers that orient and set the bottles upright for filling; 12-channel electronic counters/sorters/fillers with 32 in-line sensors; cotton inserters; cappers; tamper-evident banders; label applicators; and pack-off station turntables.The three lines housed in three separate packaging rooms fill 75- 120- and 225-cc high-density polyethylene bottles with various pharmaceutical and nutraceutical products. The HDPE bottles are supplied by Paradigm Packaging and plastic closures are supplied by Pacific Packaging Components Inc. After filling desiccant packets are deposited by desiccant placers from Azco Corp. who also supplies the desiccant packets. After cotton plug inserting flexible membrane inner seals are affixed to the bottle mouths using induction sealers supplied by Pillar Technologies.Label printing of specific product copy and identification coding is accomplished using printing equipment from Zebra Technologies. The pressure-sensitive wraparound paper labels applied after the tamper-evident bands incorporate 4 tear-off identification tabs that can be removed and filed for record-keeping purposes at the medical clinic or other healthcare facility.At the pack-off stations bottles travel on large round turntables and are manually packed into 25-count corrugated boxes. The boxes then are handled by a shrink wrapper from Preferred Packaging Systems Inc. that applies film wraps and routes the boxes through a shrink tunnel.Improved performance and productivity
Changing over the lines to accommodate different medications and bottle sizes is quickly accomplished by manually adjusting the guide rails and punching the new product memory parameters into the touch-screen control panel.
The three new lines combined operate at speeds of approximately 120 bottles per day on an 8-hour shift. The old lines delivered about 20 bottles per day.
Southwood’s director of operations Grace Gonzales notes “Not only have these new lines increased our packaging capabilities by 600% but they also have changed the way we do business. They have decreased our labor costs provided high levels of compliance sped up packaging rates and dramatically lowered our overhead costs.”

"Why Would the FDA Make an Academic Article About Potential Benefits of Raw Milk Go Away?; Profile on Food Rights Advocacy
Okay class, pay attention.
Today's subject of discussion: academic freedom.
Enough with the groans, everyone. I know it's not the sexiest topic when it comes to food issues, but you may change your attitude when you hear the story I'm about to tell you.
Two weeks ago, I wrote a post about what I thought was a well balanced scientific assessment, by a prominent
international science writer, of several large-scale research studies out of Europe about the potential health benefits of raw milk (with the unsexy title, ""The evidence around raw milk""). It was published in SPLASH, the newsletter of the International Milk Genomics Consortium (IMGC), which is housed at the University of California, Davis.
The IMGC has been doing research for years on the benefits of mother's milk, and obtains financial support from the California Dairy Research Foundation (CDRF), a nonprofit arm of the state's conventional milk industry.
The IMGC has begun extending its research in recent years to cow's milk. Potentially dangerous territory, as we all know, since those who regulate milk in the U.S. think everything that needs to be known about milk is known, as in pasteurized milk is wonderful and unpasteurized milk is deadly dangerous.
But the newsletter article from the IMGC didn't reinforce that view. Yes, it summarized statistics from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control about the dangers of raw milk (""The CDC estimates the risk of a glass of raw milk causing a disease outbreak is at least 150 times that of a glass of pasteurized milk,"" it said at the very outset.)
But after summarizing the CDC data, it explained potentially positive implications of major research studies out of Europe on raw milk. ""The data suggest that raw milk can cause both trouble and advantage to a human body...To be sure, heating milk to 72°C for 15 seconds reduces the odds of a bad belly, but does it also destroy complex proteins and other components that could bolster human health? Apparently so.""
Then, it poured gasoline on the flame it had ignited, by saying that ""there is strong evidence that (raw milk) benefits young children..."" And, turning a roaring fire into an inferno, it added that ""the world needs studies testing whether large numbers of grown-ups suffering from asthma, hay fever, and similar medical problems see their allergies dampen down after drinking raw milk for a prolonged period.""
In retrospect, such statements were akin to standing on street corners in 1491 and shouting out that the world was round. My post went up Oct. 2, presumably a day or two after the October issue of SPLASH went up, with three articles. By last Friday, only two of the articles were still available to all visitors. ""The evidence around raw milk"" had disappeared.
The one- paragraph intro to the third article, ""The evidence around raw milk"", was there as well, but when you click to read more, you are taken to a page asking for your log-in info. So I registered, figuring I could access the article that way. When I received a link to get a password, and got onto the site and tried to call up the article in question, it said ""Insufficient Privileges."" The article had been pulled. And off to the left column of the page, where it showed who had been on the page before I got there, the most recent name was that of John F. Sheehan, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Director of Plant and Dairy Food Safety. (Damn, the evidence the Internet sometimes leaves behind!)
So what exactly happened to the raw milk article? The word I have on pretty good sources (I don't want to identify them because this stuff is so sensitive that jobs and careers could be placed at risk) is that someone from the FDA (Sheehan?) contacted the CDRF and demanded that the SPLASH raw milk article be removed. I'll make an educated guess that the FDA was upset because the SPLASH article asserted that the European research indicates pasteurization may ""destroy complex proteins and other components that could bolster human health.""
I make that guess because Sheehan testified on just this subject before the Maine legislature in 2011, in connection with a (successful) effort by the FDA to block legislation that would have made it easier for small dairies to sell raw milk directly to customers.
He argued in his testimony that the European research on the role of proteins in conferring health benefits, and their sensitivity to pasteurization couldn't have been correct. “Pasteurization does not destroy milk proteins,” he claimed. “Caseins, the major family of milk proteins, are largely unaffected by pasteurization. Any changes which might occur with whey proteins are barely perceptible.”
Back to our lesson on academic freedom. The FDA obviously has a different view of ""truth"" than the European researchers. And certainly, the issue hasn't been resolved. It requires further research and analysis. That is what academic freedom is all about--analyzing, researching, debating, discussing.
The view underlying academic freedom is that no one holds a monopoly on truth. It explains why professors get tenure--so they will feel free to express their views on scientific (or other research) despite the political pressures of the day. Censoring scientific papers is a big no-no within the tradition of academic freedom.
I have no way of knowing whether anyone at UC Davis or CDRF protested to the FDA that pulling the raw milk article was a serious infringement on academic freedom. But I can guess at what the FDA reaction would have been--something like if you were to tell an underworld enforcer trying to sell you ""protection"" that such practices are against the law. A laugh, and then a question: ""Who you gonna complain to?""
But perhaps the FDA should be looking over its shoulder, and asking a different question: How long can it keep its finger in the dike and preventing the Truth from asserting itself?
It's always strange to read about your activities through the prism of (another) journalist, and especially in the context of age. But suffice it to say there is, what seems to me, a nice profile of my activities on behalf of food rights at Philly.com.",en,web

"Borrowing a bit of aesthetic appeal from the Altima and some eye-catching specs from rival
brands, the newly redesigned Sentra has finally come into its own. That freshness should help
attract the appetite of shoppers looking for the perfect economic option.
Nissan Sentra Trims and Features Review
The Nissan Sentra is a small five seat sedan that’s offered in S, SV, SR, and SL trim levels,
along with fuel saving FE+S and FE+SV models. The latter two options come with a rear
spoiler, aero deflectors, and low-rolling resistance tires. Every trim comes with a four-cylinder
engine worth 130 horsepower, and Eco, Sport, and Normal drive modes that help produce either
33 or 34 combined MPG (the base manual Sentra achieves 30 combined MPG).
Things have been expanded inside to the delight, and comfort, of both driver and passengers.
Standard features include basics like power accessories, A/C, and cloth seats, though upper trims
can be decked out in wood and leather trim, heated seats, dual-zone climate control, Bluetooth,
Nissan Connect infotainment with navigation, and Bose audio.
The 2013 Nissan Sentra starts at $15,990.
Looking to celebrate the holidays with the Nissan Sentra? Find it at CarWoo!
How Nissan Sentra Does on Performance
The front-wheel drive Sentra is powered by a 1.8 liter four-cylinder engine that produces
130 horsepower and 128 lb.-ft. of torque. The base S Sentra comes with a six-speed manual
transmission as standard, though an Xtronic CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission) is
available. All other trims get the CVT as standard. Drivers can choose between Eco, Normal,
and Sport modes to help control efficiency and performance, depending on need.
Nissan Sentra Fuel Economy
EPA estimates give the manually driven 2013 Sentra 27/36/30 (city/highway/combined) MPG;
CVT equipped models get bumped up to 30/39/33. FE+s and FE+SV models receive 34
Nissan Sentra Interior Highlights
Part of Nissan’s quest for the new Sentra was improving driver and passenger friendliness,
and they’ve achieved this by adding welcoming space and versatility up front, along with extra
room for backseat passengers. If you are relegated to the second row, you’ll get 37.4 inches of
legroom. Trunk space measures an impressive 15.1 cubic feet.
If you choose, you can build an upscale atmosphere by adding wood and heated leather seating
to the quiet cabin. Nissan Connect offers hands-free texting and voice commands for hands-off
control, and the 5.8 inch touchscreen is also within easy reach for the more traditional among us.
Nissan Sentra Safety Features
Standard on every 2013 Sentra are four-wheel antilock brakes (front disc, rear drum) with brake
assist, stability and traction control, and full-length side curtain airbags. SR and SL trims also
get a rear disc brake option. The Navigation package comes with a rearview camera, and upper
trims get an Easy-Fill Tire Alert system that lets you know the tires are properly inflated.
Nissan Sentra Summary & Overall Review
Nissan has given shoppers what they crave – upscale features at an economical price, good fuel
economy, and enough new tech to show off to friends and family. The 2013 Nissan Sentra is
back, and it’s better than you think.

"2. Alla's friend, Leigha, told her a birthday joke at her party on Saturday. It was too cute to hear her try and master the knock-knock variety:
Iguana wish you a happy birthday!
3. Sometimes it snows in April. Prince, who is from the Twin Cities, knew exactly what he was talking about.
4. Alla woke up to a half-inch on her birthday, which confirmed that we had indeed made the right decision to have her party inside!
5. Elizabeth, thank you kindly. The cookie decorating was a hit. Although my own daughter didn't do so much decorating as dumping half a bottle of blue sprinkles onto a partially frosted cookie and then just scooping mounds of blue into her mouth. 6. Doesn't she just look so gracious. She just wanted to sing sing sing all day, and then it comes time and she just kind of gets quiet and, I want to say, awed, which is how I always feel, like, wow, all this is for me?
7. I'm kind of alarmed that as I sat there photographing her blowing out the candles I actually forgot to tell her to make a wish. I think I might have thought she just knew that. We might have to have a do-over this weekend. More chocolate cupcakes! Or something:)

"The woman at the far end of the kaleidoscope had not been there last week, of this Simon was sure. She was naked or near enough, thinly dressed in a diaphanous veil that left little to the imagination.
“Holy shit!” Simon Alexander breathed on the lens and gave it a wipe with his sleeve.
“I see that I have your attention...” said the woman, “...finally.”
With a furtive glance to see if there was anyone watching, Simon took a closer look.
“You are carrying a beer and a bag of Cheetos.” The woman wriggled suggestively as she strode toward the kaleidoscope’s eye-piece, shedding blue veils one by one. “I’d like a beer, too. But you will have to get me out of this thing first, I think.”
“You are the Virgin Mary,” said Simon, who watched TV shows on unexplained phenomena.
“Perhaps. I might also be a bird of ill omen, a carrion crow. Or a butterfly.
Whatever. I am celebrated for my hijinks and practical jokes, howsomever. Appearances
can be deceiving. Only last week I appeared covering the entire leeward face
of a mountain in
The kaleidoscope was Simon’s secret―after forty-three years of marriage his only secret. Its twisted barber pole spirals of colored metal foil pasted with stars and crescent moons reflected Mylar purples that shone like the sunglasses of a state trooper. Simon kept the kaleidoscope hidden under the eaves at the back of the garage. He had been temporarily banished from the house while Bonnie spread quilt patterns over all available surfaces. Beer and Cheetos were forbidden inside the house.
“Is this contraption yours?” said the woman. She was surrounded by a pale blue aura. “Good luck for you that I showed up in a portable apparatus.”
“Then you are not the Virgin Mary.” Cellophane crinkled as Simon reached into the bag which he had retrieved from under the front seat of the family sedan. Dinner was hours away.
“You were expecting someone else?”
“Ah, no. I was expecting some colored glass beads.” Simon wished that he
had bothered to shave that morning. “It’s a Boy Scout project from sixty years
back. Katahdin Council,
“Easy with the shaking. These Boy Scouts you speak of, they are a cloistered order? Lay brothers? And you are eating in front of me.”
“Sorry.” Simon popped an orange-colored salt-slathered cheese-flavored Cheeto into his mouth. “I was hungry.”
“And thirsty too, I’ll warrant. I am the Princess Ackaetia Uroonous. You shall be my chosen champion. Name please?” She jiggled.
“Simon. Simon Alexander. Princess, princess, ahh...”
“Uroonous. Princess Ackaetia Uroonous. Practice saying this. And I know all about you. I have watched you from the other end of the kaleidoscope. I call you Big Eye. Does my name not roll on the palate like a scented oil?”
“It is a first-rate name, alright.” The princess was naked and lovely and that she might have a mellifluous name was not of paramount concern. “I did think you were the Virgin Mary for a minute there.”
“Hardly. But in one or two negligible planetary systems I am revered as a goddess.” The scope virgin struck a demure pose, eyes averted in modesty. “Hence I require champions who are trustworthy, reverent and brave. These Boy Scouts you speak of―they are warrior monks? With the single-minded devotion of a religious community?”
“Well... a scout is cheerful, trustworthy, obedient, clean, brave and reverent. I was an assistant scoutmaster thirty years running. And loyal. I ran a tight ship―no booze, no dope. We encouraged abstinence before marriage. Hey, the kids were only twelve years old.”
“As you are my chosen champion, I shall accept your assessment. For the time being. We shall have to get me back where I belong, and that is that.” Simon took a deep breath and held it as blue veils rippled and slithered to the, well, floor. The apparition arched her back to better display her breasts. “We’ll have to get together and urinate sometime,” she said.
“I am not yet fluent with your idiom,” said the Princess Ackaetia. “I spoke wrongly? I had hoped to be alluring. You may breathe now.”
Simon chugalugged his remaining beer. “Take it from me―you are definitely alluring.” He adjusted the focus.
“And don’t fidget. It is unbecoming.” The Princess Ackaetia was beginning to fade. Simon gave the kaleidoscope a shake and banged it against the wall.
“Ouch!” said the Princess Ackaetia.
“Uh, sorry,” said Simon. “Are you by any chance from another dimension?” In addition to his television habit Simon was an avid reader of science fiction.
“Alas, I was fleeing ravishment or abduction and did not watch where I was going. And now I am wedged in an oubliette at the bottom of my garden. I had slipped away to meditate. Prince Philo Gulesi is hounding me for my maidenhead and I must trust to the kindness of strangers.”
“Oubliette? Prince... Philo Gulesi?”
Princess Ackaetia sighed. “A hole in the ground, at the other end of your kaleidoscope. And a very not nice person, to answer your questions in the order presented. Pull me through. There is a lot of me and I am considered odiferous by some species. You will want to do this out-of-doors. And I suggest a pair of rubber gloves.” Overhead a questing crow gave a squawk as it miscalculated its bearings and flew headlong into a power pole. “As I said―a bird of ill omen,” said Princess Ackaetia.
Simon returned with a dust mask and the large yellow Playtex gloves Bonnie kept under the kitchen sink. He had stuffed the mask with a handkerchief soaked in aftershave lotion. “Ready.”
“Unscrew the eyepiece, reach in and pull. Careful now. Incidentally, you smell terrible.”
“It’s Aqua Velva.” Simon’s arm extended into the tube farther than the kaleidoscope’s lengthwise measurement would have led him to believe. Instead of the curvilinear woman he was expecting, Simon felt a large, viscous, throbbing mass between his fingers. “Ah, I think I’ve got you.”
“You have. But not there. Here. I am ticklish and that is a very personal place. And do not squeeze. Just pull. Got it?” said the Princess Ackaetia. “Pull!”
Simon pulled. The reek of unfriendly compost assailed his nostrils. He was glad for the hanky. After much struggling, the scope virgin popped out.
“You are a giant slug.”
“The lineaments of beauty are debatable,” said the slug. “I may have misrepresented myself so as to be pleasing in your sight, Big Eye.” The giant slug undulated, slurped and sloshed. “A small deception. What you see is what you get.” She executed a haughty turn like a fashion mannequin at the end of a runway.
“Bonnie is absolutely not going to believe this.” Simon cupped his hands and called, “Bonnie! There’s someone here I would like you to meet.”
A well kept sixty-something woman came to the screen door. “Yes, darling?” She was all smiles; a heart-rending odor of muffins and pot roast with gravy followed close behind her.
“Your wife is very understanding to let you out alone with a princess of the blood,” said the scope virgin. “Is she a jealous type?”
“Don’t go there,” Simon whispered. “Could you possibly come in the house with me and show her I’m not sliding into senile dementia?”
“I am afraid I would leave a slime trail,” said the slug.
“Simon, always bringing things home.” Simon’s wife searched warily, scanning the back yard for a probable source for her husband’s enthusiasm. “Well, what have we today?” Bonnie’s eyes froze on the Princess Ackaetia. “Oh, a great big slug, how very interesting. And how very disgusting. Now we will have to put out bait before we’re overrun. Our lettuce will be ruined. Put a peach basket over it.” Bonnie executed a quick swivel to stomp back into the house. “At your age, too. Dinner is on hold.”
As Simon pondered pot roast denied, the hand which held the kaleidoscope hung dejectedly at his side. A midge or a gnat buzzed from the tube. It performed a series of aerial acrobatics as if getting its bearings, then flew in ever smaller circles about his head. A beam of polarized light flashed between the insect and the tip of Simon Alexander’s nose. “Ow!” Simon grasped his nose and hopped about in agony. The insect then dived at the scope virgin. The bug was angry.
“Big Eye! Should he fire again I am undone,” cried the Princess Ackaetia.
Simon, through his pain, paused to stare at the insect―hovering, prepared to strike―and the slug. “I beg your pardon?”
“Swat him. If he cannot have me, he has sworn to kill me lest a more acceptable suitor find favor in my eyes.”
“Huh! How about that.” Simon raised his arm and swung the kaleidoscope. There was a “ding” as of a BB hitting a can. “Gotcha.” Mylar mirrors and glass beads went flying. The kaleidoscope was demolished.
“Shattered into pieces! My poor, dear oubliette. Now I shall never, ever get back home again. By-the-bye, you have also just destroyed Prince Philo Gulesi’ s battle cruiser.”
“Sorry. I thought it was a bug.”
“Prince Philo’s ship was government property; the over-taxed underclasses will be grumpy. And you have wrecked my gateway in the process. But where are my manners?” said the scope virgin. “You have saved my life. Thank you.”
“Your suitor? But he, Prince Philo, is―was―so small. How do you, ahh...”
“The females of my kind are considerably larger than the males. Or they smaller―whatever. This is an economy of scale.”
Simon checked the ground for kaleidoscope parts.
“Even if you picked up everything you could find there’d still be something missing,” said Princess Ackaetia. “This is a universal law; you’d have a bag of parts is all. And even if you could get them all back together again the refraction indices would be all wrong.”
“The Boy Scouts built it; we can fix it. It may take a while. It has been sixty years.”
“Meanwhile, I am here. And Prince Philo Gulesi is nowhere. This has created an imbalance that will cascade through the fabric of space-time.”
“Simon!” Simon’s wife opened the screen door a crack.
“You are talking to it.”
“But...” The screen door snicked shut.
“Very observant, your wife. We may safely ignore her,” said the scope virgin offhandedly.
Simon turned to follow his wife into the house.
“Ever-amplified, this space-time anomaly will pack all the destructive power of Prince Philo’s demolished cruiser, plus the mass of a displaced princess of the House of Uroonous, multiplied to the 27th power. We shall have some serious mischief.” The regal petulance disappeared from the Princess’ tone. “I don’t mean to be any trouble―thanks for my deliverance and all―but there is great peril ahead.”
“Thank you for filling me in,” said Simon. “Could we talk about this later? Bonnie has a pot roast going for tonight.”
“No, now. We shall have to manufacture so many kaleidoscopes that one of them will have to have the correct dimensional refraction. This will require volunteers. They must be the same who made the original kaleidoscope. We shall have to whistle up these Boy Scouts of yours and negotiate a fix.”
“But they will be old, scattered...”
“You did it once; you can do it again. Prince Philo’s regent is not going to wait on your Bonnie’s pot roast. There will be a war of succession in addition to our space-time anomaly. Billions of lives will be extirpated. Shake a leg.”
“We’ll have to get you covered up. Not everyone would understand...”
“This ’peach basket’of your wife’s sounds appropriate.”
“Come on in the house. We’ll have to use the kitchen phone. The linoleum? Your slime trail? I hope I’m not hurting your feelings, but Bonnie’s new carpet...”
“I am a princess of the blood. We are held to a higher degree of accountability. Linoleum will be fine,” said the Princess Ackaetia.
“Harry Pease should be in.” Simon was warming to the challenge. “He can do a telephone tree to get Troup 136 out of retirement. Careful on the welcome mat. Astroturf,” cautioned Simon.
In the street a car door slammed, an engine revved. Bonnie had left a note pinned to a peach basket on the kitchen table:
I’ll be at
Wearing his aloha shirt outside of the house was a minor rebellion that Bonnie
had never forgiven. By Simon’s lights, most folks who bought them on vacation
never summoned up the raw courage required to wear them in
Harry picked up on the third ring, just as the answering machine cut in. “...not home right now. Wait for the...” CLICK. “I’m here, godammit. Simon? I know it’s you, I got caller ID,” said Harry.
“Harry? Remember when you said I had space aliens living in my teapot?”
“That was 1982. Besides, I meant it as a compliment to your powers of imagination. Have you been nursing a grudge all these years?”
“Nonononono. I got one. A space alien, not a grudge. Her name is Princess Ackaetia Uroonous and we need your help.” Simon related the morning’s doings.
“So Bonnie’s left you. If I was twenty years younger... Oh, what the hell, come on over. And bring the Princess.” Harry hung up.
“He says yes,” said Simon.
“Thank you,” said the Princess Ackaetia. “This will mean a reprieve for uncounted billions. And now, how’s about that beer?”
Harry Pease rose painfully. “Door’s open. Come on in.” He walked with two canes, his knees ravaged by arthritis, shattered by sports injuries, and at the moment between surgeries. Simon entered carrying the peach basket with the Princess Ackaetia inside. A cloud of flying insects swarmed in behind them and headed straight at Harry’s head.
“Shit!” said Harry. “Holy shit. I thought it was too late in the season.” He reached for the spray can of bug killer he kept at the ready near the door. The insect cloud dropped like a rock. All but for two. Spouting tiny streams of electric fire they made for a spot right between Harry’s eyes. “Yikes!” Harry dropped the bug spray and swung one cane in a roundhouse right. There was a tiny “ding” and a mid-air flash of the kind courting fireflies give. “What the hell was that all about?”
“You have just faced down a direct assault by the remnants of Prince Philo Gulesi’s fleet and prevailed. You must come from hardy stock,” said the peach basket.
“Well, it still stings,” said Harry Pease, rubbing the bridge of his nose. “I don’t recall you being a ventriloquist, Simon. Alright, suppose you have got a space alien in your peach basket. Lemme have a peek at her.”
“You asked for it.” Simon lifted the peach basket.
“A princess of the blood doesn’t get out much. I amuse myself as I may,” said Princess Ackaetia. An oversized garden slug peered coyly up at Harry Pease.
“She was a pin-up girl when I met her,” said Simon.
“Fleeing ravishment or abduction by an unrelenting suitor,” said the Princess. “You appear to have more legs than Simon. Are you certain that this is not Barsoom? One time when my kitten ran off he returned chewing a very entertaining manuscript. About your world? I have to know how it ends. You have a copy.” This was a statement not a question.
“That would be Edgar Rice Burroughs’Captain John Carter series,” Simon said. “Carter of Mars? I have it but it is hard to get at. Bonnie put all my paperbacks away in the attic.”
“As long as you have it; that is enough. I shall grant you an indulgence.”
“Kitten...” Simon breathed easier. That the Princess Ackaetia would have a kitten leveled the playing field between them, the human and the quasi-divine.
“I am trying to use terms with which you will be familiar. A lizard, actually. Rather large and ill-tempered and with a fondness for fresh meat. He ate one of my tutors. I once asked that tutor why is the kaleidoscope and was this particular kaleidoscope a threat.”
“What were your late tutor’s feelings on kaleidoscopes?”
“Much as his feelings on elopement and the bridal consummation. He said I must squinch my eyes together and pray hard.”
Harry paled and sat down abruptly. “Ahh... I beg your pardon, Princess. You said an unrelenting suitor. Prince Philo... who?”
“Gulesi. Philo Gulesi. I have not always been inside a peach basket, you
know. I remember once I showed up in the air space of a thermopane picture window,”
said Princess Ackaetia. “Like mist, you know, in
“Ahh... I’ll do what?” said Harry Pease.
“Stop a civil war, save the known universe. For this we will require the assistance of the original Boy Scouts who built the kaleidoscope,” said the scope virgin.
Harry stared at the Princess Ackaetia. “You are a space alien? Really?”
“I may be an alien here. At home I am queen-apparent.”
“OK, OK,” said Harry Pease. “Enough already. I’m a believer. Simon, I figured you only needed a drink with a buddy. Because of Bonnie and all? I didn’t dream I’d be meeting a bona fide princess who lives in a peach basket and looks like live bait. Simon,” said Harry, “...how old are we?”
“Uh, seventy-two. So?”
“So we’d better get cracking; there are only a couple of us left. Most of
Troup 136 are dead or moved to
“Recreate my oubliette,” said the Princess Ackaetia. “Or your kaleidoscope―it depends on one’s point of view, does it not? It is in all our own best interests. Though vast, infinity is a biography of finite numbers: sooner or later the displacement will arrive back where it started, and then Ka-Boom. Good-bye everything. You want me to write this out for you? For any doubters?”
“You don’t have hands,” Simon observed.
“You will write. I will dictate,” said the Princess.
“Some folks won’t believe anything until they see it in print,” said Harry.
“This is it,” announced Simon to Princess Ackaetia with the pride of a swashbuckler

The sign said Open. Simon and the princess waited, motor running, angle-parked at the curb to see who would show up. At the far end of one line of fluorescent fixtures a plastic pail hung from a leaking sprinkler valve near the ceiling. Beneath it, suffused with an orange Edward Hopper glow, Harry Pease played single-handed Scrabble. Over the next half-hour five gregarious, chatty old-timers straggled in.
“Now,” said Simon, going around to open the passenger’s side door. “Showtime. I hope Harry prepped them to meet you.”
As Simon entered carrying the Princess Ackaetia and her peach basket, the reunited Scouts flashed them the three-fingered salute. On the walls hung salvaged Norman Rockwell posters celebrating the scouting life.
Simon shook the peach basket. “You okay in there?”
“I will be when you stop shaking this damned thing.” There were now seven

A bell on a spring jingled at the front door to announce a late arrival.
“Sorry about that―don’t trust the airlines.” Fleming Ward, called Phlegm in
school, had driven all the way from
“How intimate. Quel sauvage,” giggled the Princess.
“That’s French,” observed Harry.
“Reasonably perceptive, Harry Pease.” The Princess Ackaetia jiggled in thoughtful reverie. “A grotto. A little French girl. She taught me. French, that is. I taught her the rest. She was so sweet.”
“A little French girl in a grotto.” Fleming known as Phlegm crossed himself. “Saint Bernadette...”
“I appeared as a mist,” said the Princess. “You might want to check yourself for stigmata. Like nail holes in your palms?”
Phlegm Ward checked his palms. “Nope.” He blanched and gagged; the Princess had left a slime trail on his hands.
“Oh, how delightful.” The Princess chortled and rocked, the table teetered.
“I have never, ever been to
“Yuck,” said Phlegm. He wiped himself off on his shirt front.
Spouses and wondering adult children packed bag lunches, filled thermos bottles
and car-pooled their loved ones to the kaleidoscope factory. The spouses and
children were not invited in. The Princess Ackaetia held court perched atop
a red leatherette barstool as the
“How many is that so far, Harry?” asked the Princess.
“Over a thousand, your highness. Twelve hundred thirty-eight exactly.”
“Statistically sufficient. Pick one and take a peek.” Harry lifted a kaleidoscope from the nearest folding banquet table. “Wow! I mean, holy shit.” Naked and enticing, the scope virgin was back in the tube.
“Precisely. Yes, I am, am I not?” said Princess Ackaetia from her barstool. “Beautiful in whichever aspect, that is.” Harry handed off the kaleidoscope to Simon. Simon took a look. First into the kaleidoscope, then at the Princess. “But you’re there and here.”
“As I was when first we met, Simon Alexander...” the naked lady in the tube gave her behind a wiggle.
From the barstool the peach basket Princess continued, “...and you should find a telltale circle of charcoal around your eye. It will wash off in a day or so. Another of my little jokes. A memento for when I am gone. If you will all lend a hand, it is time to begin testing the apparatuses.”
Phlegm Ward came from the kitchen wiping his hands on a wad of paper towels. “OK, I’ll play. A big slug says it is a princess. And you guys buy it, all of it.” There was a shocked silence followed by shuffling and distancing but Phlegm stood his ground. “Jesus, Mary and Joseph, just what the hell do we get out of all this, anyway?”
“That is rude,” said the Princess. “Your desires are neither here nor there.”
Simon handed over Princess Ackaetia’s dictation. “Phlegm, read this. She wrote it out for you.”
Phlegm approached the paper warily like a cat stalking in high, dry grass. He studied it closely from all sides, turned it over, hoping to find enlightenment or at least a coupon on the back. “Sounds like something I’d do drunk. Ka-Boom, huh? Total obliteration―and smack dab in the middle of the NBA playoffs most likely.” He turned to the Princess on her red leatherette barstool. “But you still haven’t answered my question. What do we get out of this?”
“Simon gets pot roast and gravy. I believe his wife has been holding dinner.”
“And the rest of us?”
“You deserve something nice. With little evidence that the fabric of space-time would be irreparably rent, and this only on my say-so, few would have had the courage to take up my cause.”
“So? What do we get?” Phlegm’s tone was accusing, uncalled for, in Simon’s opinion.
“You get a peek whenever your little hearts desire,” said Princess Ackaetia. “Time hangs heavy when one is trapped inside a kaleidoscope.”
“Once a scout always a scout. I just wanted a little recognition―you know, like a merit badge. Let’s get to it. Everyone agree?” said Phlegm. “Sorry I got here late.”
“Tardiness is a prerogative of royalty and I shall view this as a compliment to my exalted status. Your persistent hand-washing, however, smacks of lèse-majesté. Apology accepted.”
A few hundred kaleidoscopes in and they found it. “This is the one,” said the scope virgin.
“How do you know?” asked Harry.
“Q.E.D. I’m not in it. Yet.”
“We’ve done it? Saved the known universe, then?” asked Simon.
“I hope you have found it to be a not overly strenuous undertaking.”
“But that’s it? It’s over?”
“It is. Now, help stuff me into this thing. Any volunteers?” To a man, Phlegm
Ward included, Troup 136 Katahdin Council,
“Whew!” said the Princess. “Bye now.”
Simon shook his kaleidoscope. Broken glass rattled. “She’s gone.” He looked again. At the far end of the tube a naked glorious woman parted a curtain painted with fluffy Tiepolo clouds against a sky bluer than blue. She turned to wave.
Harry Pease grabbed an armload of kaleidoscopes and peered through each in turn. “Hey, the naked lady is still in the tube. All the tubes.” He set the kaleidoscopes down and went to check in the mirror. They had left a series of large concentric black rings around his eye.
Harry and Simon returned to their separate houses and their separate wives and hearths. Simon resolved never to tell Bonnie about this. A trans-dimensional refugee saved from an intolerable marriage would make a good enough story, he reasoned; Bonnie was an incurable romantic. Like wearing aloha shirts outside the house and rubbernecking high school girls―who had begun looking good again after he turned seventy―a naked woman in each and every of one thousand two-hundred and thirty-eight Boy Scout kaleidoscopes was a thing best not spoken of.
Happy for their private silences and carrying the empty peach basket, Harry and Simon drove home alone, together. Troup 136 would wear their black circles with the pride of a full sash of merit badges. And Simon would blame his increasingly slippery memory on the direct hit from Prince Philo Gulesi’s neutron cannon.

"By Jeff Kurrus
Andrew Raedeke, waterfowl biologist with the Missouri Department of Conservation, was straightforward in his assessment of current duck numbers in the Show-Me State. ""If you're a duck hunter, you need to be hunting in Missouri this week.""
Colder temperatures and wintry precipitation to the north have pushed large numbers of mallards into north, central, and western parts of the state, including Truman Reservoir and the Four Rivers area. According to Raedeke, more than 800,000 ducks were surveyed on public waterfowl areas during the last aerial survey on November 23, with a few public areas still left to post. ""Numbers from last week until now have not changed dramatically,"" Raedeke says. ""While we've probably lost some of our green-winged teal and pintails, we've definitely gained mallards.""
""Of the ducks we're shooting, about 70 percent are mallards,"" confirms Avery pro-staffer Jason Zerrer, who's based in Columbia. ""We're shooting most of our ducks in flooded milo and corn fields on WRP lands using a lot of motion with our spreads, specifically splashing-water decoys.""
Zerrer also adds that while northern Missouri's big push started about a week and a half ago and continued through Thanksgiving, he expects great hunting for several weeks. ""Ducks aren't going anywhere right now,"" he says. ""I could hunt down toward Truman, but I don't have to. There are plenty of ducks here to hunt, and they'll be here until freeze up. But we're a long way from that.""

"Look For 5 Key Characteristics When Hiring Your Self-Publishing Team
1. Deep experience. It's vital that you don't serve as the guinea pig for a vendor-in-training. You will already face a learning curve with every book publishing contractor — whether you are working with a cover designer, a developmental editor, a book publishing coach, a website or back cover copywriter, an interior book designer, an eBook conversion specialist, a digital printing company and so on. And that expensive list does not include your marketing. For example, you may benefit from hiring a publicist, a substantial additional cost. So unless you are currently involved in — or at least open to — social media, you will miss out on worldwide promotional online opportunity if that publicist is not experienced in social media. No matter who you include on your publishing team, you are looking for track-record professionals.
2. Expertise. You want experts! You want each book publishing professional to serve as a trusted sounding board within their expertise. It's even better if the expert has the big picture overview as well. An expert book publisher, book coach or mentor — someone who has run a small publishing company independently — fits this bill. You could be cheating yourself contracting with someone with only minimal ""publisher"" experience.
3. Flexibility. How will this professional be to work with? Are they willing to change course if you find it necessary? Say, you contract for one set of revisions (i.e., cover comp, or back cover copy) and it's clear you want another direction after all. Include wording for flexibility in your written agreement for this possible outcome.
4. Delivery accountability. Who have you spoken with so far, who may have recently employed your prospective freelance hire, to further check out this prospect? How well were schedules kept? Did s/he make the deadlines? Of course you have to stay on top of delivery promises too. Such is the tedious but necessary ritual of continual follow-up.
5. Heart. ""You've gotta have heart! Miles and miles and miles of heart."" You want a good match in every case, between you and the professionals you are working with because your project is so dear to your heart. If someone is cool to your subject matter but highly skilled at the contract position you have open, are you comfortable with this? If you really want partners who love and believe in your project, go with your instincts and hold off until that special person appears.

"An image grabbed on December 24, 2012 a video released by Jama'atu Ansarul Muslimina fi Biladis Sudan, the radical Islamist group known as Ansaru, reportedly shows unidentified members of the group speaking in an undisclosed place in November 2012. / AFP/Getty Images
KADUNA, Nigeria (AP) - A breakaway Islamic extremist group said Saturday it killed seven foreigners who its members kidnapped from northern Nigeria, according to an online message purportedly from the group.
The message, identified as coming from Ansaru, could not be immediately verified by The Associated Press, though it included photographs the group claimed showed the dead, who were kidnapped from a construction company compound in February. Those kidnapped included three Lebanese citizens and one each from Britain, Greece, Italy and the Philippines - all employees of Setraco, a Lebanese construction company with an operation in Bauchi state, local officials said at the time.
British officials declined to immediately comment Saturday. Two Nigerian military spokesmen declined to immediately comment when reached by the AP, while a presidential spokesman and a spokeswoman for the country's domestic spy service could not be immediately reached.
The message, posted to an Islamic extremist website Saturday, said Ansaru members killed the hostages after British warplanes were seen in Bauchi, in the country's north, by Nigerian journalists.
""As a result of this operation, the seven hostages were killed,"" the group said in the statement. It said a video of the killings would be posted online. An online image accompanying the posting appeared to show a gunmen standing over dead bodies.
Ansaru previously issued a short statement in which it said its fighters kidnapped the foreigners Feb. 16 from a construction company's camp at Jama'are, a town about 200 kilometers (125 miles) north of Bauchi, the capital of Bauchi state. The attack saw gunmen first assault a local prison and burn police trucks, authorities said. Then the attackers blew up a back fence at the construction company's compound and took over, killing a guard in the process, witnesses and police said.
The gunmen appeared to be organized and knew who they wanted to target, leaving the Nigerian household staff members at the residence unharmed, while the foreigners were quickly abducted, a witness said.
In January 2013, Ansaru declared itself a splinter group independent from Boko Haram, the north's main terrorist group, analysts say. Boko Haram, whose name means ""Western education is sacrilege,"" has launched a guerrilla campaign of bombings and shootings across Nigeria's predominantly Muslim north. Boko Haram is blamed for at least 792 killings last year alone, according to an AP count.
Britain previously linked Ansaru to the May 2011 kidnapping of Christopher McManus, who was abducted with Italian Franco Lamolinara from a home in Kebbi state. The men were held for months, before their captors killed them in March 2012 them during a failed Nigerian military raid backed up by British special forces in Sokoto, the main city in Nigeria's northwest.
Boko Haram group earlier claimed the kidnapping in December of a French national working on a renewable energy project in Nigeria's northern Katsina state.

There was a great Hillary
Clinton cartoon in the Guardian:
Off in the distance is the
White House. There is a fence stretching like a tightrope to the White
House. Ms. Clinton is balanced on the fence walking very carefully.
The Washington Diary column
under the cartoon described Ms. Clinton as the front runner far ahead
of her Democratic rivals and now jousting Republicans as well more than
a year before election day. But she must be constantly careful in her
positioning because one mis-step could cost her the presidency.
I'm neither for nor against
Ms. Clinton. Like her husband - and Karl Rove - she is a consummate
politician playing the American political game. What is important to
me is the horrendous democratic failure implicit in this most important
election on the planet as humanity stumbles towards and maybe even over
a climate change threshold with an ever increasing probability of catastrophe,
Climate change danger and
needed mitigation is a life and death issue dwarfing every other campaign
issue combined and US leadership is an absolute necessity if there is
to be an effective multilateral mitigation strategy. America has been
the leader in crafting the present fossil fuel based global economy;
America is the most powerful country economically and militarily and
American based companies dominate the global economy. But America's
leaders are in an electoral straightjacket on this most important issue.
Ms. Clinton and each of her
Democratic and Republican rivals must be very careful to say nothing
about climate change that might offend and alienate either core constituency
members or hoped for swing voters. In fact, climate change is much too
volatile a subject and carefully crafted responses will be used to neutralize
what should be most important election issue ever. The economy, health
care, Iraq, energy, etc will instead be the debated issues of the campaign.
Plus, as always, it's the economy stupid, and leadership blah-blah,
and probably this election whether Republicans play footsy in airport
washrooms or whether Hillary knew about Monica - but didn't really care
cause she's a lesbian.
Climate change and effective
strategies for emission reduction will not be the central issue of the
08 election. No candidate can afford to speak openly about climate change;
no candidate can show leadership in either informing Americans about
the dangers and critical importance of climate change or in building
a platform based upon an effective mitigation strategy. No candidate
will show leadership in questioning whether an effective mitigation
strategy is even possible without governance innovation like the New
Deal or a wartime-style coalition government.
Nobody will show leadership
in using the election to educate Americans the way Al Gore used the
movie medium. Americans now know climate change is real and man made,
but who is going to educate Americans that climate change is seriously
civilization threatening, even humanity threatening; that dangerous
climate change, perhaps even runaway climate change, could lead to extinction
not only for man but for almost all of the flora and fauna with which
we share creation on this small blue planet?
The unfortunate truth is
that Ms. Clinton and her fellow candidates are not leaders and if there
is to be a strong public mandate for emission reduction for the winners
of the 08 election a much more robust American public consensus on the
dangers of climate change and the need for deep GHG emission reductions
now, this decade, will have to be built and forced into the campaign
by scientists and activists already aware of our precarious predicament.
Politicians in America don't
lead - they are pushed. There is less than a year left to build such
a robust consensus on climate change to free up the electoral process,
to push aside the vested interests that do not want change, to create
an opportunity for a climate change mandate so that needed emission
reduction is possible. Those that recognize the danger must get much
more innovative in making state of the art risk and mitigation science
impossible to ignore.

"Investors' Funds Are Recovering, But Not Their Nerves
Originally published on Fri October 19, 2012 10:14 am
Chicken Little was running wild 25 years ago today. But one could hardly blame the poultry for panicking.
On Oct. 19, 1987, the stock market plunged a record-setting 23 percent. The next day, the New York Daily News' front page screamed ""Panic!"" and a New York Times headline asked: ""Does 1987 equal 1929?""
Turns out, the 1987 plunge was a mere stutter step. The Dow Jones industrial average, which closed at 1,739 that day, quickly bounced back. Within a decade, the stock-price average had nearly quintupled.
Financial advisers say the lesson was clear: The stock market rises over time; invest for the long haul.
But millions of small investors are no longer listening to that advice. Yes, it's been a quarter century, with the Dow industrials standing at 13,549 at the start of this silver-anniversary date. But there have been terrifying plunges along the way.
The 2008-09 collapse, in particular, left scars. Between March 2008 and March 2009, the DJIA was cut nearly in half, plunging from 11,740 to 6,547. And don't forget the May 6, 2010, ""flash crash"" when prices fell straight down — and bounced back — for no apparent reason and all within minutes.
Thursday brought another reminder of the frightful volatility of Wall Street. Shares of Google — knocked down by a surprise release of quarterly earnings — tanked so suddenly that individual investors found themselves losing money before they had a chance to sputter: ""What the heck?""
So while the stock market has been moving back up to near where it was before the Great Recession, many people just aren't impressed by experts' stay-the-course advice.
""I'm 69 years old now, and I've been through all of it,"" said David Wilmot, an attorney in Washington, D.C. He's seen the unexplained drops, the super-high-speed transactions, the insider-trading prosecutions — all of it. And it doesn't look good to him anymore.
On Thursday morning, he met with a financial planner to go over his investment strategy for his 70s and beyond. For him, that means making mostly supersafe cash investments because he fears risks coming from Europe and China, as well as from Capitol Hill, where lawmakers must fix the so-called fiscal cliff, a collection of looming budget problems.
He wants safety. ""As you get older, your perspective changes,"" he said.
Lots of people have had their perspectives change since the market peaked in October 2007, with the Dow at 14,165. Even though their 401(k) retirement accounts may be looking healthier than they have in years, the results are uninspiring.
Say that in October 2007, you had put $14,165 into a stock fund that perfectly tracked the Dow. As of Friday's market opening, you'd have $13,549. That would be a loss of $616. Add in the impact of inflation and it's like you've lost $687 over five years. Quite a deal — not.
So while Wall Street analysts are applauding the stock market's rise this year — up 10.9 percent so far — many small investors are sitting on their hands, and wallets. Only 46 percent of U.S. households have money in stocks or stock mutual funds, compared with 59 percent in 2001, according to the Investment Company Institute, which represents mutual funds.
Not only do fewer people own stock mutual funds, but they are reducing the amounts they hold in them. Over the past three years, outflows from mutual funds have totaled $546 billion, the Investment Company Institute says.
In terms of small investors, the good old days were the late 1990s when stocks soared. Then the tech bubble burst in 2000, the recession hit in 2001 and the financial crisis tanked everything in 2008.
Still, this is America. And many people remain optimistic about investing. Julius Terrell, another attorney, was having lunch with Wilmot, his wary, older friend.
Terrell, 45, has a wife and 12-year-old son. He needs his savings to grow to fund his son's college education and ensure a comfortable retirement for himself and his wife. He plans to continue investing and keeping his eye on those charts that show — over the long haul — it's wise to invest in corporations.
""I'm still taking risks,"" Terrell said. ""Everything happens in cycles. You just have to be prepared"" to wait it out until the cycle turns back up, he said.",en,web

"PEORIA, Ariz. -- Angels catcher Hank Conger racked up three hits and five RBIs on Monday, as the Halos took an early lead against Seattle, but the Mariners fought back and earned a 9-8 walk-off win when Julio Morban singled in Francisco Martinez with Angels right-hander R.J. Alvarez on the mound.
Conger ripped a three-run home run off Seattle starter Jeremy Bonderman in the first inning, spoiling Bonderman's first big league appearance since 2010 with the Tigers.
Conger finished 3-for-3 with a double and home run as the Angels jumped out to a 7-2 lead. Mike Trout made his Cactus League debut and went 1-for-2 with a walk and two runs scored, but the Halos again held out Albert Pujols and Josh Hamilton, who is expected in the lineup Tuesday.
Bonderman, 30, is attempting to come back from shoulder and elbow issues that hampered his final years with the Tigers. He gave up three runs on two hits and a walk, throwing 17 pitches in his lone inning.
""It wasn't the way I wanted it to go, but it was good to get out there and get my feet wet again,"" Bonderman said. ""I got a little sped up and then hung a breaking ball, plain and simple. I didn't execute. But it was good to get that first one out of the way.""
The Angels had their own comeback story with former Nationals closer Chad Cordero pitching for the first time since he appeared in nine games for the Mariners in 2010. Cordero gave up a leadoff home run to shortstop Brendan Ryan in the third inning, then retired three in a row.
Right-hander Garrett Richards pitched the first two innings for the Angels, allowing one run on two hits while throwing 26 pitches.
Ryan, making his first Cactus League start for Seattle after being held back in his return from offseason elbow surgery, went 1-for-2 before being replaced in the sixth inning. Second baseman Dustin Ackley also made his first spring appearance and went 1-for-3 with a triple off the left-center field wall in the fifth.
First baseman Justin Smoak was 2-for-2 with a double and is now 3-for-5 with a home run in two spring starts for the Mariners.
Right-hander Brandon Maurer, last year's Southern League Pitcher of the Year for Seattle's Double-A Jackson affiliate, threw a scoreless second inning his Mariners debut, while Andrew Carraway followed with two innings of one-run ball.
Up next for Angels: Josh Hamilton is slated to make his Angels debut on Tuesday against the D-backs' split squad at Tempe Diablo Stadium in a 12:05 p.m. PT game that will be broadcast on MLB.TV. Righty AJ Schugel, ranked by MLB.com as the Angels' 16th-best prospect, will start opposite D-backs lefty David Holmberg.",en,web

It seems strange to have such an affection for a film that is so flawed and fails in so many areas. Either way, I really really enjoyed Nine Songs, a relationship drama told strictly through sex. First, we'll list the failures. The acting of our female lead is a bit suspect and makes her, in the end, unlikable. The photography, although intimate and immediate, suffers from it's DV quality and makes you wonder how beautiful this film could have been shot with the eye of perhaps... Lars Von Trier's dogma lense. Most importantly, the movie relies on two ingredients that in the end prove a bit useless. We are reliving the story in memory via the male lead as he travels through Antarctica. Although it is an interesting metaphor and a captivating landscape, it seems almost entirely unnecessary. We hear him say ""you can be clostraphobic and agoraphobic all at the same time, much like the bedroom."" Secondly, and most important, the live music is inconsequential, although good. The actual image quality is low, the songs play for too long, the lyrics apply to the narrative not at all, and the bands all flirt with one style (Michael Nyman being the exception). I must say, there is an outstanding version of ""Jacqueline"" by Franz Ferdinand.
Now let me tell you where the film succeeds. We experience two young, naive, selfish personalities infatuated with one another, and the idea of one another. This is expressed in the most immediate and intimate fashion: SEX. We see two people in the prime of a relationship, in which the most sex is had, and as much as possible, however possible, symbolizing favors, trust, forgiveness, revenge, and all the other facets of a relationship. These scenes also succeed because of their length, the total lack of music, and the director's willingness to let them exist without explanation. Although these two characters are not even particularly likable or explained to us, we end up feeling as if we've shared something very deep with them, solely based on the extent to which we are asked to hang with them throughout the long and graphic and no holds barred sex scenes.
It may seem sick, but by the end, as a graphic fellatio scene ends with actual ejaculation, you have become so acclimatized to this topic, and it being our main source of communication, that there is an almost unspoken dialogue between all parties. Instead of feeling offended, we feel love for the privacy of the moment, for the trust and sharing that happens there. Instead of feeling aroused, we feel compelled by the motives, interested in the roles played and mindful of the moment shared.
By asking that you step into a theater, with total strangers, and watch many graphic sexual encounters, many unexplained and without the usual Hollywood ramp-up, you have signed over a certain amount of control and comfort as an audience-member, which in the end, offers a truly unique experience of the ""love story"". When all is said and done, ""Nine Songs"" evoked a truly unique and loving response from me, in spite of the fact that as a film, it fails in many areas. I would not say that many films should be made like this, but I would say that it is flirting with a new form of love story that is raw, beautiful and in the end, no matter how many times it fails, honest by the sheer default of it's topic.

A Flash of Steel: Backstory:
In the courtyard of the House Rivadria, swords cleared their scabbards, and the ringing sound of steel on steel broke the silence of the early morning.
One of the combatants--the one falling back defensively--wore the tabard of a House guard, Brevoy’s coat of arms standing beside the sword-bearing falcon of Rivadria. A stocky man with wide shoulders and chest, his weapon was a heavy broadsword, which he hefted as easily as another man might wield an arming sword. Under the tabard he wore a mail byrnie, with thick leather breeches and a heavily-padded helmet, and under these, he was sweating profusely despite the autumn chill, red-faced with effort.
His assailant was a taller, slimmer man, wielding a longer, slimmer blade. Wearing plain riding leathers, he moved quickly, dancing around the apparent guard, raining incredibly fast blows on the thick blade before darting back out of reach. In and out he wove, his forest green cloak--the color of Rivadria--held out in one hand, trailing his movements but not interfering with them. A padded helmet covered his head and face as well.
The cloaked man stepped in after a slow, clumsy swing, smacking the shorter man’s mailed ribs once on each side. Just before leaving the reach of his foe, the cloaked man threw out his free hand in a lightning quick grab, tugging the tabard sideways, throwing off the broadsword-wielder’s balance. This last-second improvisation knocked his counterattack wide, the blade coming down more than a hand-width to the left of the cloaked man.
Angered, the shorter man raised his sword and stepped forward for a powerful overhand chop--and got a slap in the armpit for his trouble.
The cloaked man quickstepped back from the strike and pulled the cloak with him as he spun, flicking the trailing fabric at his foe’s face as the shorter man pounced forward. The distraction halted the eager charge, and when the thin blade appeared from behind the twirling cloak, the shorter man barely had time to raise a block for the shoulder-high slash.
And then that slash dropped and angled upward, driving under the broadsword. The flat of the dueling blade smashed into the shorter man’s temple, and he fell with a small groan.
Even as he toppled, though, a second man bearing a Rivadrian crest appeared from behind, dashing swiftly into the courtyard. He was almost as tall as the cloaked man, and even thinner, wearing no armor but a surcoat bearing the heraldry. Lightning fast, he drew a long, thin rapier and lunged forward, face also protected in padding.
Turning, the cloaked man raised his gloved free hand and slapped the thrust aside. He then stuck his own blade between the thin man’s knees, sending him sprawling, dirt and grass staining the surcoat and its design. Stepping toward him, the cloaked man raised his sword--
Before the strike could even begin, the thin man rose, but rather than attacking or even defending himself, he tore off his helmet. The face underneath was that of a young Taldan, perhaps fifteen, with short, tousled brown hair, hazel eyes, and an aquiline nose.
”He can’t do that!” he said in a pitchy whine.
From the side of the courtyard stepped a man in a suit of gleaming mail, a Rivadrian tabard over it, a blade like that used by the cloaked man at his belt. ”Obviously he can, seeing as he just did,” remarked Swordlord Edrovic Van Ordant wryly. ”And why should he not? It is a valid technique, seeing as your weapon is without cutting edge, Aldger.”
”But--but--” Aldger Rivadria blustered, clearly unready for his teacher to go against him.
”But?” Ordant asked, raising an eyebrow. ”I teach you for years on end in the art of swordplay--you even select a proper sword for it, unlike your brother--and yet you still are defeated.” Edrovic sighed. ”Still, I suppose you all have your talents, and Variziel’s is clearly swordplay.”
The cloaked man sheathed his sword and removed his helmet. From within came a shock of white hair, tied back with a piece of cord, falling to his shoulderblades. Piercing green eyes rested below strands of hair that had come loose in the fight. The face was thin, though not gaunt, and the tapered ears gave it away as that of a half-elf. Variziel was only slightly flushed from the fight, but more color was in his cheeks than normal due to Ordant’s praise. ”Thank you, Swordlord,” he said, bowing.
”You can thank me by helping Master Nathaniel from his place on the ground,” Ordant said, gesturing to the stocky man who had regained consciousness.
Variziel and Aldger helped Nathaniel up, and the third young man removed his helmet as well. His face was sweaty and red, but grinning. ”That was a neat move there, Var. Damned ungentelmanly, and only a fairy like you could be quick enough to do it, but neat the same.”
Variziel grinned back. ”I use what I can,” he said, the Elven in his voice making it clear. ”One hit from you and I’d likely be flat on my arse, and I’d be lucky to have my skull intact.”
Nathaniel laughed, and even Aldger cracked a smile. Ordant himself shook his head at the boys’ banter, but was smiling behind his thick moustache. ”Yes, yes, clever play on all your parts. That was a good usage of Vadril’s Counter, Nathaniel, and a clever adaptation of Marcantis’ Iai, Aldger, and Variziel, you follow the teachings of Swordlord Lebeda quite well. Your reward is cleaning all your gear, twice”--groans from the trio--”and then the rest of the day off until this evening after dinner”--hoots and laughter.
As the young men walked off, Ordant couldn’t help but keep his smile on. Accepting the position as swordmaster at House Rivadria was the finest decision he’d made in a long time.
- - - - -
That evening after another practice drill--this time swords and archery, the latter of which being Aldger’s specialty--the boy had decisivelybeaten his competition--Variziel oiled his gear and stored it back in the armory alongside Aldger and Nathaniel’s belongings before heading toward his bedroom. Walking through the halls of the manse, he caught a drift of conversation. ””
Intrigued, and sure that the comment was about him--he was, as far as he knew, the only half-breed of any kind at the House--Variziel diverged from his course, creeping softly down the hall until he reached the door to Lord Markess Rivadria’s study, cracked open. Wanting to peer inside but fearing punishment, Variziel contented himself with pressing his ear to the door.
”Now, now,” came Rivadria’s voice, ”don’t be hasty, Gerrard. I’m sure the boy is perfectly safe, and I’m certain the Lady means no offense.”
”Then what does the Lady mean?” Responded, somewhat accusingly, Gerrard Rivadria, second cousin of Markess and captain of the guard at House Rivadria.
”There are greater things than this for the young half-elf,” came a clear voice, not unlike Variziel’s own, but that of a woman. ”He deserves to know his heritage.”
”Grandfather disowned Arkan,” Rivadria responded roughly. ”That man cut his ties to Rivadria and all who live here when he left, and that includes Variziel.”
”Like it or not, he is the boy’s ancestor, and Variziel has no life here ahead of him. Not as an illegitimate child descended from a dishonored Swordlord.”
Variziel blinked, confused. This was more than he was prepared to take in. He’d figured, of course, that he was a bastard--after all, he knew his father had been killed in a duel while Variziel was still an infant, and he’d never known his mother--but this talk of disowning and dishonor and a Swordlord was overwhelming.
”And like it or not, the boy is inquisitive.” The woman’s voice grew louder and closer during the sentence, and then the door behind which Variziel stood was thrown open. It revealed to the shocked youth a woman of great beauty, all creamy skin and golden hair and bright green eyes. She was dressed in a deep green formal gown, nearly the color of Variziel’s own cloak, the collar near the neck but revealing her delicate collarbone, the hem at her ankles. More surprisingly, her ears were more pointed than his own, tapering up to rise nearly to the crown of her head. She was the first true elf Variziel had ever seen.
”Boy!” Rivadria cried as he rose, face reddening slightly at the embarassment of his own ward eavesdropping on his private conversations.
Gerrard also rose, frowning. ”Shall I have him whipped, m’lord?” he asked, clearly expected to do so but not relishing the act itself.
”No, no,” Lord Rivadria said, waving a hand. Looking at Variziel, he furrowed his brow in thought. ”How long have you been there, boy? How much have you heard?”
Variziel opened his mouth to answer, but the elf woman cut him off. ”What does it matter, Markess? Tell him what he needs to hear.”
Lord Markess Rivadria sighed deeply, and sat back down, beckoning Variziel forward with his hand. ”Boy--Variziel--I have tried my best to make life good for you, here. You have grown up, more or less, alongside your cousins, my children. You have been taught as they have, for the most part--though I decided not to bother you with tedious lessons of politics and other pursuits of a lord.”
At this comment, Variziel frowned. Pursuits of a lord?
Rivadria caught the look and sighed again. ”Yes, perhaps unfair of me, but you see, boy... No matter how I try, there are limits to your position. You are an illegitimate child, Variziel, and as such, may never inherit the name Rivadria.”
Variziel was taken aback. His “uncle,” as he’d always known him, was telling him they were no true kin?
Gerrard put in, ”Now, boy, keep in mind that Lord Markess has shown you the utmost kindness for a bastard, let alone his cousin’s and a descendant of a disowned man--most families would have you thrown out and never recognize you at all.”
”Thank you, Captain,” Rivadria said, his tone somewhat exasperated. Gerrard meant well, but wasn’t the most delicate speaker. ”The point is, Vyridia is correct: there is not a great life for you here. It is why I was so thrilled to see you take to Swordlord Van Ordant; you could become a great Swordlord in your own right, regardless of station, and it would offer you prestige and freedom that station as an illegitimate child in a minor noble’s house never could.”
Variziel was still confused and taken aback, but he nodded, trying to take it all in.
”But it is unfair for you to be cut off from your past,” the elf woman, Vyridia, said. ”Our history is what makes us who we are--the elves know this better than any. You should know the truth.”
Rivadria sighed again, sounding more tired than he ever had to Variziel. ”And so you shall. Your aunt will teach you, and then you shall decide.”
Variziel looked from Rivadria to Vyridia, and then again. Finally, he nodded. ”I would like to learn.”
As the pair exited, Rivadria whispered, ”I only pray you don’t hate what you find.”
- - - - -
In the guest bedroom where Vyridia was staying--she’d arrived while Variziel was out riding with Aldger and Nathaniel--there was a large trunk, with three padlocks barring opening. From a thin chain around her neck, she produced two keys to fit the locks to either side. She then pulled her dress up--Variziel flushed and glanced away--and removed a third key on a chain from around her thigh. Turning it in the central lock, the chest opened a fraction as it was unlocked.
Vyridia turned to her nephew and said, solemnly, ”Within this container are items that will greatly affect your life, young man. They are the treasures of a great and terrible pirate--your great-grandfather.”
Variziel blinked in wonder and confusion as he looked into the trunk. Resting on a pile of clothing and padding were several objects. The first Vyridia removed was a thin object wrapped in cloth, about four feet in length and roughly cylindrical. Unrwapping the cloth revealed a dueling sword similar to the one with which Variziel was accustomed. It looked old and somewhat worn, but that only gave it an extra level of mystique and wonder.
”His first sword at sea,” Vyridia said with a faint smile. ”Not as well known, perhaps, as the weapon he wielded later in life, once he had become a true Free Captain, but still a pleasant blade. The grip is sharkskin, feel.” Variziel touched it, feeling the smooth but gripping surface of the handle. ”Won’t easily leave your hand, that sword. And this is an added benefit,” she said, lifting the weapon and motioning to the scabbard. ”Specially made with tempered steel. This hits like a club, and it makes a nice backup if your sword ever does leave your hand.” She smiled. ”Though a Swordlord never drops his blade.”
The next parcel was a small box wrapped in silk. Vyridia carefully removed the covering and opened it, removing from the container a deck of playing cards. ”These were also from his early days, used them in ports all across the coast."" She laid the card down and pointed to a part of the design on the back. ”Marked. Your great-grandfather swindled dozens of layabouts and sailors with these.”
”What’s the pattern?” Variziel asked, holding up the card and another, trying to find the difference between the two.
Vyridia grinned mischievously. ”You’ll have to find out yourself.”
Next from the trunk, she pulled a small object, again wrapped in cloth. This, however, turned out to be a pair of strapped leather contraptions. Variziel wasn’t sure what they were until Vyridia loosened one, slipped it over her hand and onto her forearm, and tightened it. ”Wrist sheathes. These, he used for almost his entire career. They certainly won’t hold a sword, but having a trick up your sleeve always pays off.” Vyridia let out a giggle at her own joke and removed the sheath, placing it back with the other and laying them on the bed with the sword and cards.
The next item was simpler: a large drawstring bag, roughly the size of a good waterskin. ”Looks simple, and is, but it’s important for anyone living on the coast, let alone someone living on its waters. This bag has special folds and is made of good material, tarred inside and out. It’s more or less waterproof, though in its condition some might get in after a while. Your great-grandfather used it for his special belongings--trinkets from treasure hoards, mostly. Keep your most prized possessions in here, Variziel.”
The last individually wrapped object in the trunk was very small, but Vyridia picked it up almost reverently. Unwrapping it slowly, Vyridia paused before revealing it. ”Variziel, you must swear to me that you will wear this always, unless it would bring danger. It is the finest, clearest mark of your heritage, though not everyone will love you for it.”
”Of course,” Variziel whispered back.
Vyridia finished the unwrapping and handed her nephew a small ring. It was crafted of steel, mostly, though it bore a flat piece of what looked like petrified wood. A small disc, carved into its surface was a dueling sword crossed with a cutlass of the kind used by sailors. Underneath these were the letters “ABR.”
”Adrian Bloodsword, and Arkan Rivadria. This was his personal mark, just as the crossed swords were his flag.”
”Thank you,” Variziel breathed, slipping the ring on. It was a little larger than his thin, elven ring fingers, but fit perfectly onto his right index. ”But, Vyridia--Aunt Vyridia? How do you know so much about Adrian--Arkan--my great-grandfather?” Variziel looked at her questioningly.
Vyridia gave a sad, beautiful smile. ”I knew him, far back when I was only a young maiden. He and his men came into the port where I lived one day, and everyone was very afraid of them. I had to fetch bread from the baker’s, though, and when I was traveling back to our house, one of the pirates accosted me. I don’t know what he was going to do, but then from around the corner came a dashing man. He drove off my assailant, and of course, it was Captain Adrian Bloodsword himself. I know I was young, and he was an elderly human even then, but he was so charming...” Vyridia sighed.
”I never knew who he really was until much later, when my sister Tellithia met your father. I understand that Adrian sent these belongings to his son Nathan, your grandfather, before his death, but that Nathan hid them away. Of course, Nathan’s son Edran, your father, was the first to forgive Arkan Rivadria for what he’d done, and to accept his heritage, though he never became a Swordlord. He died so young, your father.”
”Do you know why he left?” Variziel questioned. ”Adrian, I mean.”
Vyridia shook her head. ”That, I never learned. I know he was a great man before leaving House Rivadria, and that he looked back often, especially in his old age. Perhaps Lord Markess knows more.”
Variziel nodded, then, after a pause, asked, ”Do you know much about my parents?”
”Only a little, but enough,” Vyridia smiled. ”They were very much in love, that’s certain, and it’s why they couldn’t marry. You see, after my own aunt had taken up with a human and things had gone sour, our family wasn’t very accepting of your mother’s choice for a love. Neither were the Rivadria, for all their tolerance, thrilled at the prospect of one of their own running off to marry an elven adventurer. Your parents loved each other very much, and they loved you more than anything.”
Variziel looked down. ”Then why did my mother leave me?”
Vyridia smiled her sad smile again. ”Things are much more complicated in this world than they should be, somtimes. With your father’s sudden death, your mother was heartbroken--and not a Rivadria. With her only tie to the family being you, she desired to leave, to return to our old home. But old Arkanth Rivadria didn’t want you to go--he was a stubborn and loving old man, that one. And then your mother took ill, and she died only a few months after your father. The doctors had no idea, but we all knew--it was her broken heart. The loss of your father, and the idea of losing you, were just too much for her.” Vyridia’s eyes had welled up with tears, and a single drop fell down her cheek.
Variziel looked up, also close to shedding tears, and seeing one another, they both began to weep softly, embracing as family.
Later that night, Variziel made his decision, and in the morning, he told Lord Markess Rivadria that he, Variziel Dawnshadow, would leave to discover his heritage.
- - - - -
The following morning, Variziel stood ready to leave behind his home. Lord Rivadria had offered to hire a carriage to take Variziel and Vyridia where they wished to go, but the pair had declined, preferring to walk. Within his heart, secretly, Variziel also thought that, perhaps, leaving House Rivadria on his own would be for the best, as he could never dare hope to receive help from them in the future.
Sitting on the stairs that led to the main entrance to the manse, Variziel watched the sunrise with his keen eyes, losing himself in thoughts of pirates and Swordlords. He never heard his visitor until the voice behind him asked, ”Is it true? You’re leaving?”
Variziel stood and turned to see the second child of Lord Markess Rivadria, the daughter who was born between his sons: Alysia. A girl of eighteen, Alysia had been destined for the same fate as so many noble’s daughters until she displayed a knack for the arcane arts. From then on, she had continued studies of being a lady, but they were coupled with lessons on ancient tomes and the Art. She was thin and small, her head barely coming to Variziel’s chest, with fine hair and bright blue eyes, and very pretty. She and Variziel had played together since her youth, and due to his slower half-elf aging, they were now roughly the same physical age.
”Yes,” Variziel responded shortly and softly, not trusting himself to say more. He’d hoped Alysia wouldn’t see him before he left, because he knew it would be the hardest part of leaving--
With a sob, she hugged him. ”Zee,” she let out, calling him by the nickname she’d used as a small girl. Variziel hugged her tightly back, picking her up and twirling her around once, which always made her laugh. She did, and so did he, and he put her back down.
”I have something for you,” Alysia said, pulling a string from around her neck. Variziel blushed a little as she withdrew the object from where it had rested, but she just stuck out her tongue at him. ”I do have a wrap on, you know,” she muttered, untying a ring on the string. ”And in these stupid fancy dresses there aren’t any pockets. Where was I supposed to put it?”
Variziel opened his mouth to answer, but she put a finger to his lips. ”Just be quiet,” she said with a smile, and held out her palm. On it was a ring with the symbol of House Rivadria stamped onto it, a signet ring of the kind Lord Markess wore. ”Go on, it’s for you!” she said.
Variziel picked it up and put it on his right ring finger; it fit perfectly. ”Oh, good, I thought we had the same size,” Alysia said happily. Variziel looked up, and she held out her own hand, where an identical ring sat on her finger. She clasped his hand and called out, ”Quick, Brother!”
From behind a hedge came Brother Calfard, one of the priests who lived at the house. He was an older man, his hair a gray-white color, a beard on his face, and his garments simple. He hobbled up to the pair and smiled to each in turn. Murmuring in a language Variziel didn’t understand, he put his gnarled old hand over Variziel and Alysia’s, and a small white light shown from the trio of hands. He removed his hand and smield again. ”There.”
”Thank you, Brother!” Alysia said with a small curtsy, and Brother Calfard nodded and hobbled off. The girl returned her gaze to Variziel. ”I had them specially made. They’re called sanctified rings; they’ll help us keep in touch. As long as we wear them, we’ll always know that the other is safe and sound. But they crack if one of us takes them off,” she added, ”so don’t remove it! And they’ll also break if you... oh, I don’t want to say it!” Tears were coming again, and she gave Variziel another tight hug. ”Just promise you’ll stay safe.”
The half-elf was touched. ”I promise,” he whispered in her ear.
She pulled back suddenly. ”Oh! I almost forgot! I’ll be right back; don’t you leave, Variziel, or I’ll have Nathaniel and Aldger on you!”
Variziel smiled as she dashed into the house, and to his surprise, her family came out, first her brothers, then Lord Markess, who was talking with Vyridia. They stood in front of him, each with a small bundle in their hands, and there was an awkward moment of wondering what to say until Lord Rivadria cleared his throat and kicked the back of Aldger’s leg, muttering, ””
”” Aldger murmured himself, prompting Lord Rivadria to roll his eyes, and stepped forward. His bundle was the largest, nearly as long as he was tall. ”For you to keep safe in your travels, that you may never find trouble close at hand.” He pulled the string that kept the wrap in place, revealing a fine oak longbow and two quivers of arrows. ”Normals, and special flights that travel further. Practice, and maybe when you come back we’ll have a shooting match. Doubtless I’ll win,” Aldger smirked, then clasped Variziel’s wrist. ”It’s been good, cousin.”
Nathaniel was next. ”Also for your safety, that when you do find trouble close, you are not caught unready.” His package was a small box, and opening it revealed two single-edge daggers, each about a foot in length. ”I’ll miss you, Var. You’ve been good for my swordplay.” Variziel grinned back to Nathaniel and clasped his wrist as well.
Finally, Lord Markess stepped forward. ”For you to keep warm in your travels, and to remember them well, including home.” He shook out the bundle of cloth he carried, revealing it to be a cloak sewn together from many squares of fabric, Rivandria green in color. On the top left inner patch was stitched an image of House Rivandria, the sword-bearing falcon stylized in the sky above the manse. ”Keep us in mind on your travels, swordsman,” the lord said, smiling, and Variziel thought he saw a glimpse of wetness in his eyes.
Vyridia stepped up and gave Variziel a pack and waterskin. ”Already packed with your things,” she said, not meaning the wrist sheathes, sword, and ring, of course, which Variziel was already wearing. ”Put on your new belongings and we can head out--we’ve a long journey before us.”
Variziel slipped the daggers into the wrist sheathes and tightened the straps, then looked up after securing the bow and quivers with his pack. ”Alysia--”
”--is here!” she called out, reappearing in the doorway. Her own gift wasn’t wrapped, and it was clear as soon as she walked up. In her hands she held a leather-bound book with a vial of ink and an inkpen attached. She opened the book to show the blank pages.
”I want you to write everything down in here, and I expect letters as often as you can send them!” she said, smiling. Variziel took the gift with a smile, and set it on his pack, which was still on the ground. Standing, he saw that Alysia was still just in front of him.
”And,” she said, swallowing once, looking almost nervous, ”this is so you’ll come back yourself.” Pulling him down by his shirt, she stood up on her toes and kissed his cheek. ”And this,” she said, lightly slapping his other cheek, ”is in case you don’t.”
Variziel grinned and hugged her again, and then she pushed back, tears in her eyes, before fleeing back into the manse.
”Women,” Nathaniel said with a grin, and Aldger rolled his eyes. Variziel grinned himself, fighting the urge to touch where Alysia had kissed him.
As the pair walked off from the House Rivadria, Variziel looked down at the journal and writing utensils.
Keep your most prized possessions in here, Variziel.
Smiling to himself, Variziel pulled the waterproof bag from his belt and slipped the items inside, then shifted his pack so he could place the bag carefully within.
And so Variziel Dawnshadow set off to find his life...
Important Figures from Variziel's Backstory:
Alysia Rivadria, NG female human wizard 1, 18 years old.
Variziel's closest friend, Alysia is a young woman who has begun to study under a mage. She is the main connection that Variziel still has to House Rivadria, and he keeps a journal and writes letters for her. The ring he wears on his right hand is a match to hers, and the rings crack if either party is killed or removes it.
Nathaniel Rivadria, LG male human aristocrat 1/ fighter (two-handed fighter) 1, 23 years old.
Aldger Rivadria, NG male human fighter (lore warden) 1, 16 years old.

"Heart 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase activation by insulin requires PKB (protein kinase B), but not SGK3 (serum- and glucocorticoid-induced protein kinase 3).

On the basis of transfection experiments using a dominant-negative approach, our previous studies suggested that PKB (protein kinase B) was not involved in heart PFK-2 (6-phosphofructo2-kinase) activation by insulin. Therefore we first tested whether SGK3 (serum- and glucocorticoid-induced protein kinase 3) might be involved in this effect. Treatment of recombinant heart PFK-2 with [gamma-32P]ATP and SGK3 in vitro led to PFK-2 activation and phosphorylation at Ser466 and Ser483. However, in HEK-293T cells [HEK (human embryonic kidney)-293 cells expressing the large T-antigen of SV40 (simian virus 40)] co-transfected with SGK3 siRNA (small interfering RNA) and heart PFK-2, insulin-induced heart PFK-2 activation was unaffected. The involvement of PKB in heart PFK-2 activation by insulin was re-evaluated using different models: (i) hearts from transgenic mice with a muscle/heart-specific mutation in the PDK1 (phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1)-substrate-docking site injected with insulin; (ii) hearts from PKBbeta-deficient mice injected with insulin; (iii) freshly isolated rat cardiomyocytes and perfused hearts treated with the selective Akti-1/2 PKB inhibitor prior to insulin treatment; and (iv) HEK-293T cells co-transfected with heart PFK-2, and PKBalpha/beta siRNA or PKBalpha siRNA, incubated with insulin. Together, the results indicated that SGK3 is not required for insulin-induced PFK-2 activation and that this effect is likely mediated by PKBalpha. [less ▲]Detailed reference viewed: 15 (2 ULg)
Effects of marginal iron overload on iron homeostasis and immune function in alveolar macrophages isolated from pregnant and normal rats.

The effects of changes in macrophage iron status, induced by single or multiple iron injections, iron depletion or pregnancy, on both immune function and mRNA expression of genes involved in iron influx ... [more ▼]
The effects of changes in macrophage iron status, induced by single or multiple iron injections, iron depletion or pregnancy, on both immune function and mRNA expression of genes involved in iron influx and egress have been evaluated. Macrophages isolated from iron deficient rats, or pregnant rats at day 21 of gestation, either supplemented with a single dose of iron dextran, 10 mg, at the commencement of pregnancy, or not, showed significant increases of macrophage ferroportin mRNA expression, which was paralleled by significant decreases in hepatic Hamp mRNA expression. IRP activity in macrophages was not significantly altered by iron status or the inducement of pregnancy +/- a single iron supplement. Macrophage immune function was significantly altered by iron supplementation and pregnancy. Iron supplementation, alone or combined with pregnancy, increased the activities of both NADPH oxidase and nuclear factor kappa B (NFkappaB). In contrast, the imposition of pregnancy reduced the ability of these parameters to respond to an inflammatory stimuli. Increasing iron status, if only marginally, will reduce the ability of macrophages to mount a sustained response to inflammation as well as altering iron homeostatic mechanisms.

"USM Libraries Rare Book Cataloging Procedures
Rare books are those items published before 1825, published under a Confederate imprint (1861-1865) or identified by the de Grummond curator as a ""rare book"" based on the item's value as an artifact and unique qualities. Rare books are cataloged according to AACR2r and full DCRB, deferring to DCRB when rules differ.
Use ISBD punctuation, making no attempt to retain original title page punctuation. If copy cataloging from a record with double punctuation, retain but verify. (0E, DCRB)
I/J and U/V- Seek internal verification of use of i/j and u/v if words appear in all capitals on the title page. For example, do not transcribe a ""u"" as a ""v"" in the 245 if the printer uses u's on the text pages. Retain the ""v"" in a 246 (other title).
Ligatures- Never transcribe ligatures ( ) unless the document is in Anglo-Saxon. Use their modern counterparts, ae, oe, etc. (0H, DCRB)
Accent marks- Do not add accents that do not appear on the title page. This rule is valid even if the words are printed in all capitals (which generally do not have accent marks).
Transcribe small e's over letters as umlauts and small circles over letters as small circles. (App. B, AACR2)

"by Heidi Trautmann
Until recently the monastery was closed off in a military zone but can now be visited without any problem. Like all the holy places it is based on legends.
The legend goes back to 275 when Pantaleon the patron of the monastery was born. To this saint who had studied medicine in his human days, two monks from Lapta were praying to find a suitable place for the construction of a church and while they prayed a spring started to appea,r the place of which is still to be recognised by an Ottoman looking fountain in the centre of the yard.
The prayers were done in 1600 and the monks built a small church right there and placed the icon including the bones of the saint they had brought with them to Cyprus. As is the custom, farmers and their families soon settled around the church, and they gave the place the name of Myrtou (now Camlibel).
It must have been a rich village, judging from the big monastery estate, the main extensions of which were done in the 17th and 18th century. On the saint’s day which is on the 27th July, many people used to come, both from Turkey and Cyprus. There is little to see inside the church now.
In the troubled years the monastery and the area around it was involved in heavy fighting.
It is thought of renovating the monastery but the finances are not yet available.
In my opinion it could easily serve as a recreation home since the saint of the place was a mediciner and has always cared for his people, be they Greek or Turkish. The late bishop of the place had equal humanitarian principles and was mourned by all when he died.
The place was kind of mystic with bright sun rays emerging from behind purple clouds but the rain set in when we left for Korucam, a village just a few miles away closer to the coast.",en,books

"The Thalmor wiped out his family back in Valenwood during one of their purges. Since then, he has hated the Thalmor. The Thalmor don't realize who he really is, giving him the opportunity to infiltrate.
Malborn is the inside man in the Thalmor Embassy. He serves drinks at the parties. He offers to smuggle any equipment the player wishes to take into the embassy.
Upon entering the embassy using the invitation provided by Delphine, the player will be approached by Elenwen. Elenwen will start a conversation, asking a lot of questions, but she is interrupted by Malborn. This is most likely so the Dragonborn doesn't get discovered as an infiltrator. When asked for a drink, Malborn will instead tell the Dragonborn to cause a distraction, so the Dragonborn can slip into the embassy unnoticed. Once inside, Malborn will blackmail the cook not to report both the Dragonborn and himself. He will then guide the player to a chest containing the equipment he smuggled in earlier on in the quest. From this point onwards, the Dragonborn no longer receives any more help from Malborn.
After infiltrating the Solar and finding a prisoner, two Thalmor guards will enter the dungeon with Malborn in custody. His cover is blown. If Malborn survives, he will go to the New Gnisis Cornerclub in Windhelm.
One way to rescue Malborn is to kill the two Thalmor already in the interrogation room before grabbing the dossiers from the chest, this will lower the number of attackers and make freeing him easier. Once acquiring the Dossiers, going back up the stairs and hiding in the corner is recommended. This gives a good view of the Thalmor, and if swift action is taken, it is possible sneak attack the Thalmor at least once before spotting the player, possibly killing one (The 'Deadly Aim' sneak perk will almost ensure a kill, if caution is taken; the Slow Time shout can also be very useful) From there, use any means to defeat the Thalmor soldiers. However, once combat has begun, Malborn will begin fighting his aggressors, so without another target for the soldiers, he will most probably get killed
If he is kept alive during your escape, Malborn can be found in the New Gnisis Cornerclub in Windhelm. He says he wishes to escape to Morrowind, but believes the Thalmor have sent a Khajiit named J'datharr to assassinate him. If you kill J'datharr he will award the player 250 gold and leave Windhelm. When followed, he disappears when he reaches the Decree of Monument at Refugees' Rest, which means he has crossed the Skyrim-Morrowind border into Morrowind.
- Malborn will, most likely, be killed by a Frost Troll, Bandit, or Ice Wolf making his escape.
- Malborn dies quickly. This may also make him a good candidate for harvesting Bosmer blood for the Discerning the Transmundane quest, only after helping him escape to Morrowind is this recommended.
- A different NPC named Malborn can be found at the Dead Body Clean-up Cell, which can be teleported to by typing the command ""coc WIDeadBodyCleanupCell"" (PC only). This ""fake"" Malborn seems to exist solely if Roggvir survives his execution for too long. In this case, Roggvir will be moved to this Cleanup Cell to be killed by the ""fake.""
- Malborn (if he has survived,) will stay in the New Gnisis Corner Club in Windhelm, until J'datharr is killed.

"How to save on your Super Bowl bash
A little creativity and organization can make this your most economical party of the year.
Given that the cheapest available seat for Super Bowl XLVII is going for $1,580 on StubHub, watching the game on TV is definitely the frugal thing to do.
Not that the viewers at home won't be spending. The Retail Advertising and Marketing Association estimates we'll shell out $11 billion for one night of football. Some 5.1 million people even plan to buy a new TV just for the occasion. Retailers know this, and they're offering big-screen prices ""as good as we've ever seen,"" says Brent Shelton of FatWallet.
Don't forget the noshes, either. Last year we gulped an estimated 1.25 billion chicken wings (which I don't understand -- there's hardly any meat on them!) and 15,000 tons of chips. Factor in the pizza delivery, the burgers on the grill or the pigs in the blankets and you'll see how we spent $55 million on food and $237 million on soft drinks for Super Bowl XLVI.
That said, the Super Bowl can actually be a pretty cheap date. If you've got a decent-sized TV, comfortable seating and a bunch of friends who can be counted on to do what they're asked, this could be the most economical party you throw all year.
First order of business: Make logo gear optional. Seriously. Licensed jerseys and T-shirts are darned expensive, unless you luck into them at a yard sale or thrift store. Suggest that friends can show their allegiance by wearing their team's basic colors in some way, such as Ravens-black pants or a 49ers red hair scrunchie.
Timing has a lot to do with cost, so consider what time you want your bash to begin. Programming actually starts at 11 a.m. EST with ""Road to the Super Bowl,"" although kickoff isn't until 6:30 p.m. Even if you ask them to wait until the 2 p.m. start of ""The Super Bowl Today,"" that leaves plenty of time to eat and drink before the game even starts.
Either plan for lots of snacks or resign yourself to hosting an actual meal after the appetizers. Doesn't mean you have to cook it, though: Melissa Klein of celebrations.com suggests a Super Bowl potluck. You provide one or two main dishes (chili is cheap and always a favorite) and ask guests to bring their favorite party dishes.
Speaking of dishes: Klein also suggests using what you have, vs. spending on paper plates and disposable flatware. ""It might take longer to clean up,"" she says, ""but you will save cash and the environment.""
A variety of taste
Or you could do an all-appetizers buffet -- again, providing some nibbly bits and asking friends to bring their own favorites. No need to go broke filling people up, either:
- Buy corn tortillas from a warehouse store, dollar store or bakery outlet. Slice into strips and fry small batches in a couple of inches of oil until crispy. (Hot from the fryer, these things will vanish almost instantly. Get a lot of tortillas.)
- Open a can of diced tomatoes and peppers and add a little lime juice, fresh or dried cilantro, whole kernel corn and some black beans. Now you get to say, modestly, that you made the salsa and the chips yourself.
- Go beyond the usual Chex snack mix using flavor variations from iFoodTV.com -- surprising tastes like Asian, East Indian, caramel or peanut butter.
- Visit the Popcorn Board's recipes section to find tips on treats like Blazing Buffalo Ranch, Hot Mustard, Chili-Lime, Nacho Cheese and Lime Pickle. (Hint: Keep the beer cold.)
Something to drink with that?
Beverages may cost you as much as or more than food. A couple of frugal options are lemonade and homemade iced tea. Plan for a couple of gallons of each. Doctor a dollar-store lemonade mix by adding fresh lemon or lime juice, plus some pureed strawberries or raspberries.
If your friends want beer, let them bring it themselves. Ditto with harder stuff, although you could provide mixers (soft drinks will be big loss leaders in the days leading up to Super Bowl Sunday). Note: It is imperative to make sure no one drinks and drives. Either make sure there are designated drivers or let tipsy pals sleep over.
Since this is a long, long party, why not have something else to do during the pregame show or halftime? Weather permitting, an obvious choice is a pickup football game, says Jennifer Sellers of HowStuffWorks.com. Or have your guests bring their favorite songs for a lip-syncing contest, in honor of the ""live or faked?"" nature of the singing of the national anthem.
Donna Pilato of About.com suggests several games, too, such as don't say ""football,"" sports charades and a pigskin toss. (The last can be a foam football indoors if it's 10 degrees and snowing where you live.)
Prizes need not cost a lot, since people will compete hard even for a $5 coffeehouse gift card. For some, having won means as much as or more then scoring a free latte.
Readers: Are you having a Super Bowl party? Have any tips for keeping costs reasonable?

"PV for glass and steel11 / 2011, Research & Development | By: Sara Ver-Bruggen
Organic PV: Several developers of novel solar cells are teaming up with suppliers of building façade and envelope materials to turn buildings into renewable electricity generators. But why are these industrial players working with developers of solar cells that fall so far below acceptable efficiencies?
The mood at this year’s EU PVSEC was acutely sensitive as to what the next 12 months or so hold in store. But while the conventional photovoltaics industry prepares for a period of belt-tightening, other industries, specifically those that supply the global construction market, are turning to novel PV technologies as opportunities to add value to their product lines and enhance their future competitiveness.
Markets for building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) are significant. The glass and steel industries produce billions of square meters of products for construction markets every year, of which even a small percentage is worth pursuing by third-generation PV. This partly explains why an increasing number of glass, coated steel and other building façade component suppliers are working with developers of solar cell technologies wherever there is potential to closely integrate PV and building components.
Lars Pfeiffer of ThyssenKrupp Steel Europe says, “How conventional PV panels are produced is nothing like the manufacturing involved in processing building components, but when we start to look closely at how organic and polymer PV (OPV) are made, there are some similarities between coating and processing steel and solar cells.” Third-generation PV covers a wide range of materials engineered with semi-conducting properties at the molecular level. They include, but are not limited to, small organic molecule semiconductors, large molecule organic polymer semiconductors, metal nanoparticles, quantum dots and silicon nanostructures. Most R&D efforts are focused on OPV and dye solar cells (DSC). DSCs are based on nanoparticles of titanium dioxide covered with a molecular dye that absorbs light.
Third-generation photovoltaics are compatible with low-temperature processing. Clean room environments required for crystalline silicon (first-generation PV) and thin-film PV (second-generation) manufacturing are not required for third-generation PV fabrication. This expands production possibilities considerably. Some developers, like Oxford Photovoltaics in the UK, are working on screen-printing DSCs onto glass, whereas Heliatek in Dresden, Germany, is focused on vacuum processing OPV onto plastic with high-volume roll-to-roll equipment. Third-generation PV films and coatings, due to their potentially high light-absorption properties can be made nanometers thick, achieving modules with high-transparency levels, ideal for integration into windows and glazing. The use of low-cost, high-throughput printing and coating techniques means less energy is consumed during their manufacture, and capital investment in equipment is lower than that required for silicon-based devices and other thin-film technologies.
Moving out of silicon’s shadow
In spite of this, the situation in the current PV industry, which has developed around crystalline silicon which today accounts for 80 percent of the market, means all alternatives are measured against the performance of silicon modules. The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), ASTM International (American Society for Testing and Materials) and Underwriters Laboratories Inc. (UL) all publish standards for PV products and all are based around crystalline silicon. Standards for newer and third-generation PV technologies do not exist yet, but efforts have been focused on the efficiency and stability of OPV devices. To add to the challenge, many third-generation PV technologies are being developed for BIPV applications, so effective standards for rating performance characteristics will need to acknowledge the performance criteria placed on the building components they are integrated with. This is important because it means other industries will set the performance criteria for BIPV technologies. “The results of tests such as light soaking on OPV cells produced by Heliatek last year indicate the stability of the cells and their potential suitability for BIPV applications,” says Martin Pfeiffer, the start-up’s Chief Technology Officer.
Partners that Heliatek is working with to develop BIPV applications supply the building-glass and façade industries. Compared with other PV technologies, the key properties that make OPV suitable for certain BIPV applications include their light-weight, semi-transparency and outstanding low light performance,” says Chief Executive Officer Thibaud Le Séguillon. He adds, “We are working with a glass company on a potential application where OPV can be used also to produce a tinted glass as well as provide an energy-harvesting functionality.” As Le Séguillon points out, third-generation PV also outperform silicon in certain conditions, especially in low light and under cloudy skies and shade, which means they are suitable for sides of buildings, where silicon PV modules would generate less if illumination was too low. Like their thin-film cousins, third-generation PV also exhibit excellent mechanical robustness, which results in higher efficiencies in higher temperatures. Standards developed for third-generation PV would be able to take all of these characteristics into account, establishing a more diverse PV industry with different products suited for very diverse applications and environments. Konarka is contributing to BIPV standards development including the Fraunhofer Multi-element project, ISOS 1, 2 and 3 and IEC.
Increasingly, developers of third-generation PV are working with industrial partners, proving that the lower power conversion efficiencies of third-generation PV need not be a disadvantage for BIPV applications. Large buildings such as commercial offices, skyscrapers, industrial sheds and factories and plants have a lot of surface area. Depending on the building itself, PV modules that can be supplied with tinted glazing or a metal roof or façade do not need to operate at such high efficiencies. According to Swedish start-up NLAB, which is installing a pilot production line for making DSC glass modules, if its panels have an efficiency of five percent, they can generate 50 watts of electricity per square meter, so that a one square meter glass façade is enough to power one square meter of office space. Heliatek expects its first modules made from OPV on PET substrates to emerge from its pilot vacuum roll-coating equipment to reach efficiencies of between five and six percent.
There are other advantages too. Marc Thomas, President of DyeTec, a DSC glass venture between materials supplier and technology enabler Dyesol and Pilkington Glass North America (part of NSG), says, “The implication of BIPV was recognized quickly by the partners in DyeTec. Cost is already burned into the building, as the PV element is part of the material. In this application, you remove the cost of the glass processing for a conventional PV module and the cost of installation because you have to do it anyway.” ThyssenKrupp Steel Europe sees potential for taking Konarka’s OPV modules, produced like a plastic film on roll, and applying these to its steel façades.
Konarka led a press conference at the EU PVSEC to announce its new partnerships. The company’s co-founder Howard Berke is back in charge, steering the company out of a period of what could be described as the wilderness years, where it looked like bags for charging iPods threatened to be the commercial zenith of Konarka’s Power Plastic. As well as a new executive team, which includes James Buntaine who was previously CTO of Eastman Kodak’s organic LED (OLED) business, Konarka has new industrial collaborators. These include ThyssenKrupp Steel Europe, Bischoff Glastechnik, which has supplied glazing for prestigious buildings such as the Reichstag (German Parliament) in Berlin, Lapp Group, supplier of cables and connectors, and Fraunhofer Institute for Wind Energy and Energy System Technology, IWES. At the press conference Berke’s enthusiasm was palpable as he jumped up time and again to hand out sheets of film printed with organic solar cells to the audience, drawing upon the aesthetic qualities of the samples; solar modules as thin, flexible, near transparent plastic sheets for easy integration, in red, green and dark blue hues.
ThyssenKrupp Steel Europe is drawing up a joint development agreement (JDA) with Konarka, so ThyssenKrupp’s Lars Pfeiffer cannot go into much detail about the two companies’ collaboration. But the company says, “In 2012, pilots are planned with the view of commercialization occurring within a three-year time frame. The collaboration is focused on façade integration.” The Color/Construction unit of ThyssenKrupp Steel Europe is a leading supplier of steel construction elements. During the production of construction elements, steel strip is coil coated with films, paint or plastic coatings, in various combinations to provide protection and enhance the metal’s durability. These continuous coating lines could potentially be used to apply the OPV surface.
In its first phase the partnership will see Konarka deliver ThyssenKrupp its solar cell film, or foils, which will be cut and laminated onto the color coated steel element. The OPV film will be adhered to the steel element at the factory ready for delivery to the construction site.
Longer term there is the potential to produce the cells as part of the steel color coating process. Some details of this are being ironed out in the JDA.
Earlier this year ThyssenKrupp Steel introduced with Juwi Group construction elements featuring roof-parallel PV modules. The PV systems consist of solar modules installed on special, roof-parallel substructures. The substructure is matched to the roofing elements supplied by ThyssenKrupp Steel Europe. The systems are suitable for both single-skin roofs and roofs made of sandwich panels, which provide heat insulation.
The collaboration with Konarka will address façade elements, where aesthetic qualities of Konarka’s Power Plastic, such as the different colors, can be exploited. ThyssenKrupp’s façade products range considerably, depending on application and properties applied to the steel by coating and foil processes, from 20 euros to up to 200 euros per square meter.
Dyesol and Tata Steel, a leading supplier of color-coated steel in Europe, have been running an incubator facility for the past few years at Tata’s site in Shotton, Wales, to develop a roll-to-roll line that can produce cells on coated steel for making metal roofing on warehouses and industrial sheds, a market which is estimated by Dyesol to be worth over 100 billion pounds (GBP). The PV Accelerator, which is staffed by a team drawn from both Tata and Australia-headquartered Dyesol, is aiming to commercialize its BIPV steel roofing by 2015.
Over in the U.S., DyeTec recently installed pilot equipment at its facility in Toledo, Ohio. DyeTec’s BIPV program is funded by the Ohio Third Frontier Fund. In addition to shipping-specialized DSC equipment to DyeTec, Dyesol has also sent staff to Toledo so that DyeTec can begin developing large-size prototype DSC glass panels. The modules DyeTec will produce will be made of transparent conductive oxide (TCO) glass made by Pilkington and will be targeted at downstream suppliers in the glazing and façade market to produce DSC-TCO glass products for BIPV, BAPV and automotive integrated PV (AIPV) applications.
Despite the interest third-generation PV technologies are generating for BIPV applications, this is a technology that is only on the verge of finding its feet outside of the lab. The conventional PV industry is not going to pave the way for the commercial use of third-generation PV, but routes to market are being explored by OPV and DSC developers working with suppliers of components to the construction industry. The next few years will see these partnerships focus on exploiting compatibilities and synergies between third-generation PV production and coating, laminating and other industrial methods for processing building components. In this time, frame conditions for demand will emerge. Today, a handful of countries have introduced BIPV feed-in tariffs, but the real challenge is to make BIPV technologies commercially viable without subsidies. This will occur as we learn more about how much energy buildings consume, the cost of paying for this energy and how, supported by fit-for-purpose standards, BIPV can be a cost-effective solution.",en,web

"What species is Lucy and how does she relate to humans?
Lucy is an Australopithecus afarensis, a well documented group of early hominins. Fossil Australopithecines show evidence of bipedalism and generally have relatively small brain size and body stature. This species may be ancestral to later Australopithecus species and early Homo.
Does the small size of Lucy's brain mean she wasn't smart?
No! Lucy's brain size relative to body size is comparable to modern apes. Relative brain size is simply the size of the brain relative to the rest of the body. Brain size is not necessarily a diagnostic factor of intelligence. For example, Neanderthals had a larger body size than modern humans, which was an adaptation to colder climates. This means Neanderthals also had a larger brain size, but it doesn't mean they were more intelligent than modern humans.
How did Lucy become a fossil?
After Lucy died, her bones settled into dirt and rocks, called sediments. She then was buried by many more layers of sediments. The weight of all these layers of sediments crushed some of her bones. After a long time, the calcium in her bone was replaced with minerals from the surrounding soils. This process is called mineralization. It turns the bone into rock and preserves it for a long time.
How did Lucy move?
Lucy appears to have walked bipedally (on two legs) but also may have spent a lot of time in trees. Lucy arms are longer than her legs, which is characteristic of arboreal primates. Her finger and toe bones (phalanges) are curved like those seen in tree climbing (arboreal) hominins. But her hips and legs are more like bipedal hominins, such as modern humans, and the angle of her knee (valgus) suggests she walked upright on two legs.
What did Lucy eat?
Lucy probably ate fruits, plants, roots, seeds, insects, and possibly small animals. A combination of cusp patterns and lines that are left on the surface of the tooth when an animal eats can help scientists better understand an animal's diet.
Why is Lucy so famous?
Lucy is the best preserved and most complete specimen of A. afarensis. About 40% of the entire skeleton was recovered. Her fossil dates to about 3.2 mya. Scientists have answered many questions about bipedal evolution by looking at the part of Lucy's skeleton below her skull, also called the postcranial skeleton.
What sort of tools did Lucy use?
Stone tools have not been found at the same sites as A. afarensis fossils. However, this does not mean Lucy did not use tools. In fact, Lucy probably used tools made of wood or reed that did not preserve over the millions of years of weathering and burial. It is also possible that she used unworked rocks and wooden sticks as tools, just as modern chimpanzees use today.
How did Lucy get her name?
Her official name is AL 288-1, but Lucy got her famous nickname from the Beatle's song, ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds."" The people who found her were listening to this song the night she was found. Lucy was also named Dinkinesh by Johanson. In Amharic, an Ethiopian language, Dinkinesh means ""you are a beautiful, unique, special one.""
What is Lucy's geologic age?
Lucy is 3.2 million years old. Scientists arrived at this date by testing chemicals, called Potassium-Argon and Argon-Argon, in layers of volcanic ash above and below the rock layer where Lucy was found.
Did Lucy speak and if so, what language did she speak?
There is no evidence that Lucy had a spoken language, however, she may have been able to communicate in different forms. There is documented proof that primates communicate in a variety of ways such as using gestures, facial expressions and vocalizations. Humans communicate this way, too. For example, if you see a friend smile, it is interpreted as a sign of happiness.
How do scientists know Lucy is female?
Lucy's pelvis bone is similar in shape to that of a modern human female, and her fossilized skeleton is very small when compared to some other A. afarensis fossils. Lucy's size suggests that she belonged to a sexually dimorphic species, a species in which the males have larger body sizes than females.
What kind of family did Lucy have?
No one knows what kind of family Lucy had. Nearby the Hadar site where Lucy was found, anthropologists also found a group of at least 13 different A. afarensis individuals that were living about the same time as Lucy. This may be evidence that Lucy lived in a large family-like group.
Did Lucy have any children?
It is possible that Lucy had children, but no one knows for certain. Scientists usually look for marks on the symphyseal border of the female pubis bone for signs of childbirth. These marks, called parturition scars, look like pits on the surface of the pubis. Lucy does have some pitting on her pubis. Typically, the more pits, the more children the female had. But scientists are unable to tell how many children Lucy had.
How tall was Lucy?
Lucy was about 107 centimeters (3'6"") tall. A. afarensis were sexually dimorphic, meaning that males were larger than females. A male may have been over four feet tall.
When and where was Lucy found?
Lucy was discovered on November 24, 1974, in the Hadar Formation in the central Afar region of Ethiopia.
How do scientists know Lucy was an adult?
Lucy had fully erupted wisdom teeth (or third molars) and her bones appear fully fused. Bones form in separate pieces and fuse (connect) together, and teeth erupt at different times in life as an animal grows. By the age of 35, most humans have fully erupted third molars and fused bones.
How did Lucy die?
No one really knows how Lucy died. Her skeleton looks different than it did when she died because it has been crushed by sediments for millions of years and then turned into a fossil. (See also ""Did Lucy have any injuries, such as broken bones?"")
Did Lucy have any injuries, such as broken bones?
Scientists are not certain about any injuries Lucy might have had before she died. Her skeleton looks different than it did when she died because it has been crushed by sediments for millions of years and then turned into a fossil. (See also ""How did Lucy die?"")
What type of house did Lucy live in?
Lucy didn't live in a house like modern humans. Instead, Lucy most likely spent the night in trees or in caves.
What kind of habitat did Lucy live in?
Geologists have determined that Lucy lived around a large lake surrounded by trees. This would have provided easy access to water, plants and prey animals.
Who found Lucy?
Lucy was found by Donald Johanson and Tom Gray.
Is evolution a fact or a theory?
Both! The genetic change over time in organisms, known as biological evolution, is an observable fact which can absolutely be observed in both living organisms and in the fossil record. The ""theory of evolution"" refers to the evolutionary mechanisms that may affect change within a population. A scientific theory is a hypothesis that has been tested to the extend that the observed results are reliably predictable and therefore considered true.
What is the difference between relative brain size and absolute brain size?
Absolute brain size is the actual size of the brain. Relative brain size is the size of the brain compared to the size of the entire body. Both absolute and relative brain size can help anthropologists differentiate between species.
What is natural selection?
One of the processes that must occur for evolution to exist is natural selection. Between individuals in a species there are always variations in the genetic material. Sometimes these variations give certain individuals a better chance at survival. The greater number of offspring from one individual, the greater the chance of changing the genetic structure of the population. After many generations, these small changes can add up to make an obvious difference. It has been proposed that these processes can lead to adaptation and eventually a new species over time.
What is adaptation?
An adaptation is a characteristic with a specific function that enables an organism to live in its environment and successfully reproduce. Adaptation is also a process in which organisms adjust to their environment. Selection pressure is the force that shapes specific adaptations. Adaptation is viewed as a response to problems set by the environment, and an adaptation can be morphological (i.e. physical) or behavioral.
What is gene flow?
Gene flow is the transfer of genes from one population to another within a single species.
Did humans come from monkeys?
No. All species are related to one another because they share genetic material inherited from a common ancestor, though some species are more closely related than others. For example, human and chimpanzees share over 98% of the same genetic material. Based on this fact, we can safely say humans and chimps shared a recent common ancestor that had ape-like morphology. This does not mean humans came from modern apes because apes living today also have evolved over millions of years since splitting from the last common ancestor with humans. The molecular data tells us that this ancestor lived between 5 and 7 million years ago. Another way to look at it, humans share nearly 85% of their DNA with mice. Eomaia scansoria was the last known common ancestor of both mice and humans and lived between 75 and 125 million years ago.
What is mutation?
Mutation occurs when changes are made to the genetic material. This can occur due to a copying error during DNA replication, or exposure to radiation, chemicals, or viruses. Mutation is typically random.
What is genetic drift?
Genetic drift is the accidental shift in allele frequencies in a population. It is caused by random chance as some individuals in a population leave behind a few more offspring than others. Its effects are most dramatic in small populations. The founder effect, an example of genetic drift, is seen in populations derived from a small sample of individuals who do not represent the genetic variation seen in the parent population. Genetic drift does not produce adaptations.
What is evolution?
Evolution is the process of change over time. Rocks, cars, computers, humans- everything changes over time. So when someone asks, ""What is evolution?"" the real question is ""What is biological evolution?""
Biological evolution is descent with modification through genetic inheritance, i.e. parents pass along genetic traits to their offspring. Most importantly, biological evolution is a population process. Individuals are subject to selection and adaptation; populations evolve. Evolution may result in a new species or changes in an existing species. There are four mechanisms that act upon evolution: natural selection, random mutation, genetic drift, and gene flow. (More information on evolution can be found in the ""What is Evolution?"" teaching module.)
What materials make up bone?
Bone is made up of both organic and inorganic components. Protein collagen provides the flexibility of bones while the mineral components of bones are mostly hydroxyapatites, formed primarily of calcium and phosphorus. Small amounts of sodium, magnesium, fluorides, and carbonates are also present. One-third of living bone is water.
What is a fossil?
A fossil is any anatomical evidence of past life. There are many different types of fossils, including body fossils where part(s) of the skeleton is preserved; trace fossils that preserve evidence of behavior such as footprints; and extraordinary fossils where soft tissues, such as skin, are preserved. Different types of processes are involved in the formation of different types of fossils.
What is a species?
A species is a group of interbreeding or potentially interbreeding organisms capable of producing fertile offspring. All offspring inherit genetic material from their parents, with individuals experiencing genetic mutations that make them slightly different from their parents. New species form when a population (i.e. daughter population) experiences genetic change due to environmental or genetic factors that inhibits successful reproduction with members of the ancestral (i.e. parent) population. This is commonly referred to as a speciation event. In cases where the species is extinct and known only from the fossil record, scientists can classify the fossil into a species based on traits that make fossil specimens unique from one another. In more recent years, scientists have used DNA analysis to differentiate between species.
Why do you use the term ""hominin"" while other anthropologists use the term ""hominid""?
Both terms are most commonly used to describe a group that includes humans and our bipedal fossil relatives. The term hominid reflects a classification that groups humans and their bipedal fossil relatives in the family Hominidea to the exclusion of apes who are placed in the families Hylobatidae (gibbon and siamang) and Pongidae (orangutan, chimpanzee, bonobo and gorilla). The term hominin reflects a classification that groups humans and chimpanzees in the subfamily homininae and separates humans and their close fossil relatives into a separate tribe, the Hominini. Since the molecular data clearly shows a close genetic relationship between humans and chimpanzees, it is more appropriate to use the term hominin when discussing human evolution.
Do men and women have different numbers of ribs?
No. Most adult men and women have 12 pairs of ribs. However, there is variation in this number and some people may have an extra pair of ribs or an extra vertebra.

"About a former Kite family slave
From the March 21, 1933 issue of the PN&C (Article from the “Home of the Birds” column written by Jacob R. Seekford)
Devotion to an Old Negro Mammy
About 135 years ago, George Kite lived in the big brick house that now stands half way between Alma and Honeyville on the east side of the road now owned by William Martin. By Mr. Kite’s first marriage was born three daughters and three sons: Hiram Kite, who went West; Noah Kite who was drowned in the flood of 1870; Hardy Kite who was found dead in a piney field about a mile southeast of Alma. After Mr. Kite lost his first wife, he married again and because of family differences, he divided his large estate here and moved to near the Rapidan river, not far from Graves’ mill, buying property there. In the same brick house, Siram Kite and Charlie Kite and James Kite were born. They were by the second marriage. In a little log house, which stood near the big brick house, was born a hundred and thirty-two years ago a little negro baby girl. She was the slave girl of old George Kite when Mr. Kite moved from Page county. He took the colored women with him. She had nursed all of the Kite children. When she was set free she never left the Kite home.
Thirty-five years ago I went over to Charlie Kite’s place to move a large store building for him. I went on the porch and noticed a little room screened in. I wondered what it was for and looked in through the screen. In there was the most pitiful sight that I had ever beheld. There was an old woman with a snow white head. Her eyes reminded me of the eyes of a large black spider. This old woman had been in this little cage for six long years. No kind of an insect could get to her. The Kite family fed her with a spoon as she had no use of her limbs. I have seen Mr. Kite go to the spring and dip up fresh water and hold it to the old woman’s lips for her to drink. I have seen him take water and a towel and wash her face and hands. I finished up the job and came home. Later I went back to Mr. Kite’s stayed all night and left just as the sun peeped over the hills. This old human spider had passed into the great beyond.
Three Old Men Weep at Her Funeral
Siram Kite lived about six miles away from and Jim Kite lived about two miles but it wasn’t long before they arrived at the Charlie Kite home. In the meantime the old woman had been washed, dressed and laid out. I saw those old men stand around that old woman and cry like children. When the coffin came in she was placed in it. I saw on the top in a silver plate, the word ‘Mother.’ That night, those three old men, with Howard Lillard and Geo. Lillard sat up and watched the lifeless body of this old woman. They sat and talked of her useful life. I would like to be there when this old woman and sits in God’s golden witness chair and tells of her life that she spent around old Honeyville and Alma and on the banks of the old Rapidan. I was there lead to believe that there is a power in man that cannot be controlled.",en,books

"First things . . . Richard Falknor on 01 Apr 2011 08:51 am
“Boehner said he is glad that [Tea Party] activists remain involved. But he cautioned that Republicans control just ‘one-half of one-third of the government here in Washington, we can’t impose our will on another body, we can’t impose our will on the Senate.’” — Newsmax report
“The Republican Party acts as if it is without recourse. Republican administrations — with the exception of a brief eight-year respite under Ronald Reagan — more or less remain on the glide path set by Franklin Roosevelt and the New Deal.” – Mark Levin in 2009. (Underscoring Forum’s.)
Hugh Hewitt’s transcript of his interview with Mark Steyn dated yesterday illuminates the serious problem that conservatives face in trying to achieve their goals through the current Republican leadership.
But before we highlight some of Steyn’s and Hewitt’s more telling exchanges, let’s revisit the forward edge of battle this Friday morning.
The House GOP leadership has apparently made avoiding “shutdown,” the boundary of their effort to shape Federal outlays for the balance of this fiscal year. The leadership’s too-many uncritical followers in the “conservative” blogosphere have echoed this “goal.”
The House GOP leadership has (artfully) changed the subject from not stopping Obamacare. What the public sees is the fog of offers and counter-offers for very modest first steps to cut the deficit.
Faithful readers know that knowledgeable conservative voices and analysts have addressed the so-called shutdown (a slowdown as Heritage calls it) issue. Last week former Senate Steering Committee general counsel Michael Hammond’s “Where This Is Headed” (RedState) explained an alternative strategy. Heritage Distinguished Fellow (and former long-time U.S. Representative from Oklahoma) Ernest Istook raised unanswered questions (by the GOP House leadership) in his “Untouchable. That’s the treatment being given to the $23.6 billion being spent right now to implement Obamacare.” (Underscoring Forum’s.)
The Current House GOP Team
The problem Tea Partyers and the conservative grass roots always faced just before (and after) last November 2 was getting the House GOP leadership team to be aggressive advocates of a smaller-government agenda.
After all, the Speaker had helped engineer and vote for the No Child Left Behind legislation. Both the Speaker and current Majority Leader Eric Cantor had voted for the entitlement-ballooning Medicare Prescription Drug Act. This was long before their voting for the TARP legislation in the waning days of the George W. Bush presidency.
How can politicians with such a voting background, politicians who flourished in the political culture of former Speaker Dennis Hastert’s House of Representatives, politicians who never renounced this larger-government voting record, effectively carry out the expectations of both the House GOP freshman as well as the core of veteran conservatives in that body?
But let’s look at this week’s Hewitt-Steyn exchange:
“MS [Mark Steyn]: ‘No, I think you’re right. I think that they [a lot of the Republicans in the Congress] think, they look on November as a hissy fit, and that it’s, one is occasionally obliged to string along with the more intemperate members of one’s base. But once the election’s safely in the bag, it’s back to business as usual. And that’s the danger. I think that is the danger here. I like, I mean, I like what Rubio said yesterday, and I like what Mike Pence said. But they all should be talking like that. And someone, you know, even Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe ought to be talking like that. This is an existential crisis for the United States of America. The debt ceiling, I mean, in a sense, there are no good answers to that question. If we don’t approve the raising of the debt ceiling, then we’re telling the world that the superpower is on the brink of defaulting, and that will end the dollar as a global currency. But if we do just raise the debt ceiling in business as usual terms, then we’re also telling the world that we’re fundamentally unserious about getting control of this insane level of spending. So the extremists here, the extremists are the guys who are not recognizing the reality of the situation. It has nothing to do with mid-century. It has nothing to do with 2030. It’s nothing to do with 2020. The consequences of this irresponsible and in fact wicked behavior are going to kick in long before 2020.‘”
“MS [Mark Steyn]: ‘For example, your EPA suggestion is a good one, because one of the things the Republicans ought to be fundamentally committed to is the restoration of responsible government in this republic, where laws are made by legislators accountable to citizens, which means we roll back regulation, and we constrain agencies who have grown far too used to legislating on their own, regardless of how the legislature votes, or how the voters vote. And so something like that actually lays down, it’s not important, particularly, in terms of the budget for 2011, but it lays down a marker. It says that this is who we are as a party. We believe in responsible government, we believe in a land where the laws are made by legislators accountable to the citizens. And that, things like that are worth doing, and they’re worth compromising on $10 or $15 billion, or whatever here and there, but they’ve got to be talking in those, they’ve got to be framing the debate in those terms. Otherwise, it’s just the usual nickel and dime, Washington deal-making, reach across the aisle-y stuff that everybody loathes. Everybody loathes.’”
“HH [Hugh Hewitt]: ‘And I do not, correct me if you’ve heard someone talking in those terms. I have yet to hear any Republican leader talk in those terms of markers and principle.’”
“MS [Mark Steyn] ‘I think this is going to be one of those things where you want to think how your vote [for any so-called compromise package that comes out of the leadership] is going to look two to four to six to eight years down the road. And this is going to be one of those, I think you’re right, that this is going to be one of those issues that defines who you are, and whether you understand where the United States is at this moment in history.‘ (Underscoring Forum’s throughout.)
Read the entire Hewitt-Steyn exchange here
Can the House freshman and the core of veteran conservatives in that body — with the help of grass-roots conservatives around the nation — bring the GOP leadership to an awareness of what courageous steps must be taken right away in this budget battle?
For, as Mark Steyn points out, the stakes are vastly higher than whether the old media and the “sophisticated Beltway types” will blame Mr. Boehner and Mr. Cantor for “shutting down the government.”",en,web

For Immediate Release
MOST FLOODPRONE BUILDINGS IN THE COUNTY TO BE TORN DOWN
Charlotte, North Carolina – The often-flooded Cavalier Apartments will be bought by Mecklenburg County and torn down. This all but eliminates the chance of flood insurance dollars or tax money being spent to rescue people or repair damages from a future flood. Property owner Cavalier Associates, LP, and the Mecklenburg Board of County Commissioners have agreed to a sale price of $6,590,000. Commissioners formally approved the purchase at the Board's March 18 meeting.
The total cost of the project is estimated to be $9.6 million:
- $6.6 million to purchase the buildings and land
- $3 million for demolition and tenant relocation
Sources of funding:
- Department of Homeland Security/Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Grant: $5.4 million (55% of total project cost)
- Charlotte-Mecklenburg Storm Water Fees: $4.2 million (45% of total project cost)
Cavalier Apartments buyout facts:
- Located at 550 Bramlet Road
- 192 apartments on nearly 13 acres of land in the regulated floodplain
- Northern bank of Briar Creek between Independence Boulevard and Monroe Road
- Built in 1971 before restrictions on building in floodplains
- Significant flood losses occurred in 1995, 1997 and 2003
- Negotiations took more than 14 months.
Benefits of the buyout:
- Permanently reduce the threat of loss of life or personal property due to flooding
- Save money on flood insurance claims and emergency response services
- End the problem of temporarily housing more than 100 families after each flood event
Mecklenburg County will take ownership at closing, which is expected in 60 days. In compliance with the federal Uniform Relocation Act, qualifying residents of the apartments will be given a one-time payment to help with moving expenses and higher rental costs for comparable housing. Storm Water Services staff is currently holding meetings with residents to explain the process. Demolition is expected to begin in late 2008.
As the site is cleared, County staff will hold public meetings and planning workshops to help determine the future use of the 13 acres of open space. Possible uses of the land might include a greenway, water quality features such as wetlands and rain gardens, recreational opportunities, or a combination. The Board of County Commissioners ultimately will decide what to do with the site along Briar Creek.
County Storm Water Services Division Director Dave Canaan says buying the property will save public money in the long run. ""It's cheaper for the government to get people and buildings out of harm's way than it is to issue disaster checks after repeated, severe floods,"" he says. He notes that detailed benefit/cost analysis was required as part of the grant application and approval. ""If the apartments remained, future flood damages would cost four times more than we're spending to buy and demolish them now,"" Canaan says.
The cost savings does not include money spent on emergency evacuations by Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police and Charlotte Fire Departments, or the cost to the Red Cross and other groups who house and feed flood victims. Past rescue and emergency assistance costs associated with flooding at the Cavalier Apartments have cost several hundred thousand dollars. ""This is another win-win,"" says Canaan. ""The federal government will no longer pay flood damage claims for Cavalier, local emergency response personnel can focus on other priorities during a flood, and the community gets an additional 13 acres of land for public use.""
Money for the buyouts comes from a combination of FEMA grants and local (storm water fee) funds. FEMA's Pre-Disaster Mitigation Program provides grants for mitigation, which FEMA defines as ""reducing the long-term risk of loss of life and property by lessening the impact of disasters."" For the Cavalier acquisition, Storm Water Services received technical support from the North Carolina Division of Emergency Management.
Since 2000, Charlotte-Mecklenburg Storm Water Services has purchased 160-floodprone buildings.
Buildings acquired through this program have been torn down and the floodplain has been returned to a more natural and beneficial state.",en,reference

Many who grew up with 'snail mail' ready to let go
SEAL BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- The death of Saturday mail delivery would seem to have the biggest impact in places such as Leisure World, where residents -- many in their 80s and 90s -- grew up with the mailbox as their connection to the rest of the world.
But many people just don't care in the Southern California community where life slowly revolves around golf, card games and splashing in a heated pool.
Now there's email for letter-writing and Facebook for keeping in touch with friends and relatives. And there's snail mail for ... Well, for what, really?
""All we get anymore are bills,"" laughed Leisure World resident Albert Rodriguez, 83, a retired bus driver whose wife, Gladys, quickly corrected him.
""We also get junk mail,"" she added with a smile.
Some older people might remember the days of waiting anxiously for the Sears catalog or Saturday Evening Post to land in their mailbox. But those days died long before the U.S. Postal Service announcement this week that it plans to kill Saturday deliveries except for packages.
Many of the 9,000 people who live at Leisure World, a seaside village in the suburbs of Los Angeles, have no problem with forgoing bills until Monday.
Sure, the change might require putting checks in the mail a bit sooner to pay those bills, but that shouldn't be a problem for a generation brought up to pay its debts on time.
In days gone by, waiting for the mail was a happy ritual for many, especially when they were expecting a new catalog touting the latest fashions.
""Oh my God, my grandma depended on those,"" said 77-year-old Lynette Waltner, adding the Lane Bryant catalog was the favorite of her grandmother.
Like many seniors, Waltner still pays her bills by snail mail because she doesn't trust online transactions. She doesn't email much either, and she's decided Facebook is a big waste of time.
But the idea of waiting around on a Saturday to see if an important letter might actually arrive? Forget about it.

My HP laptop finally died after ~3.5 years of use. During its short lifetime, it's hinges died twice (second time was fatal), the battery died twice, the power adapter died twice, the display died once, and the system had to be ""recovered"" numerous times. I can't say I was real sad to see it go. My usual strategy for replacing a laptop has been to get something good but not state of the art. However, this strategy has resulted in laptops being replaced every 3-4 years, on average (a Compaq, a Dell, a Sony, and a HP) as they became unbearably slow. A relatively new phenomenon in laptops is the ""gaming"" laptop. Although I don't play computer games, these laptops are designed for fast performance under demanding conditions. Asus has come out with some reasonably-priced gaming laptops that seem well-built, so I went for one. It is an amazing machine that has helped increase my productivity a lot. If you are considering replacing your laptop and are a power user, please see my review.

Hugh Ross, president and founder of Reasons To Believe, has published an updated, third edition of Beyond the Cosmos, originally published in 1996. Beyond the Cosmos is based upon biblical theology and the scientific theories about string theory and extra dimensions of space and time.

Earth looks old
Several years ago one of the young earth creation ministries wrote an article about how the author thought the earth looked young. At the time I thought it was pretty non-persuasive. As a youth, I can recall always thinking that the earth looked really old to me. Even though I grew up in the suburbs of Los Angeles, we did lots of hiking and traveling throughout the mountains and national parks of the Western States. Living in the shadows of the 10,000 foot high San Gabriel Mountains, they didn't look young to me. When I finally got back to the East Coast, what impressed me was how rounded and eroded the Appalachian Mountains looked compared to the San Gabriels. I thought they must be really old. Turns out they are. Yes, they look old. However, some recent trips have really impressed me about how the earth looks really old. Hence, I have finally taken the time to write this page. More...

"About a week and a half ago I was sitting in my living room ogling over my bikes. I had just gotten home from my friend, Johnny's, house. He was generous enough to kick down some bike parts he had been collecting, and wasn't using. Sitting in front of an aluminum road frame I hope to build(if I ever make the time) I heard the screech of car tires.
As many folks know, Visual Resistance started the NYC Ghost Bike project, so the first thing that flashed thru my head was, ""holy shit, there's going to be a ghost bike in front of my house.""
Impulsively I grabbed my camera, ran downstairs to document what happened. For me photographing an event like this comes from a sense that a ""victim"" may need visual documentation of injuries, location, license plates, police officer's identification, etc. It's less of the sick voyeur or objective documentor.
When I got outside there was already a crowd around the intersection and some people above the body on the ground. I still thought he was dead. Thankfully a bystander knew how to handle trauma situations and coordinated people until the ambulance came.
Coincidentally, waiting on the corner was a friend of the cyclist who had just been struck. The two were to meet up at this intersection and then go work on their bikes. Instead he took a car service to the emergency room where his friend, Shino, was treated for head injuries, broken bones, and gashes.
The driver, who thankfully stopped, was arrested for a suspended license. Its strange, for me, because I had empathy for him too. He was clearly remorsful and upset about what happened. When I was taking photographs, he was standing there too. He had seen the pool of blood below the cyclists head, the shoes that were ripped off his feet from impact, and the destroyed BMX bike. With all of my hatred and frustration with car culture, in this instance I couldn't blame this driver. I hold him accountable for being the cause of this accident. Although I wasn't as angry as I envision myself to react.
Drivers infuriate me. Cars parked in bike lanes, double parked on narrow streets, drivers distracted, talking on cellphones, aggressive maneuvers to go around other cars and cyclists, piss me off. Driving while intoxicated, and the deaths that have occured are unexcusable. What I'm conflicted with is how to hold people accountable. In accidents regarding bicyclists, the city government virtually ignores the rights of a cyclist. Rarely are motorists charged or convicted of wrongdoing. Sending people to jail, for accidents, doesn't appear to be a solution, to me, in most situtations. It may acknowledge the humanity of the particular cyclist, but not the greater attitude of motorists toward bikes.
One of the things I hope the Ghost Bike Project, with the memorial rides, is capable of doing, is create a greater consciousness of cyclists. Of the right to ride bikes on NYC streets, that they are entitled to space on the street. That motorists need to share that space, and the City needs to provide more infrastructure to ensure the safety of those that choose to ride a bicycle.
Off the soapbox now.
The day after getting out of the hospital, Shino called me. He heard that I had taken pictures and he'd like to get them. He wanted to write a story about the accident for his
Upon seeing him I couldn't help but think he was a ghost. His eye blood-red and a brace on his wrist. He was going for surgery the next day. I gave him the disc of fotos and told him I was grateful there was no need for a white bicycle at the intersection. He agreed.
You can check out his story ""Life is Twisted"" with the photos at Grindstate. The site layout may be a bit confusing for some, so fool around a bit. Its the first story up there.
Last, I want to ask everyone that drives a car, ""look out for cyclists!""
Colin Matthes recently completed a mural for Milwaukee's IN:SITE temporary public art program. The mural is titled ""Everyday Transactions: The Familiar Inconceivable"". The mural draws upon elements of the everyday, and reflects much of what occurs- business, warfare, and leisure. Water plays an important role in this mural. Water simultaneously connects us and divides the space. With talk of global warming, tropical storms, and the increasing scarcity of water in poor countries we are asked to question our relationship to water, as well as our relationship to each other in the world around us.
IN:SITE has been providing resources and opportunities to create temporary public art in Milwaukee since the fall of 2006. In that time a number of wonderful projects have been created such as:
This most recent round of projects also includes:
•“Phyto Remedy” by Benjamin Martinkus
•“Through 30 Steps Backward” by Mike Genovese
•“Flight” by Darryl Jensen
•“Urban Radio Network” by Bridget Quinn and Jessica Vandevort
•“PARK(ing)” by Rosheen Styczinski
and many more...

"With ears that can be bent and shaped, rick-rack “whiskers” and fluffy little tails, these buckets, our latest Let’s Make Something Together project, are sure to be a hit with even the Easter bunny himself!
This project is one I completed a few weeks back over at SYTYC for the Just Scraps challenge. With the exception of two small supplies, each and every element I used to create these little guys was something I had used in the competition’s previous challenges! In case you missed it, here is part of my writeup about them from that week’s post…
Quilting Cotton Fabric (for lining)
Washable Ink Pen
Assorted Fabric Scraps
Iron-On Vinyl (Black)
Embroidery Needle and Floss (optional)
Basic Sewing Supplies: Machine, Shears, etc.
Cut out all of your pattern pieces, and connect the different sections of your main bucket pattern according to the instructions on the PDFs. Once your patterns are prepared, cut out the pieces for you bucket:
1 canvas main bucket piece
1 canvas bucket bottom piece
1 fusible fleece main bucket piece
1 lining fabric main bucket piece
1 lining fabric bucket bottom piece
4 canvas outer ears
2 fusible fleece outer ears
2 patterned fabric inner ears (fuse this fabric to your fusible web before cutting your pieces out)
1 strap piece – Large Bucket: 6 x 18 inches; Small Bucket: 4 x 12 inches
Note: All seam allowances are 1/4″, unless otherwise specified.
step 1 / Fold your strap piece in half lengthwise; press. Fold each of the long edges up to your pressed center line so they meet in the middle as shown; press. Fold your piece in half again; press.
step 2 / Edgestitch along each of the long edges of your pressed strap piece. If desired, stitch a series of lines in the center of your piece for a decorative touch. On your large strap piece, you will stitch 4 additional lines that are each 1/4″ apart. On your small strap piece, you will stitch 2 additional lines that are each 1/4″ apart. Set your finished strap piece aside.
step 3 / Iron the fusible fleece to your main bucket canvas piece and your bucket bottom piece according to the product directions. Fold your assembled piece in half, right sides facing, so that the short edges are aligned. Stitch along this short edge. Stitch your lining fabric piece in the same manner.
step 4 / Pin your bucket bottom piece to the narrower opening of your stitched main bucket piece, with the fleece side of your bottom and main bucket pieces facing out, as shown. Carefully stitch these pieces together. Repeat with your lining bottom piece and your stitched lining main bucket piece.
step 5 / Turn your bucket right-side out, and pinch the outside edges so that the back seam is exactly centered with the front of your bucket. Make marks with your washable ink marker at each of these outer side creases, as well as at the point directly opposite the back seam. Center one end of your strap piece over each of the side marks you just created, looping the strap down and around the bottom of your bucket. Baste your strap pieces to your bucket piece, and remove your pins. (This will make stitching the lining and main pieces together much easier!)
step 6 / With your canvas main bucket piece right-side out and your lining piece wrong-side out, slide your canvas piece inside your lining piece, as shown. Pin these pieces together along their aligned upper edges. Stitch together, leaving a 3-inch opening for turning. Turn your bucket right-side out through this opening.
step 7 / Carefully press the joining seam you just stitched, and pin the opening closed. Edgestitch along the upper edge of your bucket, closing the opening as you go.
step 8 / Iron your fusible fleece outer ears to the back of two of your canvas outer ear pieces. Fuse your inner ear piece on top of this piece, as shown. Stack this assembled piece on top of another of your plain canvas outer ear pieces, and pin together. Edgestitch along the outer edge of these stacked pieces to attach them to one another, leaving the bottom edge open.
step 9 / Tuck a piece of craft wire (3.5″ for the large bucket, 3″ for the small bucket) up through the bottom opening of one of your ear pieces, so the end of the wire piece is about 1 1/4 inches from the bottom of your ear piece. Stitch a rectangle to encase your wire to prevent it from shifting around. Fold the bottom edges of your piece toward the center, as shown, and baste to secure these folds. Pin your piece to the inside of the front of your bucket, using the center front mark you made in step 5 as a guide for placement. Stitch a small rectangle shape to attach your ear to your bucket.
step 10 / Iron fusible Peltex to the back of your scrap fabric pieces, and cut various patches out to embellish your bucket. (I cut a square for one of my bunny’s eyes, and one for behind the tail, as well as a triangle nose piece.) If desired, embellish these pieces with embroidery floss. Cut two eyes and a mouth shape from your iron-on vinyl. Use hot glue to affix your eye patch and tail patch pieces to your bucket. Iron your vinyl eye and mouth pieces to the front of your bucket. Hot glue your nose piece above your mouth piece. Finish by affixing rick-rack whiskers on either side of your nose piece with hot glue and a pom-pom tail to the back of your bucket.
Have a terrific week!",en,reference

"In addition to the Microsoft Office coming to iOS, there are other signs that Windows Phone 7 is not going to enjoy a long and thriving life. One of them is Intel’s plan to conquer the ARM processors market. Neither Intel nor Microsoft can longer ignore the flourishing market of ARM-based devices. So Intel is going to make ARM chips and Microsoft will make Windows 8 run on ARM-based systems. When they talk ARM devices, it’s not just tablets and netbooks. They explicitly meant smartphones too!
Let me state this again:
- Intel is going to produce ARM chips that are going to be effective enough for smartphones;
- Microsoft is going to make their next version of Windows run on Intel’s ARM chips;
- This combination is going to power smartphones in the future.
While this is a good thing overall (more hardware and software for smartphones to choose from), it’s a death sentence for WP7. If an ARM version of Windows 8 runs on Intel chip based smartphones, nobody will need the current stack of hardware and software known as Windows Phone 7.",en,web

Barmey Frank throws in the towel: admits that the GOP will keep the House
Today’s surprise announcement by Barney Frank that he will NOT run for re-election in 2012 is important because it is the first overt admission that the Democrats will NOT retake the House next year.

Just wondering, if your preferred candidate were to drop out, who would be your choice for the nomination?
Some time in the near future, the GOP presidential field will start to thin itself out. Results from the early primaries, difficulty in raising more money…whatever the reason(s)…politics is Darwinian…. This is NOT to suggest that any candidate should, or will drop out of the race.

"As a powerful mix of weather converged on the U.S. East Coast, residents across the region seemed to take the warnings with varying degrees of seriousness.
""It started yesterday afternoon when we started to see a rush from consumers for supplies like flashlights, hand-held radios and batteries,"" said Tom Collins Jr., a hardware store owner in Atlantic County, New Jersey. ""And starting this morning, we've started selling plywood to contractors to help board up homes.""
In Manhattan, where forecasts of a direct hit from Hurricane Irene last year left the city largely unaffected, many residents seemed relatively confident about Hurricane Sandy and its aftereffects.
""Most seem to take the attitude of 'whatever happens, happens,'"" said Jason Covell, who works at Nuthouse Hardware on Manhattan's East Side. ""I don't think anybody's going crazy and buying sandbags.""
Still, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Friday declared a state of emergency in every county in expectation of the storm, while placing the National Guard on standby.
Mayor Michael Bloomberg said the city's Metropolitan Transportation Authority would begin suspending service ""before the arrival of sustained winds of 39 miles per hour or higher.""
""A major concern given this type of storm is the possibility of prolonged power outages, as you know,"" he said.
As Sandy churned northward, forecasters warned of high winds, strong tides and heavy rain, as well as potential snow, saying the storm would be strengthened by its collision with a wintry storm moving from the west.
Early forecasting models show the tropical weather could make landfall in the Washington region as early as Monday, though it will more likely push farther north and slam the New York metropolitan area by Tuesday.
Eastern portions of Ohio and Pennsylvania could get snow, while heavy rains are expected to blast the Eastern Seaboard.",en,web
"As I sat on the subway on my way to work the other day, there was a group of 'kids' (I feel weird saying that) talking and laughing awkwardly. I eavesdropped enough to pick up on the fact that they were college freshman who were in that fittingly awkward getting-to-know you phase of orientation. I laughed to myself as I watched and listened to them, clearly uncomfortable, one-upping each other with stories of badass high school parties, crazy nightclubs, and that time that they got caught by their parents. Part of me wanted to tell them that rather than being so uncomfortable, they might as well loosen up now, because they would eventually anyhow, and why waste time being anxious? My more cynical side wondered who would still be friends after four years, who would be eaten alive by New York City, and who had already decided that these were not the people that they wanted to be friends with. And then, just for fun, I wondered which girl was the sluttiest, which guy might be ashamed of going to college a virgin, who was lying about their past and if anyone was standing there with a smile, but secretly wanting to cry. Come to think of it, it's no wonder freshmen drink so much.",en,books
"Center for Inflammatory Bowel Disease Treatment and Research
Corticosteroids (Prednisone, Prednisolone)
Generic Names: prednisone, methylprednisolone
Brand Names: Solu-medrol, Medrol, Deltasone, Orapred
Drug Class: Corticosteroid
What do these medications do?
Corticosteroids are used to treat patients with active Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis. Corticosteroids decrease inflammation in the lining of the intestine by suppressing the activity of the immune system. These medications are effective in treating about 80% of patients with Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, and patients will typically experience a reduction of symptoms within 1-2 weeks. Because of the potential for long term side effects, corticosteroids are usually given at full dose for a short period of time, and then the dose is gradually reduced.
What are the side effects?
Most side effects of corticosteroid use are temporary and resolve once you/your child stops taking this medication. The effects are variable from patient to patient. The most common side effects include:
- Weight gain
- Puffy cheeks
- Mood disturbances
- Sleep disturbances
Less common side effects include acne, stretch marks, or hair growth. Rare side effects of corticosteroids include stomach ulcers, headaches, or cataracts. Because corticosteroids suppress the activity of the immune system, they can also increase the risk that patients will have complications of certain infections, especially viral infections like chicken pox or mononucleosis (mono)*. However, most patients taking corticosteroids have no problem managing routine illnesses, including colds, earache, or strep throat.
Long-term use of corticosteroids can lead to decreased growth and bone thinning, which can cause an increased fracture risk and/or hip pain. For this reason, physicians typically prescribe them on a short term basis to get the inflammation under control quickly during times of disease flare.
You should never stop taking corticosteroids abruptly! Your doctor will discuss how to gradually taper your dose over many days. This gradual reduction will prevent a serious side effect known as adrenal insufficiency. Taking steroids affects the adrenal gland’s ability to produce a hormone known as cortisol which helps your body deal with physical stress. Therefore, you should tell your doctor or emergency personnel if you/your child needs surgery or is involved in an accident because you may need a stress dose of steroids.
*You should report fever or any signs of infection to your doctor immediately.
How to take your medication and miscellaneous facts:
- Corticosteroids can be given by mouth or through the vein (IV).
- You should take this medication at the same time everyday, preferably in the morning if taken once a day.
- You should take this medication with food to reduce GI upset. • While taking this medication, you may also need to take an antacid medication to help prevent stomach ulcers.
- If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember.
- Check with your doctor or nurse practitioner before starting any new medications, herbs, or vitamins while taking this medication.",en,reference

"An Alabama man has been charged with the death of his 2-year-old son.
The Hamilton County Prosecutor’s Office said Micah William Harrison, 30, of Robertsdale, Ala., used a kitchen knife and nail puller to kill his 2-year-old son, Michael Harrison, also of Robertsdale. Micah is currently detained at the Hamilton County Jail.
Noblesville police officers responded to the report of a stabbing in the area of 14924 Waterlily Dr., Apt. 14, at 4:45 p.m. last Wednesday. Patrolman Jason McDermott was the first officer on the scene. He came in contact with Micah outside of the apartment and observed what appeared to be blood on his hands. After Micah was detained, several officers entered the apartment where the victim’s grandmother, Pamela Harrison, led them to the spare bedroom.
NPD Det. Michael Sadler said Michael was found lying on the floor between the dresser and TV stand with multiple wounds on his chest and forehead.
“Each wound was bloody and appeared to be consistent with a stab,” he wrote in the probable cause affidavit. “Officers found that the body was cold to the touch and was pale.”
Efforts from police officers and medics to save the toddler were unsuccessful.
“There was significant trauma to the head,” NPD Spokesman Lt. Bruce Barnes said.
Officers were told that Micah drove to Noblesville from his Alabama residence on Jan. 8 with his three children. The child’s mother did not accompany them on the trip. Barnes said her exact whereabouts were not known as of publication time, but she was believed to be in the southern United States.
“We don’t know the relationship between the mother and father,” he said.
Pamela told police officers that Micah said someone or something was trying to kill him. She also observed him attack a utility closet door with a claw hammer prior to the fatal incident.
Pamela told police she observed Micah moving quickly from the kitchen to the other bedroom where she knew Michael was playing. She went into that room and saw Micah on top of Michael, who was lying on the floor.
“Pamela observed Micah stab Michael two to three times with a kitchen knife,” according to the probable cause affidavit.
Pamela took the knife from Micah, placed it on the dresser and called 911.
“Officers further observed splatters of blood on the beds, walls, furniture and ceiling in the spare bedroom,” Sadler said. “Also on the top of the dresser, officers found a nail puller, which was a tool with a shape that appeared to be consistent with the forehead injury.”",en,web

"Home Sous Vide equipment
Home Sous Vide-ing received a huge write up in our local paper the other day. Apparently, there is a marketing move to get home Sous Vide equipment into the kitchen.
I don't know about this -- I really lack counter space for not only the sous vide machine and a vacuum sealer, I also lack the motivation to cook my boiled eggs for 12 hours.
SO...do you want one? Have one? See the need for one? Going to get one? (All for home use, of course) Are the results THAT spectacular to make this worth the effort?
I became interested in sous vide a couple of years ago, and therefore experimented with cheaper ways of low temperature long term cooking and.... Yeah. I could do it. Sort of. The primary draw backs were that I live in an all electric house, and even though using a HUGE stock pot on a low setting on my ceramic electric cook top would hold a fairly low (but not exact) temperature, it kicked my electric bill up a notch or two I did not appreicate. So I bought an electricity sipping induction hot plate. It will cook low and slow BUT it takes about two years of experimentation to figure out the difference between 120F and 140F, and by then I'd be happier with peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for dinner!
More thought. What about one of those thermostat thingies and a crock pot for exact temperature? Give me a break! Who needs all of that jerry-rigged clutter for two or three days while you're waiting for something to turn into dinner? Okay. If I wanted to sous vide, at this juncture in time there is only one compact, leave it on the counter top or put it on a shelf option, and that's the Souse Vide Supreme. I went for the full size model simply because I don't trust aluminum not to discolor over time. The full size is all stainless.
What do I think of sous vide cooking? Well, all of the interest and recipes floating around remind me of the early days of microwaves. In many quarters, insanity reigns! Sous vide is NOT an ""only method"" way of cooking. It is a TOOL! I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE sous vide eggs! Mushroom and truffle rissotto topped with a couple of sous vide eggs is my new go to comfort food. Steaks sous vide, then charred by sizzling frying pan, blow torch or charcoal are fantastic! Sous vide pot roast or brisket? Been there, done that, gave away the tee shirt. I can do MUCH better and MUCH faster with my pressure cooker or even in the oven if I want to wait a long time. I've read recipes by people who swear that sous vide custards are fantastic. hmmm... Sous vide creme anglaise maybe, but custard or flan? I doubt it. But maybe I'll give it a shot sometime. LOL! If that works, maybe I'll work my way up to sous vide Quiche Lorraine. Suuuuure I will!
Bottom line is, if you're well versed in the majority of cooking techniques, they will continue to serve you well and you can keep four hundred bucks safely tucked in your savings account. On the other hand, if you LOOOOOOOOVE a great medium rare steak... Have fun! '-)
Well at this point I'm just trying to figure out if the overall ""sous vide thing"" should have a place in my kitchen at all ... ergo the experimentation. I ""blew the $11"" today at home depot and got the lamp dimmer switch. As you are reading this, I've got the crockpot set to WARM (@ 100% = 180/181) and the switch set to ""about 1/3 or so"". I poured water in at about 140 and will wait about an hour to see what it stabilizes at and mark it accordingly. This will cost me about 8.5 cents. We shall see ...
What I'm more interested in for later tonight is waiting for my beef to finish it's marinade so that I can put the strips into the dehydrator for my very first homemade beef jerky . ..
Cool. I just picked up a crock pot (marked down by $5 at Target, so bully for me). I then rationalized getting a PID controller from Auber. Mainly b/c I can also use it for my home-built cold smoker, which generates smoke with a hot plate and pan of wood chips. I have other controllers that I could modify or program to run it, but I don't really need another project right now to build that.
The eggs are the thing that has vexed me. I finally looked at Lucky Peach again and told myself I had to do it.
i have a stainless steel bowl that i use on the smallest burner (reserved for sauces) on the stove. if i fill it up 90% of the way, and set the heat to the lowest setting, it keeps the water somewhere between 130-135, precisely the temperature i want it at. no additional equipment needed at all.
perhaps you should invest in a thermometer and give it a whirl.
I have a Sous Vide Demi. Bought it was their site around Xmas when it was on sale for $199..
Been having a lot of fun with it. Use it along with my FoodSaver for vacuuming. Over at EGullet there is a wealth of information about Sous Viding. I see others have posted about using crockpots etc.., but my sous vide machine keeps the temp with .5 degrees. Cooking at lower temperatures for long periods of time can be a safety hazard. Do a lot of reading on this.
What I like is that you can buy the cheaper cuts of meats and they come out extremely tender and you don't lose the flavor of the meat. Last night I cooked Turkey Drumsticks. Very flavorful.
You do have to brown your meats afterwards to make them look appealing.
We have always bought the loin pork chops from Costco and always found them tough. Sous Vide they are very tender, moist and flavorful.
You can cook your meat, then cool it down quickly in ice water, until completely cool ,then freeze it. When reheating you just bring your sous vide machine to the temp that you cooked it at and it will not cook further but just heat througfh. It is so nice be able to have cocktails and not have to be in the kitchen waiting to remove the meat from an oven or it will overcook.
It is great to be able to cook things way ahead and just reheat and they taste like that have just been cooked...not like leftovers.
It takes practice. I cooked a piece of lamb too long and it came out with a mushy texture that we didn't like. I write down everything I cook and that way next time a do a cook I can look to see how it came out previously and adjust, if necessary.
If you like to experiment I am sure you will love Sous Videing.
Hi Slanted. Interesting but not currently an option. My electric range is terrible - it will boil water on warm. And my portable butane stoves won't have quite the fine control for the extended timeframes that will be needed. I bought a 36 thermador cooktop that will be able to pull this off, but that won't get installed until we redo the kitchen this year.
SV produces some really nice results, as well as some techniques that aren't possible with other methods. It's not exactly necessary for a home cook who's just trying to get delicious food on the table - there are always other ways. But it's nice if you're into it. I cook SV often - at least once a week for the last few years. I find it especially useful for dinner parties that are larger than my kitchen can easily manage because it allows me to shift workload towards prep. I also use it in cooking competitions, where it has some major advantages.
Think of it as something like buying a dedicated smoker: it can get expensive; it's not strictly necessary; but it's for hobbyists and if you're into it, SV can produce some damn good eating.
ETA: eggs take an hour and 20 minutes. Unless they're ostrich eggs.
I'm just starting to experiment a bit with sous vide. I honestly don't see a point to buying a dedicated piece of gear to do it, since I already own a 6 quart ""cook n carry' crockpot. And I also own four large 48 quart coolers.
To start with, I'll be playing around with the crockpot, since it already has a heating element. I can always later on get one of those sous vide kits, pre-made or self-constructed, if I really need or want to do a BIG batch of stuff using a cooler.
So test #1. Pork shoulder. Why? Well I have made a LOT of pulled pork, so I know what my traditional results are, using a crock pot and using an oven. This way, I have a pretty good gauge of good normal low and slow end results against my ""sous vide"" experiments.
Seems easy enough, right? Just put boneless pieces into a ziplock bag, 3/4 fill the crockpot with warm water, toss into the crockpot on low and wait. Did it work? No - not really. My first experiment was ""edible but a failure"" vs. . The end results would have been better if the pork was simply done normally. The pork was perfectly edible and fell apart but lacked the normally interesting results that I get when I simply use the crockpot without my adaptations.
The problem? Even on low, the crock pot gets WAY too hot for sous vide. The water reached about 205-208. Even on WARM, it stabilized at 180-181. Again too darn hot. Ok - lesson learned.
So, being an engineer by trade, I've been reading ... and reading ... and there are lots of ways to adapt a crockpot to be a low-cost sous-vide platform.
My next step, for under $10, will be to get a dimmer switch - to limit the inbound current. Since the crockpot has very little draw - about 1.5 amps, so a dimmer that can handle 2.5 or more amps should be perfectly safe. This way, I can do some experimenting with my digital thermometer, and put some marks on the dimmer so that I can reliably set to water to 130, 140, 145, or whatever I want.
This is what I'll try next, and we'll see how it goes. If I get get a few really successfulsuccessful, then I can always figure out if I'll leave well enough alone or grow things using digital temperature controller or PID or immersion heater or whatever. There are a lot of ways that it can be done. And pretty much all of them are a lot less than $300 or so for a dedicated small appliance.
Wish me luck!
Boy that sure sounds like a pretty good deal. Is that still available or was it some sort of special promotion/sale? Do you have a link to share?
And thanks for the compliment but it's really not a big deal. It's really just hooking up a lamp dimmer switch to a small appliance. There isn't any splicing, cutting or tape involved at all. You're giving me way too much credit. :-)
To me, doing some experimentation just isn't a big deal. For a mere $10, I'll get to have a 6 quart ""starter"" system, and can figure out how cool this sous vide stuff might really be - and how it might fit into our lives. I would just rather not have one more dedicated appliance around unless it is a ""need to have"" or gets regular use.
If the results are really spectacular and I need to have a ""larger machine"" then a sous vide kit for my cooler would be a great way to go.
""My next step, for under $10, will be to get a dimmer switch - to limit the inbound current. Since the crockpot has very little draw - about 1.5 amps, so a dimmer that can handle 2.5 or more amps should be perfectly safe.""
Frankly, JK, you'll have an easier time just using a very large stockpot full of water on the stove and frequently spotchecking with a thermometer. I've done this for sous vide preparations of up to 24 hours. It can be surprisingly accurate. Of course, it requires a big stockpot.
Using a dimmer switch on a crockpot, it will take the bath forever and a day to stabilize, and you'll have to keep on checking it until it has acheived a basic form of stabilization (reliably gaining or losing x degrees in y hours). With a large stockpot, you can get a bath reasonably well stabilized in under an hour and a half, and close enough to cook with in under 20 minutes.
>> Using a dimmer switch on a crockpot, it will take the bath forever and a day to stabilize, and you'll have to keep on checking it until it has acheived a basic form of stabilization (reliably gaining or losing x degrees in y hours).
You could well be right but for $10, what the heck ... :-) I got the idea from stuff like this: http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-hack-a-Crockpot/step3/Yes-youre-actually-done/.
But instead of doing the wire cutting / splicing thing (I can do stuff like this readily enough but I'd rather not have a Frankenstein thing in my kitchen. So, these things look ok: http://www.amazon.com/Leviton-TBI03-1...
I figure that if I start with say 4 quarts of hot tap water (it's about 120-125), that it won't be all that tough for the crockpot to get it up to 140 or whatever and then maintain it accordingly.
Anyway, it's only $10 and will help keep me out of trouble and away from the crack house ... :-)
I recently purchased the Sous Vide Demi (cutleryandmore had the best price, by far, free shipping) - and have been slowly easing our way into the world of sous vide.
So far, we have made duck breasts which came fantastic. Then we made sous vide coq au vin, which truly was as good if not better than any coq au vin I have ever had!
There are several features of cooking sous vide that make it worthwhile. 1. No moisture escape - the food is vacuum sealed, so it aint going anywhere...your poultry/lamb/etc is left ridiculously juicy and tender. 2. the temperature you set is what the meat is throughout. Not like on the grill or pan, where the center is perfect surrounded by rings of more ""done"" - one temperature/color throughout the piece, end to end. 3. although very possible, it is difficult to overcook...set the temp, throw your packages in the water and get to it when you are ready.
Overall, we love it...and we are just getting started with it! Chicken breast cooked sous vide will help seal the deal. There is a reason why sous vide is an integral part of Thomas Keller's cuisine.
Also, I recommend the Rival vacuum sealer....works just as well as the more expensive ones. And I like the bag rolls, where I can cut to what size I prefer.",en,web

"HARTSVILLE, S.C. – The Coker College men's volleyball team will hold its first-ever home match on Thursday, and the ceremonial first serve will come from Alton Bryant.
""I am so excited to give back to the organization that has given so much to me,"" Bryant said. ""Also being able to represent veterans at Coker College is a great honor.""
Bryant is a senior business major in the Adult Learners Program for Higher Achievement program at Coker College. He is a 24-year veteran of the United States Army. Bryant retired from active duty as a Sergeant First Class in 2004 and resides in Columbia, S.C., where he serves as a diesel mechanic instructor at Fort Jackson.
""We are very pleased that Alton has accepted our invitation to give the first serve,"" vice president of athletics and facilities Lynn Griffin said. ""Having a veteran kick off our men's volleyball program is such an honor for our college and the athletic department.""
The Cobras will be looking for their first win in program history Thursday when they take on Pfeiffer University at 7 p.m. The match is a 'CobraFANatics' event, so fans are encouraged to wear yellow.
Coker College readies undergraduates for personal and professional success through a distinctive four-year program that emphasizes a practical application of the liberal arts as well as hands-on and discussion-based learning within and beyond the classroom. Coker is ranked among the ""Best Colleges"" in the South by U.S. News & World Report as well as The Princeton Review. Located in Hartsville, S.C., Coker is within two hours of the cultural, financial and recreational resources of Charlotte, Columbia, Charleston and Myrtle Beach.",en,web
"But ""Enchanted""? ""Enchanted"" was a movie I'd heard so much about. Unless you live under a rock, as I sometimes do, you probably already know that ""Enchanted"" is revisionist Disney, a sort-of satire where The House The Mouse Built pokes gentle fun at some of its most spectacular successes: Princess stumbles out of cartoonland into New York City where she meets a modern prince, a divorced divorce lawyer complete with cute daughter. Mice clean the house, birds land on extended fingers, people occasionally break into song.
I'm not sure what I expected, but I know I expected to enjoy it more than I did. I think part of the problem, like with a lot of movies, is that each scene is 30-60 seconds too long. Then, too, a good part of the movie is prologue and then - boom! - you feel like you're close to the end. But I find that all movies, even the bad ones - and this was by no means a bad movie, just not as good as I expected - make me think about something. Sometimes it's about writing, since the story arc of enjoyable fiction often mimics or shares the structure of film. Sometimes it's about life itself.
So what am I thinking now? I'm thinking about the concept of Prince Charming, the promise of lasting romance (for realism's sake, we'll skip Happily Ever After). Is the idea of loving one person forever a fantasy? Is the idea of Prince Charming in general damaging to women? Am I just reaching for questions here because it's Sunday, I need to write this blog, and now I'm starting to ramble???
I don't know the answer to any of that, but here's your QUESTION OF THE DAY: WHAT MOVIES HAVE YOU SEEN LATELY AND WERE THEY ANY GOOD? OH, AND YOU CAN ALSO ANSWER ANY OF MY QUESTIONS FROM THE PRINCE CHARMING PARAGRAPH ABOVE.
I'll tell you one thing I do know: More people should just spontaneously break into song.
A belated Hanukkah if that's your holiday, a Merry Christmas or Kwanzaa if yours is yet to come, if you're atheist I hope you enjoy every day and don't find the rest of us too annoying, and a Happy New Year to all.
Oh, and SECRETS OF MY SUBURBAN LIFE will go on sale January 8, so if anyone/everyone wants to ensure I have a great holiday season...

"You guys. SERIOUSLY. Thanks for all of the fantastic comments/emails/votes regarding Hair Thursday. Of course, the lazy side of me is all DAMN YOU AND YOUR NEEDS, but the Sally Fields in me is repeating “You like me! You really like me!”
(And of course, the conceited boob in me is screaming I TOLD YOU SO.)
So, we’ll keep things as is for now. I do think, unfortunately for some, I’m going to start sorting through the requests and finding new dilemmas to address. One of the main reasons I feel bogged down is the plethora of requests from long-haired people who still want long hair. THERE ARE ONLY SO MANY PHOTOS OF SIDESWEPT BANGS AND LONG LAYERS, PEOPLE.
(Hey! That’s why I added the Hair Length, Type and Color search section in the sidebar. Be sure to use it if you are wanting a subtle change and are looking for photos!)
(Oh! One more thing. I am still going to do two participants on Thursdays, but will separate into two posts, so they will be easier to find with the search feature.)
So, let’s get on with it. Meet Joey.
Brown hair with subtle natural highlights
Fine, very straight
No preference for length and wants a change. (Yes!)
Usually spends around 5 minutes on hair, but will spend more if needed.
Owns a flat iron and hot rollers
Uses no products besides shampoo and conditioner
Wants to quit wearing ponytails all the time
Joey is open to shorter hairstyles, but wants to make sure she can pin the front out of her face, since she works in a lab. Joey has super straight and fine hair, which is perfect for shorter haircuts that some of us thick and wavy gals can’t pull off without a lot of maintenance.
Let’s look at two options.
Option #1 is a very sleek, chin-length bob with heavy texturizing. With Joey’s straight hair, she wouldn’t need to spend a lot of time using a flat iron, and she could pull the sides back for work. Option #2 is a much more casual style – sideswept bangs, layering all around, and texturized ends. I really like this style for Joey’s face shape, and she would only need to blow dry her bangs, add a little styling pomade or wax to the back for definition and she would be out the door. Plus, the bangs would look cute pinned to the side with a bobby pin while at work.
I also think the reddish brown shade in Option #2 would be a lovely color for Joey.

"Eliot Spitzer, who spent a lifetime in public office condemning wrongdoers, got lucky Thursday with the decision by federal prosecutors to not charge him with a crime for his role in a prostitution ring.
The former governor, who thought one day he could become president, has been sweating since March that he would be charged for patronizing a prostitution ring. His allies -- and there are not many of those left -- say Spitzer, who was brought down from office by the scandal, already was punished, and is still being punished, for his sexual dalliances.
Prosecutors were clear they found nothing illegal in how Spitzer paid for the services. There was no money laundering and no campaign funds were used.
The public statement from the U.S. Attorney's office did not say why it did not use the Mann Act -- a law making it a crime to cross state borders to engage in acts of prostitution -- to go after Spitzer.
Michael Garcia, the top federal prosecutor in the Justice Department's Southern District in New York City, said simply that the ""public interest would not be further advanced"" by charging Spitzer with a crime.
Will Spitzer, who talked at the time of his March resignation of someday trying to get involved with some higher cause, return in any way to a visible public scene, such as through some charitable work? Or is he destined to use his law degree and credentials to keep working out of his wealthy father's real estate development company?

"Many felt that the Jaguars would draft a defensive end early in the 2011 draft to help bolster a pass rush that lacked the speed and strength necessary to slow down AFC South quarterbacks Matt Schaub and Peyton Manning. However, when the draft came to a close the Jaguars were without a single new defensive lineman added to their team. In fact, there wasn’t even a linebacker added to the team.
So the new assumption by many has been that they would address their pass rushing woes with veteran free agency, similar to the way they did in the 2010 offseason when they signed Aaron Kampman. But to find a defensive end that would have an “every downs” impact, the Jaguars would have to sign a certain type of elite player and couldn’t go bargain shopping.
For the Jaguars to acquire a player that could make a true impact right away in 2011, why not look at signing a completely healthy player that had a Pro Bowl year in his last season? Better yet, he did so by tallying 12.5 sacks while playing in the AFC South. Gene Smith could continue the improvement of the Jaguars roster by signing Titans DE Jason Babin.
Coming out of college, Babin was a highly touted, All-American player from Western Michigan that went on to be drafted in the first round. The Texans, who had drafted CB Dunta Robinson with the 10th overall selection, essentially traded away the rest of their draft to acquire another first round pick to select Babin 27th overall.
Babin played three seasons with the Texans, tallying four sacks in each of his first two seasons and five more in his third season. With one season left on his rookie contract, though, the Texans traded Babin to Seattle in exchange for safety Michael Boulware.
Babin’s time with the Seahawks was disasterous as he couldn’t work himself into Seattle’s rotation at defensive end. In his first season with the Seahawks, Babin found the field in just two games and was unable to record any stats. He was released two games into the following seasons where he stayed without a team until the Chiefs signed him in November to fill an empty roster spot.
In seven games with the Chiefs, Babin started four and recorded two sacks before becoming a free agent. He was then signed by the Eagles for the 2009 season where he was unable to find a starting spot, but was able to earn 2.5 sacks in 12 games that he found the field.
The Titans signed Babin for the 2010 season and his skills finally bloomed to the potential that the Texans saw when they drafted him in 2004. He started all 16 games for the Titans racking up 12.5 sacks and two forced fumbles, ultimately landing himself in the Pro Bowl.
After a pinball career that has had Babin with five teams in his seven years in the NFL, Babin is now looking for some job security, saying that he is willing to sacrifice money to have more years on a contract. Even with the franchise tag paying over $12 million to defensive ends, Babin has said he isn’t interested and hoped the Titans wouldn’t use it on him.
Gene Smith has signed very few free agents during his tenure as general manager for the Jaguars so finding patterns in the signings is difficult. However, in his two offseasons of veteran free agency, there has yet to have been a signing of a player with just one great year of play. Torry Holt, Tra Thomas, Aaron Kampman and Kassim Osgood all came to the Jaguars after multiple seasons of top quality play in the NFL.
Perhaps the risk would be worth taking for Smith to acquire the player that was ranked #85 in NFL Network’s top 100 players of 2011 countdown. Or maybe Smith will instead look at Babin’s 4.5 sacks in the three season prior and decide to pass on Babin.
Babin’s career in the NFL has been a mediocre one except one stellar season in 2011. At 31 years old, Babin could certainly have more elite seasons like that, but could also go the rest of his career without even approaching double digit sacks again. Signing Babin would, without a doubt, be a risky move for Smith.",en,unknown

CINCINNATI -- Talks have been ongoing with Reds first-round Draft pick Mike Leake but appear to be nearing the home stretch.Leake, a pitcher, was the eighth overall selection by Cincinnati in the 2009 First-Year Player Draft. ""We've had several discussions lately,"" Reds general manager Walt Jocketty said. ""I think we're getting closer. Hopefully, we'll get something resolved this week. We've only got 10 days."" Last year, the Reds didn't sign their top pick, first baseman Yonder Alonso, until about 15 minutes before the deadline. ""I hope it doesn't take that long,"" Jocketty said. If Leake is signed this week, he would get almost a month of exposure in the Minor Leagues, most likely with Class A Sarasota. Any unsigned player after the deadline will automatically go back into the Draft pool, which means the Reds would receive a compensatory pick the following year in the same slot where Leake was picked. Leake, a right-handed starter from Arizona State, was 16-1 with a 1.71 ERA, 24 walks and 162 strikeouts in 19 games this season. A key member of the Sun Devils' run in the College World Series, he pitched 142 innings.
The deadline to sign Draft picks is 12:01 a.m. on Aug. 18.

2 Questions from the Community
I see the Kohler 1.28 gallon/flush toilet tank is same price as the 1.6 gallon/flush tank. Any reason why not to go with the lower usage tank? Pros and Cons?
A. Low flow toilets are greatly recommended for people who are on well water (instead of being plumbed into a city grid) or for people in places experiencing water shortages. Low toilets work great but have a tendency to clog a little easier than toilets that use more water. That extra bit of water regular toilets use create more flushing power.
Does the toilet tank come with the trip lever & which one is it or do we need to order one?

"The Rays have definitely shown interest in Jeremy Hermida, while a report Tuesday also linked him to the Reds and Braves.
Reds President of Baseball Operations Walt Jocketty said he hadn’t spoken with the Marlins lately but admitted he was searching for outfielders after dealing Ryan Freel to the Orioles for catcher Ramon
Right fielder Jay Bruce could move to center full time to make room for Hermida but Jocketty said he preferred to keep Bruce in right.
After trading away Adam Dunn and Ken Griffey Jr. last summer, the Reds need to acquire multiple outfielders to pair with the impressive young Bruce.
Young Reds pitcher Johnny Cueto likely remains off limits, a rival scout said, but the Marlins could ask for recently acquired RHP Micah Owings (the ex-Diamondback) or fading prospect Homer Bailey, who was once deemed untouchable by Cincinnati’s former front office.
""Nothing is close,"" Jocketty said of his search for outfield help.
If the Rays make a push for Hermida, they will have to give up more than swingman Edwin Jackson, according to a source familiar with the Marlins’ demands. Right-hander Andy Sonnanstine would interest the Marlins after winning 13 games last year, but the Rays will first exhaust several other offensive options (Milton Bradley, Jason Giambi, Bobby Abreu) before turning to their cross-state rivals.
The Braves may have inquired about Hermida but not as a replacement for Jeff Francoeur. Rather, they might have popped him in left field, and maybe only as a platoon option, but indications were that mood had already passed.
As for Jorge Cantu, there were indications the Giants may have cooled on the idea as they reportedly expressed interest in ex-Marlin Mike Lowell.
The Red Sox probably would deal Lowell if they were able to sign first baseman Mark Teixeira, along with C.C. Sabathia the hottest commodity in free agency.
The Twins have had internal discussions about Cantu but with Justin Morneau at first they have concerns about the health of Cantu’s throwing arm.",en,web

Even more Gotye madness! This song's been out for well over a year now, and I still hear it fairly constantly on the radio. Fortunately the BreakfastToms have made a video to show how we really feel when it comes on. Guilt. Annoyance. Excitement. All of these things combine to make a fantastic portrayal of our reactions.
Highlights for me included the ""feels so rrrrRUFF;"" the mumbling through various words of the chorus; and the ""ahh, ahh, ahh"" of the backing vocals during the second chorus. You'll understand what I mean when you see it. The beginning starts a little slow, but boy oh boy, is the payoff worth it.
Saturday, July 28
Hmm...that title makes this sound kind of Inception-esque...well, it's not at all. It's just The Key of Awesome! doing a parody of Walk Off the Earth's excellent cover of Gotye's ""Somebody That I Used to Know."" You know, that one where five people are playing one guitar?
Anyway, TKoA's parody is pretty spot-on. Lots of gems in this one, my personal favorite being the ""plinky noise"" and Tony just wandering away. You'll have to watch the video to find out what I'm talking about. What a teaser!

Have you ever imagined what a movie about Twitter would be like? Not at all? OK, how about after The Social Network? Now there's some curiosity, eh? Still no? Well...they made a trailer about a Twitter movie anyway!
Called You Got Retweeted, I sincerely doubt this will develop into a big thing. But they at least got some fairly big names to star in the trailer. Alison Brie, Jason Ritter, Daniel Franzese and Kimmy Gatewood come together in a fairly entertaining (albeit, completely stupid) romp where hashtags and @mentions are a thing of beauty. Fantastic.
One of the (originally) unique features about Twitter is (was) the hashtag. No doubt you've seen them now on all sorts of platforms, ranging from useful: ""Hey, is anyone else going to see #IcePrincess?"" to just ways to add something at the end of a sentence, without hitting the spacebar: ""I just went back for sixths at Golden Corral #cantwaittohavethismassivediarrhealattack.""
Regardless, Paul the Trombonist has decided to give us a little musical history of the hashtag. Pretty cool stuff. Check it out!

Let's be real, here. Nick Offerman, from Parks and Recreation, is awesome. He's a man's man, and as such, is often doing very manly things, such as operating power saws and whatnot. From time to time, the folks over at Team Coco like to have him read tweets from female celebrities, as well. And the results, as expected, are pretty dang funny.
This also makes me quite sad that some of these are actual tweets. But it's still far better than what I come across on a day to day basis. FAR better.
Sometimes people make supercuts that are ridiculous. This is a prime example of one such video. Wait a minute...virtually every supercut video is ridiculous...
Well, in any case, this one's pretty entertaining. In honor of The Dark Knight Rises, it's a bunch of people, from Community's Abed to Lady Gaga, saying some variant of the phrase ""I'm Batman."" Of course, clips from actual Batman movies and shows are in there, too. My personal favorite is the one that I believe is from Robot Chicken - the one that's taking place in the backseat of a car.

This video came out about a month ago, and I saw it about a week later. But I'm stupid, so I didn't decide to post it until right now. Oops. Anyway, it's a pretty hilarious video of people using the Shake Weight in public. It confuses a lot of passersby, which is always entertaining. I've used one of these things before. They're kind of awkward and bulky, and they make noise for some reason, but they do give a fairly good workout, so kudos for that.

This is just incredible. In honor of me not doing a RtP for nearly a month (I will get back to it soon, I promise!), here's a girl who does the voices/sound effects/yells/whatever you want to call it for all of the 151 original Pokemon. Every. Single. One. From the incredibly odd sound Victreebel makes to the soothing ""let me put you to sleep"" Jigglypuff, it's absolutely fantastic, and it seems like a lot of these are spot on. I seriously can't get over how impressive this is. Check it out!

Yesterday you may recall a post on more parodies of Carly Rae Jepsen's ""Call Me Maybe."" Of course, that is not the end of it. There's more. And there will always be more until the end of time.
In this case, it's the mascots of the Big 10 (well, now, 12...although only about four are prevalent in here) performing to the song. It's not bad by any means, but...I mean, we GET it. This song is catchy.
Tuesday, July 10
Look, I love Carly Rae Jepsen's ""Call Me Maybe"" as much as anyone. But when you start getting parodies like these...I think it's time to put it to rest.
The first is Cookie Monster singing about, well, what else? Cookies. It's called ""Share It Maybe,"" and takes place in an office. And it's delightful, but the CM's voice is just really irritating whilst singing. Too bad.
The second one gets points for its adorable video, but the ""singing"" leaves much to be desired. Maybe because it's just a corgi barking periodically along with the beat of the song. But the music video is pretty much the same thing as the actual song, which is absolutely fantastic. The ""twist"" at the end is especially awesome.
Sunday, July 8
This is incredibly clever and makes me want to go back and search for old family videos to see if I could pull off something similar. Maybe. MAYBE WE CAN!!! If that's not a teaser I don't know what is.
Watch this dude, Jeremiah McDonald, as he interviews his 12-year-old self about everything and anything under the sun. Well, I guess the most obscure reference is to Dr. Who. Either way, this is really entertaining and worth checking out. So do it!
Goodness, it's been a minute since we posted. And there probably will still be some transitionary phases. Moving is hard!
Anyways, today we see Ariel Winter (from Modern Family) as a live-action Dora in some kind of College Humor Dora, The Explorer movie trailer. And it's fairly entertaining. I personally like the ""the Swiper's right behind you!"" and Dora still not knowing where he is. Channeled some Blues Clues memories for me, personally. That's always a winner.

It's been four years since The Offspring's last record, 2008's Rise and Fall, Rage and Grace. So you could certainly say some days have gone by before they started working on their 9th full-length disc, the aptly titled Days Gone By. I wasn't sure what to think about this record after the first two singles: ""Days Go By"" could easily be a b-side from a Foo Fighters album, and while I find ""Cruising California (Bumpin' In My Trunk)"" infectiously catchy, it wasn't obvious that the whole CD could be held up by that kind of music. It's clearly a joke song, so how many would there be on the record?
It turns out, not many. The Offspring for the most part take a serious tone with this album, and it's great. There are a few slow moments, but otherwise this is a very solid rock album. Let's track-by-track it:
1) ""The Future Is Now"" - This one has been compared quite a bit to Rise Against. I can definitely see the similarities to ""Savior,"" specifically, but that doesn't make it a bad song. It's got the requisite energy to kick off the record, and even has a nifty piano breakdown near the end. 4/5
2) ""Secrets From the Underground"" - Another mid-tempo rocker, SFTU (which, now that I abbreviate it, looks dangerously close to abridged profanity) could certainly fit right in on Smash or Ixnay on the Hombre. That chorus is pretty catchy. 4/5
3) ""Days Go By"" - This was the lead single for the album, and like I said, it seems like it could fit right in on a Foo Fighters album. While that's not necessarily a terrible thing, this is possibly the most generic song on the whole disc. Which of course makes it perfect to ride the airwaves. 3/5
4) ""Turning Into You"" - Another Rise Against ""ripoff"" (at least according to some, this time it sounds like ""Ready to Fall"") marks the 4th track of the record. I actually really like the drum machine in the beginning and end, and ""Ready to Fall"" is a really good song, so if this rips it off, it picked a good one to borrow from. 4.5/5
5) ""Hurting as One"" - The chorus in particular is reminiscent of earlier Offspring, most notably ""Something to Believe In"" off of Smash. Again, this is not a bad thing by any means, and since there are only two really fast songs on this album, ""Hurting as One"" gets brownie points for being one of them. 4.5/5
6) ""Cruising California (Bumpin' In My Trunk)"" - Possibly the most polarizing song The Offspring have ever written. People really hate this song. There's no other way around it. I think it's really catchy, albeit stupid, but I mean...are we really surprised by this anymore? People are like ""Pretty Fly (For a White Guy)"" was at least clever; this is just so stupid."" News flash: They're BOTH stupid, but they're both uniquely clever in their satirization of current pop music. I don't normally like a lot of music that's repeated on the radio, but because this is mad catchy (like irritatingly so), I'll give it a bit of a boost. 4.5/5
7) ""All I Have Left Is You"" - Simply looking at the track titles, if you had to pick one song to be a slow, romantic ballad, you'd pick this one, right? And you'd be absolutely correct. At 5:18, it's the longest song The Offspring have done, either (since I don't count ""Pay the Man's"" five-minute intro as part of that song, or any track with a hidden ""song"" or message at the end - a la Smash and Ixnay because the reason they're so long is mostly silence). But it's growing on me a little; it's not that repetitive, which is surprising for a song of its length. Much better than ""Fix You"" from the last album, if nothing else. 3.5/5
8) ""OC Guns"" - I don't know why this song isn't getting more flak. It's just...not good. Bassist Greg K. apparently said in an interview that this was on his favorite songs of the record. I really think it's just because it's the only song you can really hear the bass on. I think it's supposed to be about gang violence, but rest assured, this is not ""Come Out and Play Part II."" From the crappy Spanish rapping to the ""tiki, tiki, tiki, tiki, what up holmes,"" it's just a poor effort all around. 1.5/5
9) ""Dirty Magic"" - I still think this is kind of cheating...""Dirty Magic"" is a song from 1992's Ignition, and any time a song gets re-recorded for an album, there's always the risk of doing it wrong. I really like this update, as the original is one of my favorites by the band. But there's still a part of me that wonders if another new song could have been included as well. 4.5/5
10) ""I Wanna Secret Family (With You)"" - These last three songs are my favorite on the album. This is definitely a poppy summer jam, and would have satisfied fans a lot more than ""Cruising California"" did, mainly because this isn't entirely a joke song. It's still extremely poppy, in a similar vein to ""Want You Bad,"" but I also hear things like The Wonders in it. Just really, REALLY catchy. And it's awesome. 5/5
11) ""Dividing By Zero"" - After the extreme pop of the previous track, The Offspring write probably their ""punkiest"" song in years. This seems to be an early consensus for favorite off the album from a lot of reviewers, and I don't think I'm an exception. It's fast, it's furious, and it's supremely melodic and will get stuck in your head. It borrows some elements from their self-titled album and Ignition (mostly with a middle-Eastern guitar sound in parts), but mostly it just rocks, and is actually the beginning of a two-part medley with the next track. 5/5
12) ""Slim Pickens Does The Right Thing And Rides the Bomb to Hell"" - Despite its Fall Out Boy-esque title, this song is fantastic. It's got a little Bad Religion feel to it, and these may be some of the best lyrics Dexter Holland has ever penned. It's an excellent way to close the album, and is probably my favorite final track on any Offspring record. 5/5
All in all, there are a few hiccups along the way, but the final third of the album is among the band's finest work. Die-hard Offspring fans will eat this one right up. And newbies may find enough in the beginning to latch onto. Definitely worth checking out.
Final Score: 4/5",en,web

"Hi everyone! I hope you are having a great week so far! I've been soooooo busy lately its been hard to find time to blog and read my favorites. I had a midterm and I've been trying to figure out what I'm doing this summer: i.e. taking summer school/finding an internship. I know summer seems far away, and it kind of is, but every other law student has started the process. The finding an internship part can be daunting and exhausting, but hopefully everything will pan out soon enough.
Now let's get cheerful! I absolutely love how art influences fashion. Take a look at Jackson Pollock's Shimmering Substance and Christian Louboutin's new Pigalles. You can totally see how Louboutin was influenced by abstract art and Pollock's signature drip painting. Art history was one of my favorite subjects in college (I was a political science major).

"Fun With the Animals: Joseph Beuys Text Painting
acrylic on canvas
396.2 x 243.8
In a giant incomprehensible flow chart (a form borrowed from Beuys’s blackboard works), he maps out the ‘six degrees of separation’ of his art heroes, linking them impossibly to each other, and inevitably back to Beuys. It requires the complicated linear thinking of a late-night drinking game, but Davies proves it’s only twelve easy jumps from Picasso to Sarah Lucas (if Peter Doig and Matthew Barney’s love of sport can be counted as an actual link). Peter Davies presents an art history on a functional level: it’s about as close to science as it gets.",en,unknown
"Today I am going to show you this sweet Birthday Chipboard Banner that is another new item from Clear Scraps this year.
The Chipboard Birthday Banner comes with 7 pieces, approximate sizes are 1 cupcake 8""x8"", 4 small banners 6.5""x6"", 2 stars 4.5""x6"".
Here is the banner all decorated. It spells out Sweetie, and I thought it would be perfect to hang up around Valentines Day. I used the lovely collection from Crate Paper called Fourteen to dress up this banner.
I adhered all the pattern papers to the chipboard pieces. Then came back in with various new Mascils and mist to add a little texture and interest.
I also added this Swirl Acrylic Border to two pieces on this banner. If you look at the top right closely, you can see where I cut this swirl border in half to create the second piece. I then decorated it with alcohol ink, then adhered it to my star.
Here is where I used the other half of the Swirl border I mentioned above.
I just love it!
On this next banner piece, I added this small Scallop Acrylic Frame to accentuate the cuties on the paper. I edged it in Viva Decor Pearl Pen to dress it up.
Here's a better close up of the frame
And the very last piece to the banner. I used the fabulous fans mascil for this piece.
I tied it all up using some twine from The Twinery.

"The annual tree lighting ceremony at Rockefeller Center has traditionally been the official event to kick off the holidays in the Big Apple. Grammy and Pappy decided that the Morgan household would take a cue from the world-famous tree lighting and kick off our own holidays in similar fashion.
Last year, Grammy and Pappy purchased a small pine tree which they had shipped from Maine for our daughter Isabella's first Christmas with the intention that we would decorate the tree each year and it would grow with her through the years. Unfortunately, my husband and I neglected to properly water and nourish the tree and this year it looks more like the pathetic sapling made famous in the TV special ""A Charlie Brown Christmas."" Fortunately for our daughter, Grammy and Pappy went into recovery mode and purchased a slightly larger, flourishing young tree to ensure the tradition they wanted to begin would carry on. Not wanting to see the same disastrous ending for this second woody perennial, my husband and I diligently watered and cared for it over the past few months. After all, if we killed this tree as well, I am pretty sure the grandparents would have killed the annual tradition they were so looking forward to.
With our beautiful, small bushy pine planted in the backyard, Grammy announced this weekend was the time to hold our first annual Morgan Family Tree Lighting ceremony. She was sure to add that she would take care of everything, and my husband and I ""needn't do a thing."" Sounded good to us. My husband and I have many great ideas, but aren't always so good on the follow-through, especially now that much our our time is consumed caring for our tiny tot.
The grandparents purchased the lights for the tree and arrived bright and early on Saturday morning to string up the lights for the big event. My daughter, who was outside to supervise the preparations, was dressed in a big, heavy winter coat and looked strikingly similar to little boy from the movie ""A Christmas Story"". Isabella started to waddle over to the ceremonial site to help decorate, however she abruptly toppled over and in true fashion of a child's constricting winter coat, could not get up. Isabella attempted to roll from side to side in hopes that the rocking motion would provide her the momentum she needed to stand up, however no go. She was down for the count. Though she was not much help to us while on the ground, the good news was she couldn't get herself into any more trouble!
With the lights on the tree and the family expected to arrive later for dinner before the grand event, my husband set to work readying the viewing room. In a sweet gesture and nod to the start of this new tradition, he set up a space heater and chairs in our enclosed sun room, and displayed festive red candles to provide a cozy ambiance for the ceremony.
To commence the festivities, Grammy and Pappy set up the dinner table with festive paper products, pizzas and Stromboli from our favorite Italian restaurant. Dessert consisted of a delectable cookie tray and hot cocoa to help set the mood for the sweet seasonal new tradition to follow.
With our bellies full and hot cocoa in our hands, the family gathered in the sun room to watch the tree lighting. With the push of a button, the bright, sparkly colored lights illuminated our little tree. At first there was stunned silence, which was followed by some laughing. Apparently the family truly thought we were lighting a tree that would be a little closer in size to the real Rockefeller pine.
Though the little 4 foot pine may have elicited a few snickers from both our relatives and any onlooking neighbors, the look on my daughter's face when the lights sparkled in the night was priceless. Kudos to Grammy and Pappy for introducing a creative and thoughtful new tradition to our family. It is certainly a wonderful way to kick off the season each year, and something we will cherish for years to come.
My husband and I are very interested in learning about new holiday traditions that we could share with our daughter to make the season special. If you have any family traditions that you would like to share, please email me at Morganblog@yahoo.com or feel free to post them on our momsJerseyShore.com forum. I look forward to hearing how you make the holidays memorable.",en,web

"GEF and UNEP Launch Global Platform for Efficient Lighting
25 September 2009: The Global Environment Facility (GEF) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) have launched the “Global Market Transformation for Efficient Lighting Platform,” a public-private partnership directed at reducing global energy demand for lighting.
The Platform aims to transform lighting markets, primarily in developing countries, by fostering the usage and production of energy efficient lighting while gradually discontinuing use of incandescent lighting, and substituting traditional fuel-based lighting with modern, efficient alternatives such as solid-state lighting (SSL) and Light Emitting Diode (LED) lamps. It is hoped that, through these efforts, global demand for lighting energy can eventually be reduced by up to 18 percent.
In attendance for the event was UNEP Executive Director Achim Steiner, who noted that “in terms of climate change, this is among the lowest of low-hanging fruit. Eight percent of global greenhouse gas emissions are linked with lighting; this project can by 2014 make a big dent in these while saving people money too.” [UN News Centre] [GEF press release]",en,web

Citing a desire for more floor time and a chance to play closer to home, Williams - a 6-2 guard who saw an average of 9.2 minutes a game and scored 3.4 points a contest - said he wanted to make the right personal decision.
""I appreciate the opportunity to have played at ETSU and I wish the team the best of luck in the future,"" Williams said. ""I want to thank the coaching staff for working with me to make me a better player over the last two years.""
Bartow said Williams has been an important part of the ETSU team the last two seasons.
""Dante has consistently worked hard in practice and done anything we asked of him,"" Bartow said. ""We understand his decision to transfer and wish him all the best.""
With Williams' departure the Bucs now have three scholarships open for the 2007-08 signing class.

"Genomic/ Proteomic/ Metabonomic Profiling in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic disease characterized by progressive airflow obstruction, chronic cough and dyspnoea in advanced stages.
Techniques such as genomics, proteomics and metabonomics, Technologies that aim to identify and quantify the dynamic set of all small molecules and metabolites present in an organism or a biological sample, offer the prospect of efficiently distinguishing individuals with particular diseases. The advantages of proteomics and metabonomics is that it can be carried out on a standard preparation of serum, plasma or urine, circumventing the need for specialist preparation of cellular mRNA required for genomics This methodology is based on mass spectrometry (MS), gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to analyze metabolites. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) may also be applied. Several peak alignment algorithms have been developed to match the chromatograms before applying pattern recognition. Based on the pattern recognition, several potential biomarkers may be found and further identified by MS.. Finally, a number of potential biomarkers will be identified for distinguishing asthma and COPD.
We hope to develop a better understanding of lung disease. Information from these studies will only be used for research purposes, to help develop safer and more effective treatments for asthma and COPD.

"Multicenter Study on Fibrotic Valvular Heart Disease in Patients With Parkinson's Disease Treated With Dopamine Agonists
Fibrotic valvular heart diseases are known as rare complications of long-time therapy of Parkinson's disease with ergot-derivatives including some ergot-dopamine agonists. The aim of this study is to assess the incidence of valvular heart disease, which may be an ergot-drug agonists side-effect or an overall complication of all dopamine agonists. Incidence, prevalence and addiction of dose or intake duration are not known so far. The reversibility of the changes is unknown too. To answer these questions the present study is designed as a cross sectional study followed by a 2 year follow-up prospective cohort study.
Heart Valve Diseases
|Study Design:||Observational Model: Cohort
Time Perspective: Prospective
|Official Title:||A National, Multicenter Study on Fibrotic Valvular Heart Disease in Patients With Parkinson´s Disease Treated With Dopamine Agonists|
|Study Start Date:||March 2005|
|Estimated Study Completion Date:||December 2013|
Rare incidence of pleuropulmonary and retroperitoneal fibrosis are known complications during the long-time therapy of Parkinson's disease (PD) with ergot-drug derivatives including some ergot dopamine agonists. Particularly the appearance of fibrotic valvular heart disease of Parkinson patients under Pergolide therapy caused an intense discussion about the safety of dopamine agonists at all. Single case reports of similar heart valve changes under the therapy of Bromocriptin and probably Cabergoline pointed to an effect of the whole substance class of the ergot-dopamine agonists.
Cross-Sectional Study (part I):
Within this study an initial cross-sectional analysis of the prevalence of fibrotic heart valvular disease will be done. Patients with Parkinson's disease with different exposition status will be recruited. An transthoracal echocardiographic examination (TTE) of the heart will be performed.
- patients with ergot-derived dopamine agonists
- patients with non-ergot-derived dopamine agonists
- After the TTE-report the study population is divided in affected (= pathological TTE-report: fibrotic valvular heart diseases) and healthy persons (= non-pathological TTE-report: no fibrotic valvular heart diseases). The therapy with dopamine agonist will be stopped in patients with a pathological TTE-report. Instead these patients will be treated with an equivalent dose of L-Dopa with or without COMT-inhibitors. The existing therapy regime will remain in patients without pathological findings.
Longitudinal Section (part II and III):
The cross-sectional study (part I) is followed by a two year follow-up study.
- patients with pathological TTE-report: fibrotic valvular heart disease
- patients without pathological TTE-report: no fibrotic valvular heart disease
Part II: Within cohort I the reversibility of fibrotic valvular heart disease will be analysed with regard to the previously taken cumulative dose of dopamine agonists.
Part III: Within cohort II there will be a prospective analysis of the (cumulative) incidence of fibrotic valvular heart disease in PD patients with different exposition status. If fibrotic valvular heart disease occurs, a patient will be changed from cohort II to cohort I.
Cross-sectional study (part I):
- What is the prevalence of fibrotic valvular heart disease in PD patients under therapy with ergot-derived dopamine agonists and non-ergot-derived dopamine agonists?
- Is there an influence to the cumulative dose of dopamine agonists?
Longitudinal study (prospective cohort study):
- (Part II) Is fibrotic valvular heart disease under therapy of ergot-derived dopamine agonists and non-ergot-derived dopamine agonists reversible?
- (Part III) What is the (cumulative) incidence of fibrotic valvular heart disease under the therapy of ergot-derived dopamine agonists and non-ergot-derived dopamine agonists?

"Tigers rally, fend off White Sox late
Valverde went to a 3-1 count on Alex Rios before a trainer and manager Jim Leyland went to the mound. Valverde left the game and the nature of his injury was not immediately known.
Chicago starter Jake Peavy sailed into the sixth with a 6-0 lead before Cabrera hit a two-run homer to the back of the bleachers in left field.
A double by Prince Fielder, who had three hits, and a hit batter set up Raburn's first homer of the season. After Peavy walked Jhonny Peralta, reliever Will Ohman (0-2) hit pinch-hitter Delmon Young and Jackson followed a three-run homer.
Raburn and Peralta added RBI singles off Nate Jones in the seventh.
Pierzynski went 5 for 5 and drove in three runs. Paul Konerko homered for Chicago.
Alejandro De Aza singled in the bottom of the first and walks to Gordon Beckham and Konerko loaded the bases. Pierzynski hit an RBI single and another run scored on the play when left fielder Don Kelly fumbled the ball for an error.
Konerko hit his seventh homer and Viciedo added an RBI single in the third for a 4-0 lead.
Detroit starter Max Scherzer labored with 99 pitches in his four-plus innings, allowing eight hits and five earned runs. After singles by Adam Dunn and Konerko in the fifth, Scherzer was relieved by Collin Balester (2-0), who threw a wild pitch and then gave up a two-run single to Pierzynski.
NOTES: Raburn has hit 13 of his 54 career homers against the White Sox. ... Former major league pitcher Jim Abbott, who played with the White Sox and was a teammate of Robin Ventura's, threw out the first pitch to the first-year Chicago manager. ...

"Telling Your Structured Stories
by Michael Neece, CEO, InterviewMastery.com
Today we're discussing a powerful technique called “Structured Storytelling” and how to use it to effectively respond to most job interview questions.
The storytelling technique is not the telling of fictional stories. Structured storytelling is the telling of true stories about you. Telling structured stories is an effective way to describe events in your past and how these events demonstrate your multiple talents. It is also effective in describing how you would approach future situations. I'll elaborate on this shortly.
Interviewers ask you to tell them stories seeking proof of your abilities. It is not enough for you to say you have certain abilities. You must provide proof of your talents by telling structured stories that demonstrate each of your skills. For example, if the interviewer asks about your problem solving abilities, stating that you're a strong problem solver is not enough. You must provide proof by telling a story about when you solved a challenging problem.
Interviewers ask three types of questions: questions focused on the Past; questions focused the Future; and questions focused on Stupid Stuff. Stupid interviewer questions are also called ""frequently asked questions"" or ""common interview questions. They include, “Tell me about yourself,” “What are your strengths?”, “What are your weaknesses?”, “How many airplanes are in the skies over the USA right now?”, and other overused, irrelevant questions that have nothing to do with assessing your abilities.
Questions about the past are called “behavioral-event interview questions” because the questions ask about your past behaviors during specific events. These types of questions are easy to recognize because they begin with phrases like “Describe a specific time…”, Give me an example …”, or “Describe a situation …”.
Questions about the future are also easy to recognize because they include the phrase “what if.” These questions ask you to describe what you would do if you faced a particular situation. The key to spotting future-oriented questions is the phrase “what if”.
When you're asked questions about your past or future, your response in both cases is to tell a structured story.
You tell your stories using the following structure: Before, During, After. Stated in more detail, you describe what the situation was before you took action; what you did during taking action; and what happened after you took action. For example, if your interviewer says, “Describe a situation when you solved a difficult problem,” you would describe the problem situation before you took action, then describe what you did during taking action, and finally describe the situation after you took action.
The Before-During-After storytelling structure is also called the Situation-Action-Results structure where you describe the situation, action, and results for a specific event in your past. I prefer the Before-During-After framework because it is very easy to remember and follows a time line.
To make your stories very compelling, conclude each story by describing what you Learned.
This is very important. Describing what you learned distinguishes you from other candidates and subliminally communicates that you assess what is learned from each situation in order to constantly improve your skills and value to your employer.
Putting it all together, your structured stories are told using the following framework:
Before, During, After, Learned.
Before your next interview, list each of the job requirements. Next to each requirement, write down the stories you will tell to demonstrate your qualifications.
The biggest mistake applicants make is spending more time on their resume than preparing for each interview. Most people spent 20 or more hours writing and modifying their resume and only 1 hour preparing for the interview. Some people spend hundreds of dollars on resume-writing services but still only spend an hour preparing for the only event that can get them hired - the interview. If you spend 8 to 10 hours preparing for each interview, this investment alone will improve your interview performance.
Remember, the job interview is the most important moment in your job search. Your resume may get you to the interview, but only your job interview skills will secure the job offer. The most qualified person rarely gets the job. It's the person who interviews the best who wins the job offer.
Good luck on your next interview. You're going to be awesome!",en,web
"impressment, forcible enrollment of recruits for military duty. Before the establishment of conscription, many countries supplemented their militia and mercenary troops by impressment. In England, impressment began as early as the Anglo-Saxon period and was used extensively under Elizabeth I, Charles I, and Oliver Cromwell. ""Press gangs"" forcibly seized and carried individuals into service; frequently subjects of foreign countries were taken. After 1800, England restricted impressment mostly to naval service. The Napoleonic Wars increased English need for sea power and led to the impressment of a large number of deserters, criminals, and British subjects who had become naturalized Americans. (Until 1850, England did not recognize the right of a man to renounce his nationality.) Frequent interception of American ships (see Chesapeake) to impress American citizens was a major cause of the War of 1812. England generally abandoned such forcible measures after 1835. In Prussia, impressment was introduced by Frederick William I after 1713, laying the groundwork for Prussian military power in the 18th cent. It reached its height under Frederick II (Frederick the Great) who made forced recruitment on foreign soil an integral part of the Prussian military system. Impressment was used in many countries as a method of ridding society of undesirables. Persons of property, apprenticed youths, and other respectable citizens were often exempted by law. The system fostered gross abuses and was often a means of private vengeance. It filled the army and navy with a group ready for mutiny, desertion, or other disloyalty, and it adversely affected voluntary recruitment. After 1800 impressment tended to become a means of enforcing conscription, and it fell into disuse after 1850.

While this is clearly a ""transitional"" web site, I suggest you continue to provide the opportunity for citizen input through the official NYS web site. While the current site offers a great deal of information, it is challenging to find ways for citizens to provide input or feedback to the Executive or Legislative branches of government.

"Bastoy, Norway (CNN) -- Jan Petter Vala, who is serving a prison sentence for murder, has hands the size of dinner plates and shoulders like those of an ox. In an alcoholic rage, he used his brutish strength to strangle his girlfriend to death a few years ago.
On a recent Thursday, however, at this summer-camp-like island prison in southern Norway, where convicts hold keys to their rooms and there are no armed guards or fences, Vala used those same enormous hands to help bring life into the world.
The 42-year-old murderer stood watch while an oversize cow gave birth to a wobbly, long-legged, brown-and-white calf. He cried as the baby was born, he said, and wiped slime off of the newborn's face so she could gulp her first breath.
Afterward, Vala called his own mother to share the good news.
""I told my family that I'm going to be a dad,"" he said, beaming with pride.
This is exactly the type of dramatic turnabout -- enraged killer to gentle-giant midwife -- that corrections officials in Norway hope to create with this controversial, one-of-a-kind prison, arguably the cushiest the world has to offer.
Founded in 1982, Bastoy Prison is located on a lush, 1-square-mile island of pine trees and rocky coasts, with views of the ocean that are postcard-worthy. It feels more like a resort than jail, and prisoners here enjoy freedoms that would be unthinkable elsewhere.
It's the holiday version of Alcatraz.
There's a beach where prisoners sunbathe in the summer, plenty of good fishing spots, a sauna and tennis courts. Horses roam gravel roads. Some of the 115 prisoners here -- all men and serving time for murder, rape and trafficking heroin, among other crimes -- stay in wooden cottages, painted cheery red. They come and go as they please. Others live in ""The Big House,"" a white mansion on a hill that, on the inside, looks like a college dorm. A chicken lives in the basement, a guard said, and provides eggs for the inmates.
When you ask the cook what's for dinner, he offers up menu choices like ""fish balls with white sauce, with shrimps"" and ""everything from chicken con carne to salmon.""
Plenty of people would pay to vacation in a place like this.
On first read, all of that probably sounds infuriating. Shouldn't these men be punished? Why do they get access to all these comforts while others live in poverty?
But if the goal of prison is to change people, Bastoy seems to work.
""If we have created a holiday camp for criminals here, so what?"" asked Arne Kvernvik Nilsen, the prison's governor and a former minister and psychologist. He added, ""We should reduce the risk of reoffending, because if we don't, what's the point of punishment, except for leaning toward the primitive side of humanity?""
Take a quick look at the numbers: Only 20% of prisoners who come through Norway's prisons reoffend within two years of being released, according to a 2010 report commissioned by the governments of several Nordic countries.
At Bastoy, that figure is even lower, officials say: about 16%.
Compare that with the three-year re-offense rate for state prisons in the U.S.: 43%, according to a 2011 report from the Pew Center on the States, a nonpartisan research group. Older government reports put that number even higher, at more than five in 10.
Ryan King, a research director at Pew and an author of the group's recent report, said it's difficult to compare recidivism rates from state to state, much less from country to country. Instead of focusing on the numbers, he said, one should focus on what a country is or isn't doing to tackle re-offense rates.
Still, Bastoy remains controversial even in academia. Irvin Waller, president of the International Organization for Victim Assistance and a professor at the University of Ottawa, said in an e-mail that the relative niceness of a prison has no effect on whether people commit crimes when they're released. ""The key is not that much what happens in prison but what happens when the men are released,"" he said.
But officials here maintain that their methods do make a difference, and they follow it up with post-release programs. The aim of Bastoy is not to punish or seek revenge, Nilsen said. The only punishment is to take away the prisoner's right to be a free member of society.
Even at a time when Anders Behring Breivik is on trial in Norway for killing 77 people in a terror attack last year -- and the remote possibility he could end up at Bastoy or a similar prison some day -- Nilsen and others stand up for this brand of justice.
Life at Bastoy
To understand Norway's pleasant-prison philosophy, first you have to get a sense of how life at a cushy, low-security prison like Bastoy actually plays out.
There are few rules here. Prisoners can have TVs in their rooms, provided they bring them from ""outside"" when they're sentenced. They wear whatever clothes they want: jeans, T-shirts. One man had a sweater with pink-and-gray horizontal stripes, but that's as close as it got to the jailbird look. Even guards aren't dressed in uniform, which makes conducting interviews tricky. It's impossible to tell an officer from a drug trafficker.
A common opening question: ""So, do you live here?""
Everyone at Bastoy has a job, and prisoners must report to work from 8:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. weekdays. Some people garden; others farm. Some chop down trees and slice them into firewood (It's hard not to think about the wood chipper scene in ""Fargo"" when you see inmates filleting tree trunks with an enormous circular saw). Others tend to a team of horses, which are used to cart wood and supplies from one part of the island to another. Everyone moves about freely during these tasks. Guards are sometimes present, sometimes not. No one wears shackles or electronic monitoring bracelets.
The idea is for prison to function like a small, self-sustaining village.
For their work, inmates are paid. They get a stipend of 59 Norwegian kroner per day, about $10. They can save that money or spend it on odds and ends in a local shop. Additionally, they get a monthly stipend of about $125 for their food. Kitchen workers -- that's another inmate job -- serve Bastoy residents dinner each day. For breakfast and lunch, inmates use their stipend to make purchases in the local shop and then cook for themselves at home. Many live in small houses that have full kitchens. Others have access to shared cooking space.
The goal, Nilsen said, is to create an environment where people can build self-esteem and reform their lives. ""They look at themselves in the mirror, and they think, 'I am s***. I don't care. I am nothing,' "" he said. This prison, he says, gives them a chance to see they have worth, ""to discover, 'I'm not such a bad guy.' ""
In locked-down prisons, inmates are treated ""like animals or robots,"" he said, moving from one planned station to the next, with no choice in the matter. Here, inmates are forced to make choices -- to learn how to be better people.
Prisoners, of course, appreciate this approach.
Kjell Amundsen, a 70-year-old who said he is in jail for a white-collar financial crime, was terrified when he rode the 15-minute ferry from the mainland out to Bastoy.
On a recent afternoon, he was sweeping up in a plant nursery while John Lennon's ""Imagine"" played on the radio. ""I think it's marvelous to be in a prison this way,"" he said.
He plans to keep up the task after his sentence ends. ""I'm living in a flat (when I get out), but I am convinced I should have a little garden,"" he said.
Some prisoners get schooling in a yellow Bavarian-style building near the center of the island. On a recent afternoon, three young men were learning to use computer programs to create 3-D models of cars. All expressed interest in doing this sort of work after their prison terms end.
Tom Remi Berg, a 22-year-old who said he is in prison for the third time after getting into a bar fight and beating a man nearly to death, said he is finally learning his lesson at Bastoy.
He works in the kitchen and is seeking training to become a chef when he's released. He also plays in the prison blues band -- Guilty as Hell -- and lives with his bandmates.
""It's good to have a prison like this,"" he said. ""You can learn to start a new page again.""
If escaped, please call
The prisoners are required to check in several times a day so guards can make sure they're still on the island. Nothing but 1½ miles of seawater stops them from leaving; they'd only have to steal one of the prison's boats to cross it, several inmates said.
An escape would be relatively easy.
Prisoners have tried to escape in the past. One swam halfway across the channel and became stranded on a buoy and screamed for rescuers to help, prison officials said. Another made it across the channel by stealing a boat but was caught on the other side.
Many, however, don't want to leave. If they tried and failed, they would be forced to go to a higher-security prison and could have their sentences extended.
When inmates come to his island jail, Nilsen, the governor, gives them a little talk.
Among the wisdom he imparts is this: If you should escape and make it across the water to the free shore, find a phone and call so I know you're OK and ""so we don't have to send the coast guard looking for you.""
This kind of trust may seem shocking or naïve from the outside, but it's the entire basis for Bastoy's existence. Overnight, only three or four guards (the prison employs 71 administrative staff, including the guards) stay on the island with this group of people who have been convicted of serious crimes. If guards carried weapons (which they don't) it might encourage inmates to take up arms, too, he said.
Further complicating the security situation, some inmates, toward the end of their terms, are allowed to leave the island on a daily ferry to work or attend classes on the mainland.
They're expected to come back on their own free will.
Inmates are screened to make sure they're mentally stable and unlikely to plot an escape before they come to Bastoy. The vast majority -- 97%, according to Nilsen -- have served part of their sentences at higher-security jails in Norway. In the four years Nilsen has been heading up the prison, there have been no ""serious"" incidents of violence, he said.
By the time they get to Bastoy, inmates view the island as a relief.
'It's still prison'
There's a question inmates here get asked frequently: When your sentence is up, will you want to leave?
The answer, despite the nice conditions, is always an emphatic yes.
""It's still prison,"" said Luke, 23. He didn't want his full name used for fear future employers would see it. ""In your mind, you are locked (up).""
The simple fact of being taken away from family members is enough to stop Benny, 40, from wanting to offend again. The refugee from Kosovo said he was convicted on drug charges after he was found with 13 pounds of heroin. He didn't want his full name used because he doesn't want to embarrass his family or jeopardize his chance of finding a job after he's released.
Before coming to Bastoy, he sat in a higher-security prison while one of his children was born.
""It doesn't matter how long the sentences get. The sentence doesn't matter,"" Benny said. ""When you take freedom from people, that's what's scary.""
There are only 3,600 people in prison in this country, compared with 2.3 million in the United States, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. Relative to population, the U.S. has about 10 times as many inmates as Norway.
More than 89% of Norway's jail sentences are less than a year, officials said. In U.S. federal prisons, longer sentences are much more common, with fewer than 2% serving a year or less, according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons.
Some researchers support Norway's efforts to lighten sentences.
Think of prison like parenting and it starts to make sense, said Mark A.R. Kleiman, a professor of public policy at UCLA and author of ""When Brute Force Fails.""
""Every parent knows this. What if you tried to discipline your kid by saying, 'If you don't clean your room, there's a 10% chance I'll kick you out of the house and never see you again'?"" he said, referencing the fact that many crimes in America go unpunished, but the justice system issues harsh sentences when offenders are caught. Grounding the child immediately, a softer sentence, would work better, even though the punishment is less severe, he said.
""We have a criminal justice system (in the United States) that, if it were a parent, we would say it's abusive and neglectful.""
Kleiman said victims do have a right to see offenders punished. But in Norway, a country with one of the highest standards of living in the world, staying on a resort-like island with horses might feel like punishment to many people, he said.
Research also suggests that programs like Bastoy that train inmates for their transition back into the free world -- with education, counseling and such -- do help prisoners adjust.
""There is overwhelming evidence that rehabilitation works much better than deterrence as a means of reducing re-offending,"" said Gerhard Ploeg, a senior adviser at the Ministry of Justice, which oversees Norway's corrections system.
""It's all in the name of reintegration,"" he added. ""You won't be suddenly one day standing on the street with a plastic bag of things you had when you came in.""
Mass shooting challenges system
Norway's unusual prison policies have been pushed into the international spotlight after a bombing and shooting spree last year in which 77 people were killed, including children.
There's a chance -- although minimal -- that Anders Behring Breivik, who confessed to those crimes, could end up in Bastoy, one of Norway's ""open prisons,"" Nilsen said.
It's more likely Breivik will be sent to one of Norway's many high-security ""closed"" prisons, which look much more like their U.S. counterparts.
He also could be set free some day. Norway has a maximum jail sentence of 21 years, which can be extended only when an inmate is deemed to be a real and imminent threat to society. The country expects nearly every prisoner to be returned to society, which influences its efforts to create jail environments that reduce re-offense rates.
""The question we must ask is, 'What kind of person do I want as my neighbor?' "" Ploeg said. ""How do we want people to come out of prison? If your neighbor were to come out of prison, what would you want him to be like?""
Still, it's likely Breivik's sentence will be extended to the point that he will spend his life in a high-security prison, he said. Or he could go into life-long psychiatric care.
Breivik's case challenges a system that hopes to fix everyone.
The case has unearthed levels of anger that are uncharacteristic of Norway, which prides itself as a home for conflict mediation and human rights, a place that hosts the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony and has one of the best standards of living in the world.
Last week, a man lit himself on fire outside the Oslo courthouse where Breivik's trial is taking place. His motives were unclear, police said.
""(Breivik) doesn't deserve to go to prison,"" said Camilla Bjerke, 27, who tends bar in Horten, the town on the other side of the water from Bastoy. ""He deserves to be hanged outside the courthouse. ... He's just going to go into prison and watch TV and download movies.""
Then there's this sentiment: If Breivik were ever released into the public, someone would kill him, several Norwegians said. Inmates at Bastoy echoed those sentiments, saying he would have to be quarantined or he wouldn't be safe on the island.
Others are trying to fight that anger.
Bjorn Ihler, a 20-year-old who narrowly escaped Breivik's shooting spree by diving into the ocean with two children while bullets flew at them, said, ""it's very important that we don't let this terrorist change the way we are and the way things work.""
""The prison system in Norway is based around the principle of getting criminals back into society, really, and away from their criminal life -- and to get them normal jobs and stuff like that,"" he said.
He doesn't know how he would feel if Breivik were to be released, but he would like the system to function as usual. ""So prisons must be very much focused on getting people to a place where they are able to live normal, non-criminal lives. And that's the best way of preserving society from crime, I think.""
Looking to the future
All of these efforts aim to help a person like Vala, the gentle giant who strangled his girlfriend, to get ready for release back into society at the end of his 10-year sentence.
After he helped a toddling calf come into the world, Vala said, he leaned on a rail next to the cow's pen and thought about his life and the murder that landed him here. The symbolism that he had used his hands to end one life and help begin another was not lost on him. ""I stayed for six hours,"" he said. ""It was very beautiful.""
The night he killed his girlfriend, Vala says, he blacked out and then came to with his hands around her neck, after she was dead.
""We never fight,"" he said. ""We never do. So I don't know what happened.""
He felt helpless and out of control when he came to.
But now he's trying to pull it together. He decided to quit drinking for good. And when he's working with animals, he said, feels a new calm wash over him.
It's a change the prison guards have noted, too. Sigurd Vedvik said he met Vala while he was serving out the earlier part of his sentence in a high-security prison. Vedvik was screening him for entry into Bastoy. Vala barely could communicate. He seemed broken.
""When he first came here, he was very afraid of many people,"" said Vedvik, who sees himself as more of a teacher or social worker than a person who enforces security.
Now, Vala is making friends. Talking more. Taking responsibility for the cattle he's tasked with caring for. He strokes the cows' necks so gently, it seems as if he's worried they will shatter.
When Vala leaves Bastoy, he plans to go into the construction business and hopes to find some way to spend time on a farm.
""I'm trying to think to my future.""
That's something he couldn't do after the murder.
And it took a posh prison -- one with cattle and horses -- to get him into that state of mind.",en,web
"I just finished the book, and I had mixed feelings.
On the one hand, I liked Mara's journey, and I liked how well Han was written. I really liked the Hand of Judgment, though except for LaRone they all kind of seem the same.
Click here to see the hidden message (It might contain spoilers)
I liked the various manipulations done by both Thrawn and Nuso Esva, but I didn't feel that Esva's motivations were either very well established, or just generic. He hates Thrawn, he wants to conquer, etc. But that doesn't seem to be enough for me. Also, I felt a bit cheesed that Lord Odo was Esva all along and not Thrawn. I mean, Thrawn's full name is Mit'thrawnuruodo (I think I missed an apostrophe in there). Seems like a dead giveaway. I assumed that Odo was Thrawn and Sorro was Car'das, but then it turns out they're on a whole other ship that just happens to be following Chimaera the whole time? I would've preferred that Odo be Thrawn, and Esva simply have agents deep in Chimaera's command structure.
I'll admit, this next comment is based heavily on the fact that I read this sporadically over many weeks, but I just couldn't get into it as much as I wanted to. If I enjoyed it more from the get-go, I'd've been more motivated to keep with it, but nay.
It was the year of fire… the year of destruction… the year we took back what was ours.
It was the year of rebirth… the year of great sadness… the year of pain… and the year of joy.
It was a new age. It was the end of history. It was the year everything changed.

See, Abhishek understands. The more queens on the board, the better the stalemate chances -- a motto that has proven fundamental in my chess career. But how do you win on time with a lone king? That's a draw on time.
If there is no chance of draw or victory if your opponent plays to their usual strength, or if you know beyond reasonable doubt that your opponent can see the line to mate, it is not bad form to resign. If you know your opponent looks down on resigners maybe you can play it to mate. I usually find this is more common with amateur players.
I believe people who continue playing is more honest. If the opponent play with an engine, then a blunder from an honest player will become an irritation to their cheating rival. It mean that the cheater will know that he have the winning line, and the honest will play in the hope that the cheater blunder.
If the player is really very good, and honest, he will know that he had challenged a too weaker player, and he will have an opportunity to show off his skills to inspire his also honest opponent.
People who become annoyed are self centered, they feel they just want to walk over their opponent, and make as if they do not exist.They think that life is just plain sailing. One can alway's ignore the blunder, and a skilled player can even make an equal blunder if he see that the opponent made a mistake. After all, it is rare to play a honest player, and if you have the honour of playing one, i believe you can sit back and relax, and just measure your skills to another human, and not a brick wall that never give slack.
Anyhow, if you do meet a grandmaster, he will have you so quickly tied up, that you want to resign anyhow, some would want to quit playing forever...
I don't think it is a good manner to resign just because you have a better insight in the line at hand. There are many surprises, and no one is just a pushover.
if you are annoyed, why challenge a weaker player. If he have the same rating than you, then it is you who you play against. If the opponent is stronger, why would you want him to resign? He will resign, because it is humiliating for him, because a stronger player, cannot loose against a weaker one. The weaker player will not be as forgiving to pardon mistakes from a stronger player, because he will never get such an opportunity, and it is actually why a weaker player will remain weak.
Chess without deep thought, is just a waste of time, its like going through life without gaining something for the soul.
one can also resign if you choose to play black, is white not the stronger line to play?
to resighn early, can be an indication of your insight in a game, in such a way that your oponent have not even picked up on.
Or you can resign if you see your oponent had missed an oportunity to mate you. Do you really want to win after you know that your oponent had blundered?
All such questions...
Then you can resign at a point in the game of climax...which if you add anything to the game, would just mess it up for the imagination....but let us leave that for the greatest of great players.
People give up too easily. Stay and fight your hardest, being behind will force you to learn more about positions, piece potential and give you a good look at end game play; and because the other person feels super confident, with a little ingenuity you might be able to get them in a trap.
Also if the game is so far gone, it should only take a few moves to mate, and this is a learning oppertunity as well for leader, to visualize new mates.
However if a person is not trying their best and just wasting time, resign. Resign to be polite, not to cry. If you think you have a chance go ahead and give it your best.
There are few absolutes, if any, in life and chess. A resignation wears many faces. In a few cases the face is that of a sore loser. Most often it is the face of a good sport who symbolicly reaches out with a congratulatory handshake and a 'gg' attitude. I am of the latter. I'd rather get on to the next match than plod along 'pushing wood'. For those of you who delight in winning a won game by figuring out the mate.......play the computer provided by chess.com.....it won't resign and will give you the pleasure of making all the moves you want to get to mate.

"MSNBC host Melissa Harris-Perry debut a new regular segment Sunday focusing on poverty, which she noted many people did not want to touch, even as the national poverty rate remained at 15 percent of the population last year, or just over 46 million people, with 21.9 percent of them being minors.
“Let me be crystal clear,” she said. “Those aren’t numbers. Those are people.”
President Barack Obama’s administration, Harris-Perry noted, has already at least broached the subject; days before his re-election, a campaign spokesperson cited programs like Choice Neighborhoods, Promise Neighborhoods and others in a response to The Nation as proof Obama took the issue seriously.
The magazine’s executive editor, Richard Kim, noted to Harris-Perry that the last presidential candidate to bring up poverty as a key point was former Democratic senator John Edwards (D-SC), who coined the phrase “Two Americas” to discuss it while running for the White House.
“I think there was a lot going on in the first administration: job creation, a lot of it was pitched toward the middle class,” Kim said of Obama’s first term. “I understand the political reasons for that, but morally, it’s just unexcusable [sic] we have the level of poverty we do in this country of vast, tremendous, splendid wealth.”

"How to write a code for PIC microcontrollers ?
If above question is in your mind then this Tutorial will help you in understanding the steps involves in writing a code for micro controllers , developing an electronic circuit and completing a project. We will call the electronics applications using microcontrollers and microprocessor as main processing IC unit as Embedded system. There are several definitions are available on Internet. But in simple words The Embedded system are those which use microcontroller as central processing device and some peripheral components are attached to complete the task.
Embedded system design is made up of two main aspects:
- The hardware
- The software.
In the early days of microprocessors and microcontrollers, The Embedded systems were designed and built up using a large number of integrated circuits (ICs). There were many limitations with those, one of the important is : Memory was very limited, so only small programs could be written.
But now the available ICs are more sophisticated and have enough memory to cope up memory issues. Now the designer had to do less to get a working hardware system.
With the advancement in IC fabrication technology, the complex hardware systems can be built up with comparative ease, and in many projects software development is now the main creative activity.
Thus our main focus will be on programming side. For learning purposes , it is always recommended that one should start with the Assemble programming language.
The embedded systems programs are written to run on a target system which is micro-controller in our case. You may be working with an educational PIC hardware system which will use PIC-16f877 and some other ICs attached with microcontroller.
we will use the Microchip MPLAB Integrated Development Environment, and the simulator in it.
What Programs Do and How We Develop?
The main ideas of computer programming may be many, but some of them are listed as under:
- A computer or microcontroller or microprocessor (any of these) has an instruction set. This set of instruction is the basics of programming. Once we select the device (microcontroller) to use and write a program for it, then the first job is find its Instruction set and understand it.
- The microcontroller can recognize each instruction and execute it, if it is properly used.
- The program that the microcontroller executes is a list of instructions drawn from its instruction set.
- It reads these in binary from its program memory. The program in this form (converted into binary language ) is also called machine code.
- To execute the program, the microcontroller works relentlessly through the instructions of the program, from the beginning to end.
- The microcontroller is ruthlessly logical and does exactly what it is told.
The Process of Writing in Assembly language program for microcontroller:
The programmer writes an assembly language program by using nothing more than a text editor. This process of writing code for microcontroller on a computer is often termed as the cross-assembler. The terminology cross-assembler implies that one computer is assembling code for one of another type, not for itself. Mostly the cross-assembler is shortened simply to assembler. The main job of cross-assembler is to assemble the program just written by programmer. This process is explained as, cross-assembler converts the program from assembler mnemonics into machine code ready to use for the microcontroller.
The Program Development Process:
The Program Development Process is consisting of following steps:
1. Write source code:
The programmer writes the program, called the source code, in Assembler language.
This is then assembled by the cross-assembler running on the host computer.
This is an optional step, if the programmer or user have a good simulator program installed on his/ her computer, then he/ she can simulate the code and if errors are in logic then these can be remove with making corrections in the source code.
4. Hex file Downloading:
When satisfi ed with the program, the developer will then download it to the program memory of the microcontroller itself by using a suitable hardware ( a stand-alone “programmer”) or universal programmer the hex file can be downloaded to the microcontroller, this process is also called burning of code into microcontroller.
5. Test in hardware:
The last stage is to test the program running in the actual hardware. This is likely to lead to program errors being discovered. Again, this may lead to changes being required in the source code.Tags:-pic programming pdf,pic microcontroller programming,pic microcontroller,pic programmer,pic projects,pic tutorial,pic programming software,pic programming for beginners,pic programmer software,pic 16c84,Parallel Port PIC Programmer ,PonyProg - Serial device programmer,Microchip PIC programmer Serial & USB,The Basics of Programming and Using a PIC Microcontroller,Free PIC programming software, Microcontroller Technology,WinPicProg Page,PIC, AVR, SX, 24Cxx PROGRAMMER,microEngineeringLabs, Inc. | In Circuit Serial Programming with EPIC,PICPgm - A free and simple PIC Development Programmer for Windows",en,reference

"A man shot by a Potter County deputy Tuesday after he killed an Oklahoma grandmother and attempted to abduct a woman and two children had an outstanding misdemeanor warrant for a bad check he reportedly wrote at an Amarillo strip club, court records show.
Records show a warrant had been issued for Gary Don Carner, who allegedly passed a bad $500 check at The Jungle Gentleman's Club, 4542 Canyon Drive, on Dec. 17, 2008. The warrant included two counts against Carner, one alleging aggravated theft by check and another alleging issuance of a bad check.
When contacted Thursday, management at the club said it reserves the right to accept checks from only three regular customers. Carner was not one of the regular customers, management said. Employees at the club said they could not remember Carner being there.
Authorities said Carner's crime spree started about 8:55 p.m. Tuesday when he approached a woman airing a tire at a convenience store near Soncy Road and 34th Avenue, authorities said. Carner, 58, asked the woman if she needed a tire gauge, then put a handgun to her neck and tried to force her into his pickup. The woman escaped and fled into the convenience store, authorities said.
Minutes later Carner followed Sharrel Blankenbaker, 63, of Felt, Okla., and her three grandchildren into the Love's Country Store at 14701 W. Interstate 40. When they came out, Carner tried to grab Blankenbaker's 12-year-old granddaughter. Blankenbaker intervened and struggled with Carner, said Potter County Sheriff Robert Thomas. Carner shot Blankenbaker in the back. She later died at the hospital. Preliminary autopsy results released Thursday said she died of the single gunshot wound to the back fired by Carner's gun.
Moments after the shooting, Carner came across two 11-year-old girls who were walking along Indian Hills Road, near one of their homes. He stopped his pickup and forced one of the girls inside at gunpoint. The other ran for help, authorities said.
Minutes later, a Potter County deputy spotted the pickup near Blessen and Jim Line roads. The girl opened the passenger door and dove out of the moving pickup into a ditch, Thomas said.
Carner's spree came to a halt when he opened fire on Potter County Deputy Steve White, who returned fire, killing Carner, Thomas said.
A preliminary autopsy report on Carner indicated that he died of a single gunshot wound to his torso.
The Potter-Randall Special Crimes Unit Sgt. Kevin Dockery of the Potter-Randall Special Crimes Unit said the shooting remains under investigation.
Dockery said toxicology results from the autopsies are expected sometime next month.

"Hardcore GTA fans, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised by all the goodies you'll get in the newly announced 'Special' and 'Collector's' Edition of the fifth installment of the transcendent video game series. September 17th will be here before you know it, if this summer subscribes to my theory that hasn't yet failed — every summer goes by fast. That being said, are you gonna cop GTA V come the fall? View the special's ($74.99) and collector's edition ($149.99) posters above and below!
Allow me to jump in on the fun 3.5 million views after the fact. Sorry, yesterday was a busy day. Yup, in just one day GTAV proves it's the most hotly anticipated video game on the horizion (Halo 4 and COD's recent releases help that argument) with an amazing 2 minute trailer of what we can expect.
And what can we expect? Short answer: everything and anything. Every action hero sequence you can imagine can be duplicated here. The graphics, the capabilities, everything looks pretty amazing. Still hazy on the storyline is going to play out but that detail will be sure to come soon. Same goes with how the gameplay's going to work. No doubt though that Rockstar Games will knock this one out of the park this coming Spring, 2013.
UPDATE: This official promo poster confirms the Spring, 2013 release. Get ready, GTA fans!
10.29.11: The latest word on the GTA V release date from Poland (yes, the birthplace of Chopin, Copernicus, and Pope John Paul II, that Poland) is the slightly vague and ambiguous ""spring, 2013"". That's what this website is revealing with the above leaked images of 'official' promo posters for GTA V. But we can't say for sure until we hear or see something official from Rockstar, vis-a-vis this recently revealed artwork below.
Whatever the case, just the mere sight of those four letters together (which is does not double as a word in Words With Friends, I've already checked) has me stoked for a new chapter of Grand Theft Auto.",en,web
"Informal Sector And Social Development In The Context Of Globalization
Globalization means different things to different people. In its broader sense, the term encompasses all types of economic and cultural transfer between nations. In a narrower sense it refers to the economic exchange of goods and services internationally and international financial flows. Globalization process was initiated to accelerate economic growth through enhanced internal and external competition, privatization and trade liberalization. It includes measures to reduce domestic credit expansion in general fiscal deficit in government expenditure in particular, and to divert resources towards relatively more productive private sector.
Global trade and investment patterns are having a dramatic impact on employment relations and work arrangements around the world. The impact can be both negative and positive and differs by context, by industry and trade and employment status. Some of those who work in the informal sector have been able to find new jobs or new markets for their products while others have lost jobs and markets. Many workers have seen their wage decline their working conditions deteriorated or their workloads increased.
In the wake of Globalization and resultant financial crisis employment in the informal sector has risen rapidly in all regions of the developing world and various forms of non-standard employment have emerged in most regions of the developed world. Even before the Asian crisis, official statistics indicated that the share of the informal sector in the non-agricultural workforce ranged from over 55 percent in Latin America to 45-85 percent in different parts of Asia to nearly 80 percent in Africa.
Globalization & Informal Sector:
There is no simple answer to this question as different casual factors at work in different contexts. The first set of factors relate to the pattern of economic growth. Some countries have experienced little or no growth or jobless growth. In both cases not enough jobs are created for all those seeking work. Many frustrated formal job seekers find employment or create their economic growth “high tech” growth- tends to create more high skill service sector jobs than lower-skill manufacturing jobs. In such circumstances who without the skill to compete for high tech jobs find work or continue to work in the informal sector. The second set of factors have to do with economic restructuring and economic crisis. During the periods of economic crisis, the informal sector tends to expand. This is because retrenched workers move into the informal sector when public enterprises are closed or the public sector is downsized.
The third set of factors relates to the Globalization of the world economy. Global trade and investment patterns tend to privilege capital, especially companies that can move quickly and easily across borders, and to disadvantaged labour, especially lower skilled workers that cannot migrate easily or not at all. To increase their global competitiveness, more and more investors are moving to countries that have low labour costs or shifting to informal employment arrangements. Further more there has been a radical restructuring of production and distribution in many key industries characterized by outsourcing or subcontracting through global commodity chains. The net result is that more and more workers are being paid very low wages and many of them have absorbed the non-wage costs of production. In sum, Globalization put pressure on low-skilled workers and petty producers by weakening their bargaining power and subjecting them to increasing competition.
Social Impact Of Globalization:
There is a link between working in the informal sector and being poor. Average incomes are lower in the informal sector than in the formal sector. As a result, a higher percentage of people working in the informal sector, relative to the formal sector are poor. Informal incomes worldwide tend to decline as one move across the following types of employment- from employer to self-employed to informal and casual wage workers to industrial out workers. The link between working in the informal sector and being poor as stronger for women than for men. A higher percentage of women than men worldwide work in the informal sector. Moreover there is gender gap in income and wages in the informal sector. This is because women worldwide are under –represented in higher income employments in the informal sector and over-represented in the lower income jobs i.e., casual wages worker and industrial outworkers. Even within the same trade or employment statuses.
Available evidence suggests that Globalization of the economy tends to reinforce the links between poverty, informality and gender. This is because global competition tends to encourage formal firms to shift formal wage workers to informal employment arrangements without minimum wages, assured work, or benefits and to encourage informal units to shift workers from semi-permanent contracts without minimum wages or benefits to piece-rate or casual rate arrangements without either assures work, minimum wages or benefits. Globalization can also lead to new opportunities for those who work in the informal economy in the form of new jobs for wage workers or new markets for the self-employed. However, the collaborative efforts on the part of grass root organizations of those who work in the informal sector with sympathetic representatives of non-governmental organizations.
Globalization And Its Impact On Women:
The benefits of competitive markets and other mainstays of globalization such as information technology have been skewed towards the elite minority of women. The markets, tools and rules of this global era have railed to relatively affluent women are able to take advantage of the increased opportunities for work that come with the influx of foreign firms. Conversely, poor, less educated and credit and rural informal sectors may not see many of the benefits of globalization at all.
Richer and educated women have gained from globalization, but the vast majority of women have so far been sidelined in the global system. The raising tide globalization has not lifted all women. As a matter of fact, globalization tends to increase income inequality between different sectors and groups.
In addition, it is expected that unemployment will increase due to downsizing associated with the race to become more competitive. Most of those loosing jobs are unskilled while their jobs are hired by highly skilled.
Women work in the informal sectors mainly means casualisation of work. That is to say flexible working hours often means greater insecurity, reducing in working hours and pay, changes in shifts, loss of national insurance benefit, loss of overtime bonus and loss of holidays, maternity leave, sick pay and pension.
In the era of globalization women entered the labour market in greater numbers than ever before but their work is casualised. World bank also acknowledges that “women workers often more vulnerable than men, disproportionately concentrated in low wage sectors or occupations and often segregated into the informal sector. Not surprisingly their relative position ha often deteriorated during structural adjustment.

"Now that Twitter has received a purported $15 million round to right the floundering service, the truth can be told. Nothing that has been said on or about Twitter for the last six months has any degree of veracity in the real world. Those of us in the blogosphere who have known the truth have been self-sworn to secrecy; those in the mainstream media who knew the sad story all along have been reluctant to discount the possibility that Twitter was the next Google. Google doesn’t care.
Most responsible for this conspiracy of hope are those like myself who continue to operate under the delusion that computers are magic. We see these machines as transcending the dirty details of jobs, responsibilities, the laws of gravity, space, and time — all that shit. We’re of the ’60s, that stupid era where poetry shut down the Thruway, where we went to the moon, where some suggest we never returned. We stuck flowers in the barrels of rifles, levitated the Pentagon (so high we couldn’t have noticed if it hadn’t), drove Nixon from office, stopped the War.
We were spoiled by this time, with all the music, the technology that the space race turned us on and in to, the continued illusion that we could invent the future during our lifetimes. Warhol was possible, the anti-artist, graffiti, the marketing (have it your way), the packaged tragedies, the Elvis impersonators. Soon (30 years) we became numb to the rush of time, sequenced into special reports, George Carlin monologues, backwards movies, the dot boom, the housing crash. Obama came, Hillary went. We hardly blinked.
Now it’s over. Twitter has arrived and it is so fragile it can’t keep its own heartbeat going. Twitter executives finally admit it: they don’t know what’s wrong. They’ve got it on heart bypass right now, all innocent and sweet, lying there in intensive care with wires and monitors beeping and platform vendors scuttling in and out with phony looks of concern, taking quick side glances at their iPhones as they wolf down sandwiches in the cafeteria.
Now the doctors come down the hall, their faces frozen in ineptitude and practiced grief. “Sorry,” they begin as an intern laughs inappropriately in the back. “Computers suck, they can’t really do anything. There’s no such thing as real time. We can’t keep more than 30 conversations going simultaneously. Why do you think we invented FriendFeed anyway, except to get Scoble out of the system long enough to find the Off switch?”
Twitter is a Ponzi scheme, a cruel hoax that threatens to revive the industry in the wake of the anti-trust settlement that destroyed Microsoft’s steady firm hand on the notion we could each have a computer on our desk. Apple made a valiant attempt to keep the game going with the iPod, preserving the inability to talk machine to machine under the guise of DRM and saving the record business, and Microsoft’s Zune seemed to prove Jobs was right to stop where he did.
But then Techcrunch came along and one maniac with a dog took over the industry and restored hope when all was gone. Suddenly the impossible became plausible once again, as media companies collapsed into blubbering pools of Gatorade-like sweat, sales people wandering Second Street panhandling to get their cars out of 4-hour parking. Live blogging spread like a cancer down 101 as startup zombies abandoned PowerPoint for Qik, Ustream, and a parade of corporate Foo Camp replicas.
Doc Searls moved to Harvard, Dave Winer became Harry Reasoner, the Gillmor Gang broke its solemn promise and came back again and again and again. Twitter.
The truth is computers and networks became fast enough to let us realize our dreams. Bad business, that. We’ve survived the ’60′s because of the myth that it couldn’t work, that we would never catch up, never achieve a velocity necessary to reach orbit. But we’re there now and Twitter represents the triumph of that spirit, the instant connection possible between us at any moment, in any number, at no cost. Information is free – uh oh. If all you need is love, and you get it – now what?
Perhaps the true beauty of Twitter is to leave it perpetually and confoundingly almost working. Let it go weeks, months, minutes up without a glitch, and then, randomly, with no discernible or measurable rationale, crash and burn, only to restart again minutes later without any fix possible in the interval. Only then can we get on with the magic, secure in our insecurity that Murphy lives, and with it, our aspirations, humor, and paychecks. Thanks, Twitter. We need you more than ever.",en,books

"Summary: Reverb Communications is shown to be closely connected to Apple, leading to great doubt about Apple hype
Almost universally, Apple is believed to be liked by its buyers, who are really just a niche in wealthy countries. GNU/Linux is still a bigger player than Mac OS X because GNU/Linux has a wide reach spanning many nations (see slide at the top). Remember that Net Applications is paid by Apple and Microsoft, which voids the validity of its numbers that are US-bent.
Apple’s “evangelism” activity is not news. Apple folks like Guy Kawasaki wrote about it openly and quite famously. So, watch the following new report which connects Apple to a “PR firm [that] has been getting interns to post positive reviews for clients.”
Reverb Communications is an extremely successful PR firm that claims to have “first party” and “personal” relationships with Apple.
Another interesting side-story here is about Reverb’s relationship with Apple. Now, we don’t expect Apple to have caught the bad behavior of one PR firm on the App Store’s reviews. That would just be ridiculous. But we were surprised to know that Reverb had worked with Apple so much.
There is more in The Guardian:
Astroturfing – planting fake support for an idea or product – has been around the technology industry for a long time, but new claims have dragged Apple and the iPhone into the mire. The allegations from CrunchGear are that one PR firm has been getting interns to post positive reviews for clients on the iTunes Store. It’s disappointing, and likely just the tip of a big, dirty iceberg: I’m sure that we’re going to see more examples turn up very soon.
This begs for some important answers. How much of Apple’s notorious “fanboyism” is actually paid for? Apple spends several hundreds of millions of dollars per year on marketing. And to quote a blogger, “Reverb actually works with Apple, having done at least one TV commercial for them. Further, at least one of Reverb’s referrals actually came from an Apple employee. [...] I’m pretty sure confidentiality agreements don’t cover illegal activity, and what Reverb is doing here at least borders on fraud. At the very least it’s patently devoid of any scruples, honesty, and ethics. And PR firms and the people that work for them wonder why they are sometimes viewed as less trustworthy.” █",en,web

"A 31-year-old man has been bound over to Adams County District Court on felony charges stemming from a standoff with police last month.
Damon Ferebee is charged with making terroristic threats, using a firearm to commit a felony and possession of a short shotgun.
Police said Ferebbee barricaded himself inside an apartment Jan. 2. Shortly after police arrived, they heard gunshots.
When Ferebee walked out of the building carrying a shotgun and got into a vehicle, police ordered him to stop. Police shot out tires on his vehicle to stop, and then shot him in the shoulder after he did not respond to the commands, police said.

"In the climax to a week of high-level debate over the U.S. role in Iraq, President Bush laid out plans for a “way forward” in a televised September 13 speech. Bush said 5,700 U.S. troops would be pulled out of Iraq by the end of 2007, and perhaps as many as 30,000 by mid-2008, leaving a U.S. force roughly equivalent in size to “pre-surge” December 2006 levels. A New York Times news analysis says the speech carefully addressed three distinct audiences—the U.S. public, Iraqi leaders, and insurgents—and says the address came as the final piece of a “highly orchestrated game plan to change the political debate in Washington.”
A major element of that “game plan” was congressional testimony by the U.S. commander in Iraq, General David Petraeus, and the U.S. ambassador in Baghdad, Ryan Crocker. Petraeus said achieving success in Iraq will be “neither quick nor easy” and Crocker conceded (WashPost) that the Iraqi government “in many respects is dysfunctional.” Both Petraeus and Crocker were, in fact, generally hopeful about the prospects for achieving U.S. goals of a stable, democratic Iraq in their highly anticipated reports to Congress on September 10 and 11. But the long term horizons they suggested for U.S. military involvement are bound to intensify debate in a Congress already bitterly divided over Democratic demands for a troop-withdrawal timeline. Even before the Petraeus-Crocker testimony in the House Armed Services and Foreign Affairs committees, lawmakers from both parties clashed (WashPost) over the credibility of their message. On September 11, they were challenged by Republican and Democratic senators alike to provide a more coherent plan (Reuters) for success in Iraq.
Petraeus said the security objectives of the 30,000-troop surge were largely being met, with overall violence down since last year. He outlined a troop drawdown scenario (FOX) that could result in a return to pre-surge levels by next summer, beginning with one Marine Expeditionary Unit (of about 2,200 troops) leaving Iraq later this month. Crocker expressed faith in Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki and other leaders to show the political will to achieve political reconciliation. He also found hope in the new engagement by many of Iraq’s neighbors—with the exception of Iran and Syria—and the United Nations in Iraq’s development. But the hearings did little to reshape the political landscape in Washington. Most Democrats are still calling for a more aggressive drawdown in troop numbers, while GOP lawmakers remain reluctant to impose a firm timeframe.
CFR President Richard N. Haass says the troop drawdown plan, coupled with reports of success in the surge, has “co-opted” the reductions argument made by Democratic leaders. He says “the administration has probably bought itself 16 more months of something that looks a lot like the status quo” in Iraq. A new poll indicates public discontent (WSJ) with the Iraq war has eased slightly.
Ahead of their testimony, a series of other expert reports seemed to lend evidence to opponents of the surge. A new National Intelligence Estimate cites increasing divisions among Shiite factions and mounting criticism of the Shiite-led government by Sunni and Kurdish parties. The Government Accountability Office finds that the Iraqi government has met three of eighteen political and military benchmarks, and has partially met four others. A third report, from a commission of retired senior military and law enforcement officers, recommends disbanding Iraq’s national police force, largely because of sectarian divisions. Further, an opinion survey released Monday by the BBC, ABC News, and the Japanese broadcaster NHK found about 70 percent of Iraqis believe security has worsened in the sections covered by the surge in the past six months.
CFR Senior Fellows Ray Takeyh and Steven Simon says the Petraeus and Crocker reports are “irrelevant” because “the future of Iraq hinges on the outcome of its raging civil war, not on any recalibration of U.S. military strategy.” But the Iraqi prime minister said Monday that U.S.-led forces had given a boost to the country, and that Iraqi forces are not ready (VOA) to take over security responsibility.
Some experts say a precipitous U.S. withdrawal is unlikely, and would strengthen Iran’s hand in the region. A day after testifying Petraeus and Crocker singled out Iran out for undermining security (BBC) in Iraq with weapons and training for militants. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice called Tehran a “very troubling neighbor.”",en,reference

- These following special characters modify the interpretation of search terms (use with as many other terms as possible to avoid slowing your search):
- * matches any number of characters, e.g. *pseudo*
- ? matches a single character, e.g. young?lus frank?
- ! negates the presence of a term, e.g. !new
- ~ matches all terms with the given stem, e.g. ~spear for spear, spears, spearing, etc.
- = match is case-sensitive, e.g. =Paris
- Query results are typically limited to 5000 records. Avoid general queries, when you can, that are likely to bring back very large numbers of records, e.g. searching for poaceae.
- Long running queries are automatically terminated, with no results returned.

"Cabinetmaking is a specialty area within the field of carpentry and building trades. This field of study includes basic woodworking as well as more advanced cabinetmaking and furniture-making techniques. Cabinetmaking can be done within a production, manufacturing environment, or as an individual artisan specializing in custom design and building.
SUNY Delhi offers a one-year Cabinetmaking certificate as part of the Carpentry and Building Trades curriculum. This certificate program can be taken by itself, or it can be combined with further instruction in Carpentry to yield an associate's degree. This program's objective is to educate students in both the theory and practice of woodworking and cabinetmaking. The program includes extensive laboratory hours during which students develop and practice the skills of the cabinetmaker.
Students who enroll in the Carpentry and Building Trades associate's degree programs have the option of including one or two semesters of woodworking/cabinetmaking in the second year of their program.
The job titles associated with graduates of the Cabinetmaking certificate program are:
There are career opportunities in residential construction, in sub-contracting, and in sole ownership of a cabinetmaking shop. Students who continue on for the associate's degree increase their options for employment in the carpentry and construction fields.
Graduates of the associate's degree programs also have options for further study at the bachelor's degree level. For example, the College of Environmental Science and Forestry (ESF) at Syracuse offers a B.S. degree in Wood Products Technology.
A related career option would be to transfer to a school with a Technology Education or a Vocational Education bachelor’s degree, which would lead to a teaching career at the high school level. In New York State, two schools that offer this degree are SUNY Oswego and SUNY Buffalo.

"It’s been nearly a year since I came back from England and the thing that’s probably the most terrible thing about that fact is that I haven’t really walked anywhere. For a year. Walking around in a mall just doesn’t count, and anyway, what’s the point of walking around a mall when you have a wallet that would resemble Kate Moss’ cranium if you opened it up and peeked inside?
I can’t afford the luxury of a gym – not even the dodgy ones you see in the movies where they have cockfights in the basement. Going for a quick run in the neighbourhood would be a cheaper alternative, but the problem comes in when the police have to identify my remaining body parts to notify the next of kin. Yeah, this is Jo’burg baby! Love it or hate it, you can’t run in it.
The point is, I haven’t exactly been very active of late, and when your primary function in life is sitting in front of a computer all day and the highlight of your week is driving down the road to Checkers for groceries, you are going to end up with a flabby, square butt. Things tend to atrophy, and then gravity takes over.
Okay, I’m probably lying – my trip to Checkers every week isn’t really the highlight, but it does come a close second. I also go to my mother’s at some point during the weekend, and when that happens, I invariably end up stuffing my face with Mother’s Food. So it gets worse.
During the week my lovely husband is fond of having chocolates, ice-cream and popcorn (not necessarily in that order) after supper in front of the television before going to bed. Naturally I participate in this tradition because I wouldn’t want him to feel lonely, eating all those terrible, terrible things by himself.
It’s pretty darn obvious from reading the above that I needed to make a bit of a change in the way I live. When I realised that I could no longer walk in front of the full-length mirror in the hall without my eyes closed, I decided something had to be done.
I’m not terribly large. I wear a size 10 (34). But the thing is, I’m really short. Like really, really, really tall to the negative power of 5 billion. Dwarves would be allowed on the roller-coaster before me. I’m 147cm tall (about 4ft 8in, I think). Twelve-year-olds tower above me. Ominously. That’s why, even though I now weigh 56kg, I still have to lose about 10kg to look proportionately normal.
To make matters worse, I’m naturally pear-shaped. I have hips that make Oprah look like a catwalk model. Well, in my mind, anyway. It probably looks worse when you’re looking down at them all the time. When I was around thirteen I woke up one day and boom! Hips for Africa. I’m still waiting for the boobs, fifteen years later.
But lately, when small objects started to gravitate to and orbit around me, I knew that the time for action had come. So, I started The Diet yesterday. So far, apart from a bit of muscle ache from jumping around in my lounge like an simpleton with a skipping rope, it is going pretty well, but it’s still early days yet.
When I start fantasising about biting Francois Pienaar dressed up as a giant Lays potato crisp, you might just see me standing at the traffic lights with a cardboard sign which reads: “will write Mills & Boon novels for lipo”. Please spare some change...
I have taken up the challenge from the indomitable Hamish and compiled a list of what I should have put in the fine print for my poor husband.
1. I expect you to eat my delicious curries and cakes and get fat during the course of our marriage, thereby rendering you unattractive to all other females, while I munch on lettuce leaves and develop a body that everyone, male and female alike, would lust over incessantly (that was the plan, anyway. If I grew taller by an extra thirty centimetres and looked more like a supermodel, less like a midget it might have helped, too).
2. Rule number one: I am always right. Rule number two: I am never wrong. Rule number three: if in any doubt, please refer back to rules one and two.
3. Any chocolate of yours left in the fridge will be eaten while you are at work.
4. There is absolutely nothing, and I mean nothing, that can persuade me to listen to Bala and Peru on Lotus FM. Same goes for watching Scandal!, WWE Wrestling and the Steve Wilkos show. If you insist on listening to/watching any of them I will cut you.
5. I am an obsessive neat freak and minimalist. I will take all the things you have left lying around and squeeze them into your cupboard, even if it means your life is in danger every time you open the wardrobe door.
6. Don’t expect me to do anything manly around the house, like oiling locks or changing light bulbs. Do I pay you to stand around and look pretty?
7. I expect you to listen to my incessant prattle about various things, such as how my mother’s neighbour’s daughter ‘s boyfriend’s uncle’s gynaecologist is being sued for malpractice and repeat it back to me at a later stage as and when deemed necessary by me.
8. If I want chocolate, even if it is midnight, I expect you to get in your car and go buy me some. Otherwise a sulk of epic proportions (due to low blood sugar) will follow. I shall be forced to demonstrate peaceably. In which case there is bound to be violence.
9. If you fail to remember my birthday or our wedding anniversary and make a big fuss of your lovely wife thereupon, the police will never find your body.
Lately I’ve been having a good giggle over Hamish’s blog and something he said today reminded me that we South African Muslims are stranger than fiction. So, even at the peril of mortally offending everyone’s sensibilities, I have made a tongue-in-cheek list of the different types of Muslims you get in this country. This is by no means an exhaustive list, so feel free to contribute to it in the comments box.
This guy wears pyjamas in public and has a long, usually unkempt beard. I’ve seen beards that could hide small mammals in them. Biologists could spend years studying what’s in them. I digress. He usually starts sentences with “Bismillah” and more often than not finds a way to justify his chauvinistic and warped opinions by quoting from an obscure Hadith or from allegorical verses of the Qur’an. Dariwallahs usually find it hard to sit down when speaking. Flecks of foam usually emerge at the sides of the Dariwallah’s mouth and large veins begin to bulge in his forehead and neck when he is riled up, and he usually gets riled up about everything. It’s often a good idea to keep the paramedics on speed dial and sharp objects hidden when trying to defend your non-jamiat approved view of a certain aspect of Islam. Won’t look directly at, speak to or save a woman from drowning because it might awake carnal desires and send him directly to jahannum. The Dariwallah often gets a hard-on from watching the Oprah Winfrey Show.
The Lesser-Spotted Niqabi
The Lesser-Spotted Niqabi is rarely seen in urban areas, and when she does make an appearance, she often seems to labour under the misapprehension that every woman she recognises, even someone she met briefly at a book fair ten years ago, will recognise her simply by noticing her veiled face and muffled voice. In the company of other Muslim females, the niqab comes off and the devil comes out. Possibly the wickedest group of Muslim women I have ever come across. The best place to observe her outside her natural habitat is usually at Adult World, where she can be observed furtively purchasing studded underwear.
Usually young and inexperienced, this boy is typically the son of a Dariwallah. He can be found in sheep’s Western clothing, having developed a severe distaste for his father’s kurta-pyjama from an early age. He normally has a short, neat beard and looks like the kind of boy you’d want your daughter to marry. Until he opens his mouth, that is. Taliban-Wannabe is obsessed with guns, killing people and defending Islam (not necessarily in that order) and often expresses a desire to go to Afghanistan to fight for his Taliban brothers, but will never really end up going. What’s in his pants is normally a disappointment and is the most likely to end up murdering his own wife and kids. Quotes incessantly from the Qur’an but is a notorious skirt-chaser.
The Beauty Queen
Strikingly beautiful, slim and intelligent, this woman is a sight to behold. Sadly, she knows it and will remind you of it every chance she gets. She likes to put millions of beautiful profile pictures up on Facebook so that her army of unattractive male “friends” can gush creepily about how much they would like to get her into bed pretty and amazing she is. She is also fond of updating her status with deep, intelligent statements in the hope that one day, people will like her for her brains and not her beauty. Usually has daddy issues and is cold in bed.
Not normally the brightest kid on the block, the Player relies on his good looks, pimped ride and the money from Daddy’s hardware store to get him by in life. The Player usually gets married before he develops pubic hair, more often than not to his first cousin in order to keep the money in the family, but doesn’t see that as an obstacle to pursuing his ambition: being the biggest slut on the face of the earth. He has been known in the past to get involved in wife-swapping activities with his Player friends and has a predilection for paying for sex with transvestites. The Player often has nasty personal habits and is most likely to get arrested in a public toilet with George Michael.
The Harassed Mother
The poor soul is worn out from having four to six children and spends her whole life cooking, cleaning up puke, lactating and changing nappies containing sloppy green stools. She lost her figure after the second child, doesn’t have time for makeup and can often be found snoring during sex. She hates her husband for being able to leave the kids behind and go to work. She has forgotten what the second-last kid’s name is and he grows up thinking his real name is Bhaiyya.
The Repressed Nerd
The Manhattan Wife is usually married to the Player. She knows her husband is a man-whore and sees more vaginas in a week than the average gynaecologist sees in a year, so the only thing she has left is his money. She would be hideous if it wasn’t for her regular visits to the cosmetic surgeon. Fond of Dolce & Gabbana, Louboutins and the South of France. The Manhattan Wife drives a gas-guzzling SUV that is far, far too big for her and wouldn’t know a prayer mat if someone flagellated her with one. Sandton City has given her VIP parking. Often has sex with random people and of course is no stranger to the wife-swapping phenomenon mentioned earlier. Manhattan Wife spends more time in rehab than out and has invariably had butt-fat injected into her lips.
The Sap will always work for a fellow Muslim because he has been made to believe it is his moral obligation to be enslaved for a fifth of his market-related salary. Can be typically found working seven days a week in hardware stores, supermarkets and for charitable organisations. Has no ambition and his only thrill in life is from sexually harassing dolly birds at the shop. The Sap thinks it’s his right to steal from his boss because he is paid so little. Is usually married to the Harassed Mother and also can’t remember the second-last born’s name without having to consult the birth certificate folder.
The Hardcore Thinker
The Hardcore Thinker is a woman that will nag and annoy any man or child unlucky enough to be near her to the brink of suicide. She is fond of overly sentimental and hardcore religious status updates and thinks her poo smells like roses. She can often be found lamenting that she is misunderstood. The Hardcore Thinker is very fond of drama and can be found to be stirring pots of shit in a variety of different locations simultaneously. She is not afraid to embarrass others. She tries very hard to give off the impression that she is a serious person who contemplates very serious things all the time. Quick to judge and lose her temper. If any man ever has the balls to dump her she will most likely take out a billboard ad to tell the world how he did her wrong and how small his penis is.

"|Taking morning dosis a little late
Sep 27, 2008
First thank you doctor for all the help you give to us. I'm in treatment for about 2 years begining with a viral load of 1000,000 and CD4 = 14, at the begining I was very strict with my daily dosis (combivir + efavirens), the results were good, became undetectable and my CD4 count was 180 in only 6 months of treatment.
I began to work, my working hours end very late at night and this semester I didn't listened to my alarm and kept on sleeping and took my dosis late, about 2 and a half hours late. I'm worried about developing resistance.... in my last tests I was still undetectible and CD4 was up to 300. But I'm still worried about that. thanks a lot Naira
Response from Dr. Frascino
Your medications, Combivir and efavirenz, have long half lives and therefore being several hours late (or early) is not going to affect efficacy or increase the risk of developing resistance. You are responding extremely well to treatment with your HIV plasma viral load plummeting from 1,000,000 to undetectable and CD4 count skyrocketing from 14 to 300.
If you remain worried about your morning dose due to your work and/or sleep schedule, you could talk to your HIV specialist about switching to Atripla (efavirenz, emtricitabine, tenofovir), which has a convenient one-pill, once-per-day dosage which you would take at night. Atripla is actually a slightly better regimen than your efavirenz + Combivir in clinical trials.

"Tell us about your forthcoming talk.
The title is ""Why is my laptop so dumb?"", or ""Why isn't it smart?"". Here it is, in front of me. It has more memory and more processing capacity than your average rodent, but it doesn't help me. It's a passive object. I have got to the point where if you give me a laptop that is ten times more powerful than this in terms of processing, memory and display, I can't work any faster. I can't output any more. I am asking fundamental questions, like why, when I type in ""Jane"", does it not immediately go to my wife instead of giving me, at random, another 100 Janes from my address book? Why doesn't it observe what I'm typing, what I'm working on, who I'm talking to, and go away and find me information pertinent to that stream of work that I am actively engaged in?
I can go onto Google and type ""Artificial Intelligence"" and it will come back with 37.5 million references in under .8 of a millisecond. It's very impressive, but very useless. It gives me the first 10 of those 37.5 million; how about giving me the top, most relevant, references, to the work that I am doing? Just that level of intelligence would make me a faster, more efficient, human being.
On top of that, I think that the whole interface is very poor. We're still using fingers; we can talk to computers, but we are nowhere near a conversational level yet. The big question that I am proposing is - why not? Here is a different slant; I now talk to audiences where I can remind them of that famous line in 2001, where HAL is being requested to open the pod base doors... ""Sorry Dave, I can't do that"". Here we have an intelligent machine in a movie from the late 1960s, predicting that in just over 30 years, we would have a conversational computer, and we don't. Later reference points include R2D2 and Commander Data, of course. Science fiction has been predicting intelligent machines for a long time. The AI community, back in the 1970s, said that HAL would be here in 25 years, and he isn't - and may not be here for another 25.
So, why are machines so dumb? I got some surprising answers, and managed to come up with a formula that demonstrates that processing power and memory are not the key features of a sentient being. It is the sensory capability and the output mechanism of an entity that really contributes much more to its intelligence.
If you take a selection of comatose human beings, people in a vegetative state and are kept alive by machinery, and put them through an MRI scanner and whisper something like ""Imagine playing a game of tennis"" to them, in around 60% of cases, their brain activity lights up in the same way that you and I would. Here we have people who are not buried alive, but entombed in meatspace. They can sense, they can hear, but have no way of reacting: no way of giving an output. The formula that I come up with ranks the ability to input and output information from an entity as the key element that defines the intelligence, not the memory and processing power. If we leap to the futurists and to people like Ray Kurzweil and the priesthood of the singularity, their calculations and projections are based on a very coarse product of processing power multiplied by memory. What I am saying is, that is not the key feature. The key feature that dictates intelligence, is input sensory capability and the output actual capability. The flow that I have produced does not predict an exponential growth in intelligence of machines, but much more logarithmic or, at best, linear growth which is a lot slower. The expectation that we have had in getting intelligent machines has been on the wrong hypothesis. The hypothesis has been an exponential growth in operating speeds, processing powers, and memory, will give us exponentially faster capability and an exponential growth in intelligence. That's not the case.
The implications are profound. If you have a look at the advances that IBM have made with Watson; it has gone from being a contestant in Jeopardy!, to becoming a professional medical adviser that is able to give far better diagnoses of human ailments that any human doctor. The real problem that for about the last 30 years, no doctor has been able to read and keep up with all the research development and the latest work in any field. Watson is able to access all of that infomraiton. If it can only get hold of all previous diagnoses, treatments, prognoses and outcomes, then it would be even more powerful. We now have an exemplar of a machine that we can talk to. and it will give us an answer better than any human being. That works in the medical profession, but I think that it will work in architectural design, civil engineering and construction, electronics, defence, and business management. We are seeing the arrival of the sentient machine, but from directions that we didn't expect. Some of the most challenging questions come about this way.
We live in a world that was built bottom-up. We started with small particles and the formulation of atoms and molecules, then things like amino acids, then organisms and then intelligent organisms. The result is a human being which has a physical and mental ability to inquire, discover and understand. That type of ecology works very well, but it is slow. We are now attempting a top-down ecology where we build an intelligence that has not had an experience of growth and learning. We build the knowledge in from day 1, and it's now going to learn top-down. That is very exciting, and humans will be augmented by this third intelligence of machines. Will this actually arrive as a laptop? It's unlikely, but in cloud computing, it's going to be available. Watson is being engineered to offer mobile access, because of the huge amount of processing that it requires. That will give you and I, as human beings, possibly the first step to a new working environment where we don't just talk to people... we talk to intelligent machines and we can work far faster.
If I can ask this machine a simple question and get a verbal answer, instead of having to type, search, sort, categorise, and rationalise the answers put before me, that will make me so much more efficient. The world is no longer a 1 or 2-dimensional place; it's an n-dimensional, multi-disciplinary place. In medicine, you have nuclear physics in there, chemistry, bioengineering, electronic engineering, signal processing, and so on. Medicine is, in itself, an epitome of our lives. No longer is life simple; no longer is it a single discipline that we are dealing with. It has become much more entwined and engaged. The arrival of Watson is the peak of development in medicine, and could eclipse everything else before it, including the discovery of antibiotics.
In terms of where we are now - in terms of consumer machines that do not understand - how much of where we have got to is the basis of very safe thinking... UI design and development ensuring that users get something back which they expect, in a decontextualised way? Has it led us down the wrong path?
I see technology as a series of cul-de-sacs. The telephone is a good example, a technology that turned out to be a cul-de-sac. You come to the point where you don't want a telephone on a piece of wire; you want to do new things. I have no doubt that this QWERTY keyboard will, in time, disappear, but we have had a love affair with this keyboard for the best part of two centuries. As a species and as individuals, we do not like change, especially if it is an uncomfortable one. Speech is a very natural thing, as is visual communication. Gesticulation is hard to replicate electronically, but talking to a computer, providing it is not stilted, is comfortable for people. Look at the success of Siri, and of Watson. It's one thing for technologists, futurists, scientists and engineers to enthuse about a technology, but when you get the end-user, the MD, enthusing about it, you know that you've really got something.
Do these ways of interaction also change how media are consumed: the WIMP-based way in which we use the web, for example?
Without a doubt. If you experienced MS-DOS, then what a revolution windows-based interfaces were. The mouse, and all of these devices that we now take for granted... to see a young child try to swipe the picture on a TV set is an example. All of these interfaces that I have around me, switching from one to another... the paradigm of using my fingers on the iPad is confused with the paradigm of using my laptop. I'm having to go a stage backwards.
We lurch forward as we exploit a technology to its limit. Windows is great, but I'm uncomfortable with 10 layers on my screen. On a physical desk, I spread things out. My screen is not big enough for that. Effective surface area is a big deal with interfaces that carry information, whereas our devices tend to have these dinky little screens.
Are we playing catchup with what we want? Decent consumer technology has historically been unaffordable, so are we now at a point where we can look at interfaces in a mature fashion, given that Siri, tablets and the like are now accessible to all?
The next phase is an interesting one. All of this processing power that we are carrying will shrink down rapidly, as we get into the cloud. The amount of processing power and memory that we need in the devices that we own, may well rocket downwards as we use more online. At the moment, the bandwidth is not available, but I have gone down from a quad-core MacBook Pro to a single-core MacBook Air, and I'm doing OK, but I need more bandwidth.
In one month, Apple ships hundreds of millions of devices. Running parallel to this is a manufacturing and distribution capability, the like of which the human race has never had before. It's not just that these devices are affordable, they are affordable in massive numbers. To sit here and say that with 7 billion people on the planet, we have over 6 billion mobiles and half of them are 'smart' enough to get on the web... that's quite remarkable. When you imagine that, during my childhood, there was one telephone box in the street, and there are 90 million phones for 60 million people in the UK... that's astonishing. However, the mechanisms are no longer simple; they are very complex. Our dependence on technology is driving demand, as are our human and commercial needs. The manufacturing and distribution capabilities have driven down the price point, and this feedback mechanism continues.
How do we move to this more sensory environment, how disruptive would it be to both consumer and business technology?
As we get AI that really works and is accessible, the difference between people and companies using this technology will be like the difference between two armies, one using a bow-and-arrow and the other using a machine gun. The advantage that it will give us is so phenomenal, that it will just be on that scale. It will be an entirely different world. I don't know that we can exactly predict when or what impact it will have, but it could be bigger than the Internet itself.
How should we start to gear ourselves up for these changes: cloud, Siri, Watson... we are starting to see this stuff take place around us. We are moving to a different method of digital interaction. That changes our view of what technology is: ubiquitous, and yet, somewhat ironically, more invisible.
My endpoint is: if a technology does not give me a return on my investment in time and effort, and improve me in what I can do, then I abandon it. Technology should amplify my capability.
The endgame really is James T. Kirk on the Starship Enterprise. The Enterprise has a rather interesting community; everyone knows quite a bit about technology. Everyone can stumble into an interface and get by. They can all use machines, but they are not carrying any screens themselves. They can talk to any screen, and we are heading towards this any-screen, any-interface world, where the smartest people will be able to wander up to any device and using it.
Presently, you find yourself with too many interfaces. You know that you have spent too much time on the laptop if you double-click the button in the lift. If I told someone 20 years ago that a car could have a mouse, I'd be called insane. But, a BMW 5 or 7 series have a mouse to control the car's interface. It's an awkward interface, but you can get by. You can just poke around the interface and it works... you just figure it out. The automobile interface itself has standardised on 2 or 3 pedals; the Model T had 5. The fun starts on the dash: the radio interface, the climate control, the steering wheel... all different. When you hire a car, you have to learn quickly and, remarkably, we do. Human beings get by. We have become very adaptable in a world of multi-interface on things fixed and mobile, but they will become far more conversational. In the same way that a car's core physical interface has become standardised, we will get to a point where the interfaces of our machines will settle down to be conversational, gesture-driven, and not involve a mouse or a keyboard.
How are you applying these thoughts into your own work?
I had a request from a defence company to give them a means of assessing 3 AI engines that were fed by thousands of fixed and mobile inputs, including people, communication channels, sensors, radar, acoustic systems and so on, and in process, make sense of it all, and then give hundreds of outputs. The combinatorial dimension to this is the Internet. It's so big that you can't run tests that check out every dimensional possibility of what these machines can do, so you have to come up with some kind of metric that's all-embracing while gives you some kind of assessment of the capability that you're looking at. Hence, I derived this formula; it led me on the direction of where we're going, what we're doing, and how it might impact the workplace.
It span off into areas such as direct communication from and into the human nervous system. I was once involved with work on implants such as pacemakers and brain stimulators, and the interference caused by radio systems. But, now there is another dimension: telepresence, AR, and so on. At one point, I was engaged with the US Air Force who were looking at flying aircraft by thinking. That technology is now used in some games consoles. There is also a need to help people to walk and to have better articulated limbs. Increasingly, we're looking at tapping into the human nervous system, which opens up a whole set of questions around where the organic entity finishes and machines start - if you can decide - and what it means to be human or machine. We're making inroads into human and machine communication that is brought together in a much more cerebral way than a tactile one.

"Partnerships and Alliances
Recognizing the importance of partnerships in achieving positive change, ICES has assembled a diverse network of stakeholders, associate scientists and representatives of provincial, national and international health care organizations to collaborate on research initiatives. This active involvement in external relations and stakeholder participation has created a forum for research excellence, policy debate and effective, sustainable change, while also expanding the capacity for research in Canada.
Over the years, ICES has strengthened its long-term relationships, while forging new alliances to support emerging areas of research. Some of our key partnerships are profiled below.
Clinical Epidemiology and Health Services Research Program
An enduring partnership exists between ICES and the Clinical Epidemiology and Health Services Research Program of Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre in Toronto. Established in the late 1980s, Clinical Epidemiology (CE) is one of four research disciplines at Sunnybrook in which scientists explore the causes, consequences and treatment of disease using a patient-focused approach.
The two organizations work closely together to improve the delivery of health care services and the treatment of disease in Ontario. This unique working relationship has led us to a point where many research projects are intertwined, faculty members have joint appointments, and special events are planned in unison.
In addition, ICES and CE collaborate to provide excellence in research training through an accredited Academic Program in clinical epidemiology and health services research for graduate students and fellows.
Canadian Cardiovascular Outcomes Research Team (CCORT)
The Canadian Cardiovascular Outcomes Research Team (CCORT), headquartered at ICES Central in Toronto, was established in 2001. CCORT is comprised of over 30 investigators from across Canada who collaborate on research aimed at measuring and improving the quality of cardiac care.
CCORT is led by Dr. Jack Tu, a Senior Scientist at ICES and leader of its Cardiovascular and Diagnostic Imaging Program. Initial funding for CCORT was provided by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) Interdisciplinary Health Research Team program, and the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada. CCORT is currently funded by a CIHR Team Grant in Cardiovascular Outcomes Research.
Findings from CCORT’s novel research are described in over 155 peer-reviewed papers, including the publication of two randomized controlled trials conducted on hospital quality report cards and the first ever Canadian Cardiovascular Atlas. As well, the work of CCORT investigators informed the development of the Canadian Heart Health Strategy and Action Plan, which was released in 2009.
For more information, please see www.ccort.ca.
Cardiac Care Network of Ontario
The Cardiac Care Network of Ontario (CCN), an advisory body to the MOHLTC, is dedicated to improving quality, efficiency, access and equity in the delivery of cardiac services in Ontario.
With the aid of a computerized patient registry, CCN coordinates the province-wide provision of advanced adult cardiac services to facilitate equitable, timely and appropriate access to care. The CCN patient registry includes cardiac catheterization, angioplasty, stent procedures, and cardiac surgery.
ICES researchers contribute valuable evidence-based information to help CCN guide the MOHLTC in decision-making for future service funding. This has included: extensive data analyses on past and projected trends for cardiac procedure rates; assisting in the development of a methodology to determine future Ontario cardiac procedure rates based on patient need instead of historical supply; and, evaluation and refinement of the CCN urgency rating scoring system to appropriately prioritize patients on coronary angiography waiting lists to reduce future mortality rates.
Chiefs of Ontario
The Chiefs of Ontario (COO) is a coordinating body for 133 First Nations communities located within the boundaries of the Province of Ontario. COO and ICES have recently entered into a Data Governance Agreement that enables ICES to carry out health-related analyses for COO and the First Nations communities that COO supports and for whom it advocates.
For more information about this partnership and how ICES can work with individual First Nations communities, see this FAQ.
Hospital Report Research Collaborative
ICES is a key research collaborator on Ontario’s hospital report cards, with many faculty holding joint appointments with ICES and the University of Toronto's Institute of Health Policy, Management and Evaluation.
Led by the University of Toronto, the goal of the Hospital Report Research Collaborative is to help Ontario health care managers support quality improvement and demonstrate accountability. This research collaborative develops reports on hospital performance using the balanced scorecard format. A broad range of sectors is covered in the reports, including acute care, emergency department care, complex continuing care, rehabilitation and mental health.
Sponsored by the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care and the Ontario Hospital Association, this work has resulted in one of the most comprehensive sets of performance measurement reports internationally.
Métis Nation of Ontario
In 2009 ICES began a collaboration with the Métis Nation of Ontario (MNO) to generate a series of chronic disease surveillance reports. The reports have focused on gathering Métis-specific data on incidence, prevalence, health services use and outcomes of common chronic illnesses that affect the Ontario population. Reports on diabetes, cancer and cardiovascular disease are available at the Métis Nation of Ontario website.
Studies on respiratory disease and mental illness and addictions in the Métis are currently underway as part of the ICES-MNO collaboration. The findings of these reports will help to inform the health priorities of the Métis people in Ontario, as well as to develop and deliver health programs tailored to their specific needs.
For more information on the ICES-MNO collaboration, contact Saba Khan at 416-480-4055, ext. 3891.
In addition to the partnerships detailed above, ICES has alliances with organizations such as:
- Canadian Cancer Society, Ontario Division
- Canadian Diabetes Association
- Canadian Institute for Health Information
- College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario
- Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada
- Health Systems Research Unit, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health

"I’ve been bandying a particular hypothesis about lately in terms of human evolution: strong recent selection for adaptive alleles will result in a fitness drag due to pleiotropic effects. In short, I’m working with the assumption that a new mutant which has significant positive benefits because of a phenotypic change is also liable to foul up other functional pathways. Sickle cell as an adaptation to malaria is a classic case of this; the fitness benefits of heterozygosity are great enough to outweigh the drag of a proportion of anemic homozygotes (this is a case of balancing selection via overdominance). Yesterday I commented on copy number variation in the gene responsible for amylase, AMY1. Last month I covered lactase persistence. The rise in frequency of lactase persistence and the emergence of sickle cell are recent, within the last 10,000 years. It also seems likely that some of the copy number variation selection was also relatively recent. We don’t know of any downsides to lactase persistence and increased copy number for AMY1, though it seems plausible in both of these cases there is some metabolic cost simply from producing greater quantities of the enzymes in question. But in any case, my conjecture is that given enough time these sorts of traits lose their fitness drag as modifier alleles emerge at other loci to mask their deleterious impact. I am basically describing the ascension of the adaptive peak through mutants of small effect after the initial “overshoot.”
That is why I was rather interested in this paper, Two routes to functional adaptation: Tibetan and Andean high-altitude natives:
Populations native to the Tibetan and Andean Plateaus are descended from colonizers who arrived perhaps 25,000 and 11,000 years ago, respectively. Both have been exposed to the opportunity for natural selection for traits that offset the unavoidable environmental stress of severe lifelong high-altitude hypoxia. This paper presents evidence that Tibetan and Andean high-altitude natives have adapted differently, as indicated by large quantitative differences in numerous physiological traits comprising the oxygen delivery process. These findings suggest the hypothesis that evolutionary processes have tinkered differently on the two founding populations and their descendents, with the result that the two followed different routes to the same functional outcome of successful oxygen delivery, long-term persistence and high function. Assessed on the basis of basal and maximal oxygen consumption, both populations avail themselves of essentially the full range of oxygen-using metabolism as populations at sea level, in contrast with the curtailed range available to visitors at high altitudes. Efforts to identify the genetic bases of these traits have included quantitative genetics, genetic admixture, and candidate gene approaches. These reveal generally more genetic variance in the Tibetan population and more potential for natural selection. There is evidence that natural selection is ongoing in the Tibetan population, where women estimated to have genotypes for high oxygen saturation of hemoglobin (and less physiological stress) have higher offspring survival. Identifying the genetic bases of these traits is crucial to discovering the steps along the Tibetan and Andean routes to functional adaptation.
It is an open access article. You are free to read it closely. Here is my own impression: the Andeans have more clunky “brute force” adaptations to high altitudes, while the Tibetans have some more subtle characteristics which are more difficult to smoke out physiologically (obviously your impression may differ). I suspect that the Andean physiological response is so easy to detect because it is not seamlessly integrated into the rest of their functionality. Evolution has had less time to work with the Andeans to streamline their adaptation so as to induce less stress in their system. Modern humans have been resident in Tibet for 2.5 times as long as in the Andes. Additionally, pre-sapient species likely had their own adaptations which could plausibly have jumped through introgression. And there is a final piece of the puzzle: I am to understand that the adaptations of the Ethiopians are even more cryptic than those of the Tibetans! This is what one would expect, as humans have been resident at high altitudes in the Horn of Africa for an order of magnitude longer than they have in Tibet.",en,academic

"Dietz, G. and Cullen, J. and Coad, A. (2005) 'Can there be non-union forms of partnership ?', Employee relations., 27 (3). pp. 289-306.
Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to explore a number of issues pertaining to the conceptualisation, operationalisation, feasibility and effectiveness of workplace partnership arrangements in a non-unionised setting. Design/methodology/approach – The paper discusses the most common definitions of partnership to discern whether scope exists for non-unionised forms. It then presents a detailed case study, based on 38 semi-structured interviews with 29 interviewees, inside a non-unionised company to analyse whether its people management arrangements conform with the definitions presented, and to examine the employees’ experience of those arrangements. Findings – The paper notes that most partnership definitions can accommodate non-unionised forms, if the arrangements for people management inside such firms meet certain standards on employee voice mechanisms and the exchange of mutual gains. The evidence from the case study suggests that its unusual policies and practices do conform with a viable model of non-unionised partnership – albeit with some reservations. The benefits and concerns are discussed in the paper. Research implications/limitations – The paper presents a credible definition and observable operationalisation of partnership for researchers to adopt. It encourages future research on the extent to which so-called “partnership” organisations, including non-union enterprises, comply and suggests comparative research between paired unionised and non-unionised cases. However, it is limited to one case study. Originality/value – The paper's primary value is in its extension of the partnership debate beyond its current “union-only ghetto” into examining non-unionised forms, as well. The case study is also unique in the literature as an example of non-unionised partnership.

"Where is Triss Merigold? begins after your first encounter with Letho. The events occur while playing The Assassins of Kings quest.
During The Assassins of Kings you follow Iorveth’s plan and you meet Letho, the kingslayer. The decisions you make at some point, have a direct effect on the main quest called Where is Triss Merigold?
Before your fight against Letho, a cutscene triggered. Iorveth asked you to give him his sword when Vernon’s men attacked. Later, you fought Letho who defeated you, but he mentioned that he is looking for Triss to teleport him to Aerdin.
Witcher 2 Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition Walkthrough: Where is Triss Merigold Quest Description
“Triss was in danger. The kingslayer wanted to grab her and force her to open a portal to Aerdin. Geralt rushed full pelt to Flotsam – every second was precious. A single heartbeat could decide the sorceress’ life or death.”
Witcher 2 Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition Walkthrough: Where is Triss Merigold Quest Walkthrough
No matter how you have played the previous part, the first objective is clear. You must reach Flotsam (accompanied by Roche if you betrayed Iorveth). The cutscene that starts when you approach the city is affected by your previous decisions regarding Iorveth:
If you helped Iorveth and gave him his sword, there is a massacre in Flotsam. A guard will stop you and you will have two options. Tell him that you will work for Loredo, and you will enter the city; or use the Axii Sign to make him open the gate. Enter the inn and you will hear Dandelion arguing with two men about some elven women. Fight them and help Dandelion, or intimidate them if you wish, then talk to Dandelion who will tell you that Triss went to see Sile. Your next stop is in Sile’s room, at the inn (second floor).
If you helped Roche to capture Iorveth, Loredo will throw a feast in your honor. Have a drink with him, then go to the inn and talk to Dandelion. He will tell you that Triss went to Sile’s room to see the megascope. Go to the second floor, and enter the room.
As you can notice, in both cases you will have to visit Sile’s rented room. When you get there, you will find a blood trail, and along with Dandelion you must look for clues. On the right wall, near the painting is a small hole. Examine it and you will find a peephole. Go to the next room and talk to Derae.
Derae will explain what she saw. Triss wanted to find out who was the person on the other side of the magescope, and she came in contact with Dethmold the wizard from Kaedwen. You can talk to Dethmold to find additional information about his king, and then you will return to Derae. Ask her what happened to Triss and you will start a new side-quest called Margot’s Disappearance.
Note: You should complete Margot’s Disappearance immediately, and then focus on the current quest. Notice that The Assassins of Kings quest updated after your conversation with Derae.
After you finish the side-quest, exit the inn and drink a Cat Potion. Follow the orange blood trail all the way through the forest and you will find Cedric near the waterfall. Cedric will explain what happened in Sile’s room. Cedric and Triss where attacked by a witcher who injured the elf and took Triss to Verge. Cedric dies in front of you, while Zoltan and Dandelion appear. Talk to both of them to activate two main quests: At a Crossroads: Vernon Roche and At a Crossroads: Scoia’tael.
Note: At this point you should complete all side-quests (except for the Mystic River), and save your game. Exit the game, and create a backup of your save file, because the decision you have to make in order to continue, is crucial. If you side with Roche, you will continue the game having him as your ally, but if you side with Iorveth, everything changes and you will see a different ending. It is important to know that you can pick only one of them, and all quests from now on will be different. If you create a backup, after you finish the game with one character, you will be able play it again with the other one, without having to complete the quests you finished up to this point.
After you create a backup of your save file, it is time to pick your next ally: Roche or Iorveth.
Act 2 – Following Iorveth’s Path
After The War Council quest, Where is Triss Merigold? continues with the following update:
“Further reading will tell you that Geralt accomplished a lot in Aedirn. He fought wars, killed monsters, obstructed kings and caused unhealthy arousal in sorceresses. You have to keep in mind however, that his priority was finding Triss. Sorceresses as all other women do, keep in packs. Thus, in his search, Geralt headed for Philippa Eilhart’s house. Unhealthy arousal, however, was out of the question in that case.”
You can continue this quest while playing Baltimore’s Nightmare side-quest. In this case you will find a troll, when you search for Baltimore’s treasure. After a friendly chat with the creature, you will find out that he saw a woman falling from the sky and he retrieved her bandana, but the item was stolen by the his wife. Your next goal is to retrieve the bandana by bringing the she-troll to her husband.
You will also come across the said female troll if you play the Royal Blood story quest, or if you simply explore the areas around Vergen.
From your current position (near the troll) go left and continue through the mountains but stay close to the left side of the pass. Eventually, you will reach two crossroads. Make sure you pick the right path every time, following the waypoint on your minimap.
Soon you will hear the sounds of a fight, and you will see some mercenaries attacking the she-troll. During the discussion you will have to decide if you help them kill the creature, or save the troll.
Tip: Try to save the she-troll if you can because you will gain a small advantage later.
If you decide to kill her, don’t forget to loot her corpse and retrieve the bandana. In case you show mercy, attack the mercenaries and focus your attacks on their leader (Adam Pangratt). Soon, they will give up, and you should ask them to surrender to Saskia.
Now, the she-troll will return to her mate and you will get the bandana.
Note: Your next goal is to show the item acquired to Philippa, but don’t return to Vergen if you didn’t complete With Flickering Heart side-quest, because if you do, you will fail to finish it. Focus on that quest first and talk to Philippa after you finish it.
When you talk to Philippa, give her the bandana and tell her everything you know. Continue the discussion and a cutscene starts showing a civilian telling you that the citizens of Vergen intend to kill Stennis.
Note: You will have to postpone this quest for now, and continue later, after you save/kill Stennis (Royal Blood continues now).
If you save Stennis, after the guards take him to the dungeon, return to Philippa and she will tell you that you have to travel through the mist in order to continue your search for Triss.
Make the necessary preparations, and then exit Vergen through Mahakam Gate. Cross the burned village and when you reach the first crossroad (you will see a small fire), turn right. Enter the green mist and Philippa will appear as she promised.
The next goal is to cross the battlefield, accompanied by Philippa. This part is similar to the one you have played at the beginning of the second chapter. All you have to do is to stay near the golden owl and take out the wraiths that spawn inside Philippa’s magical barrier.
When you reach the other side, Philippa departs and you must continue alone.
Push forward towards the exclamation mark on your map and you will come across a corpse carrying a small statue. A cutscene starts and you will be welcomed by Vernon Roche. Tell him that you are looking for Triss Merigold, and try to maintain a polite discussion, as you need Roche’s help.
After the dialogue you can opt to take one of the paths indicated by Vernon. The easiest way is to follow the left path, through the tunnels. Eventually you will reach the camp and near a fire you will see Madame Carole.
Talk to her, and pay the fee she asks, to tell you how you can get inside the camp. She will eventually inform you that the entrance is in the tent. Get inside and look for a trap door which takes you to an underground passage.
Follow the longest route, for additional items, and when you reach the exclamation mark, don’t get out. Continue through the tunnels. Make sure you explore every dead end because you will find multiple items that will help you from this moment on.
When you exit through the northern passage you will reach the beach, and you should turn left. Eventually, a guard stops you and you have to enter the camp unarmed.
No matter how you play your cards with Shilard Fitz-Oesterlen, he will sentence you to death. Fortunately, Ves and Roche appear in time and you will have to fight Shilard’s sorcerer, Vanhemar.
Combat Tip: Against Vanhemar, use the Aard Sign to stun him.
After you win the battle, Roche agrees to help you reach Henselt; but make sure you don’t leave without exploring the camp. Gather all items, and then follow Roche. When you enter Henselt’s camp, stay close to Roche and when he tells you, hide behind the crates to your right, until he distracts the guards.
Note: If the guards see you in the camp, you will die without a fight, so stay sharp.
When Roche leaves the camp, continue to remain hidden and behind the yellow tents you see to the right. Move towards your objective and in front of you will appear the only yellow tent with red stripes on it. It is Henselt’s tent, but it is guarded. Go behind this specific tent and use the Aard Sign to distract the guards protecting the king. Now, run back and approach the tent.
Enter to trigger the next cutscene and talk to Henselt. No matter how you answer the following questions, make sure you take the royal blood. Henselt’s guards will accompany you outside, and the Royal Blood quest ends.
Next, all you have to do is to return to Philippa and cross the battlefield to reach Vergen. When you enter the city, talk to her and get ready to complete A Matter of Life and Death.
Note: Where is Triss Merigold? continues and concludes in the third act.
Act 3 – Following Iorveth’s Path
As soon as you start the said chapter, you receive a new update for this quest:
“Geralt reached the ancient elven city of Loc Muinne. Ages earlier the sorcerer Geoffrey Monck had brought a group of human children gifted with spontaneous magical abilities here for training. Taught by elven Wise, the Sources became legendary sorcerers who aided the human pioneers. When humans had finally settled the continent they repaid their debts of gratitude by destroying Loc Muinne and slaughtering its inhabitants. The scenic city ruins now ironically played host to a summit of sorcerers. The Nilfgaardian delegation was also taking part, and the Black Ones had brought the kidnapped Triss Merigold with them. Pondering the fickleness of history, Geralt searched for any trace of the sorceress. Shilard Fitz-Oesterlen was the key to her freedom.”
After you finish For a Higher Cause! during the third chapter, you have the chance to save Philippa or to continue your search for Triss Merigold. The latter option allows you to capture Shilard Fitz-Oesterlen who will be your guide through the sewers.
Follow his instructions and exit the sewers through the marked gate. The ambassador will lead you right to the Nilfgaardian camp, activating a new cutscene. When the cutscene ends, kill all guards, then look around for a ladder which allows you to go around the blocked gate.
Fight your way through the Nilfgaardian camp and eventually you will have to defeat Renauld aep Matsen and more guards. First take out the mage, then the archers and the soldiers. After you clear the area, focus on Matsen.
Combat Tip: Push Matsen against a wall and land quick attacks combined with fire-based attacks (Igni Sign)
After you defeat him, search the camp for some stairs that will take you to the cell where Triss is imprisoned.
Talk to her about the Lodge then head towards the town center. You have all the keys needed to unlock the doors; therefore you won’t have any problems in reaching the marked spot on your map. When you exit the Nilfgaardian Camp, you will complete the quest and unlock a new one, called A Summit of Mages.
Make sure you complete all side-quests in your journal before attending the summit.
