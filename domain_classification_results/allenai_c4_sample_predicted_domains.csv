"""How many of your clients and friends know what will happen if they inherit a property in Spain?, Inheritance tax (IHT) in Spain is paid by the inheritors not the estate""
There is no treaty between Spain and the UK in respect of IHT so tax may be payable in Spain and the UK.
A Will does not solve the problem only eases the process, it does not save the tax.
The tax rates in Spain can range from 7.65% to 84% depending on the relationship of the inheritor to the deceased and the value of the inheritance.
Add legal and selling expenses in both Spain and the UK, and costs could easily top 45 -50%.

"i am sure, like me, many of you have numerous pj lyric snippets that float around in your head all the time. depending on my mood...what is going on in my life...whatever...it changes. sometimes, i may be mulling something over, and pj lyrics just keep playing in my my mind.....related to whatever thoughts i have going on at the moment.
what pj lyrics are you really thinking/feeling today?

I have just listened to Melbourne 1998 bootleg & the tag in Daughter has Ed singing ""Where'd mum go"" just cant get it out of my head.
I've had ""Daughter"" stuck in my head for 2 dayz!!!!!!!!!!
I went to my great aunt's funeral today and the minister read a few verses from The Byrd's ""Turn, Turn, Turn (To Everything There is a Season)"".
in my head ever since.
""My whole life... like a picture on a sunny day...oh my whole life like a picture on a sunny day""
How I choose to feel is how I am...I will not lose my faith, It's an inside job today.
I don't know if someone posted on this before but when you get a song stuck in your head..particularly when you wake up and it's there..it's likely a message from your subconscious mind or I believe your higher self or the universe (called a ""cledon"")..so if there's a song in your head, and you don't know why it's there, and you can't get rid of it..look up the lyrics and think on what they mean for you (only exception would be a really annoying song).
I didn't get the meaning behind many of the songs in my twenties but when I recently looked up some lyrics from ten and no code I'm blown away. I'm on a spiritual path I find so much meaning in the songs. I recently was looking at lyrics for No Code and what an enlightened man eddie vedder is/was at that time in his life. Present tense, sometimes, release... resonate with me so deeply.
I've had Garden in my head today.
Has anybody else read ""Donations to Clarity"" by Noah Baird? The author wrote a scene where the only dialogue between the characters was PJ lyrics. It was really amazing how individual lines were woven together to make a conversation with a completely different meaning than in the song. Amazing.
""All the rusted signs we ignore throughout our lives. Choosing the shiny ones instead.""
On the left the girl in red so innocent, never sheds her clothes even when she goes to bed. The type of girl responsible foriginal sin, can't help but wonder where and who she is.
Not quite Pearl Jam's lyrics but I had Ed's version of ""Throw your arms around me"" stuck in my head all day. Ohhhh ohhh ohhhh ohhhhhh ohhhh heeeeeeeeeeeeee.

"The Indian Rupee hit an all time low of 72.66 against the dollar in September. And while this happened, the country slipped into panic of the rupee deteriorating even more. This fear led to serious consequences. Businessmen went mad trying to buy dollars in the forex market before it plunged further, our imports became super expensive, and our investments started drying up. All of this in turn contributed to the rupee devaluation pushing our economy into an endless cycle.
The reasons for the rupee free fall are manifold (watch the video to know more) but the underlying principle is just one – the direct relation between the currency’s value and the dollar reserves with RBI. When the reserves deplete (like it is doing right now), the rupee value falls, and when the reserves are high the value improves. So if the government wants to rescue the rupee, every policy, and every action must lead to stopping the reserves from reducing or at least adding more dollars to the reserves.
But there’s little the government can actually do for that. Here’s it.
One of the core reasons for a dip in the rupee value is the outflow of FIIs (Foreign Institutional Investors). An FII is just like any other investor whose interest in a country’s markets depends on the profits he makes, aka the 10-year yield.
India received a lot of FIIs after the 2008 financial crisis when investors had huge sums to invest but no safe market. At that time, the Indian market was considered to be “emerging” with high yield rates and a good USD to INR rate (43.51). Since then FIIs have been attracted towards Indian bonds. And their investments helped improve the economy with more cash inflows and in turn better the rupee value. In fact, between December 2011 to February 2012, FIIs invested $13 billion and the rupee shot up by 6% to 49.07 from 52.17. Then again from July 2012 and September 2012, FIIs pumped in over $8 billion in the Indian market and the rupee jumped by nearly 7% to 52.70 from a low of 56.31 against the dollar.
But FIIs have proved instrumental in the past, they come with added external debt. Bonds literally mean that the government is asking investors for money to invest in development projects in India. Of course the government has to pay interest on these bonds and at any moment if the investor wishes to sell off the bonds, the government should have the money to repay the investor in whole.
A high inflow from FIIs means that a higher external debt. And in future if too many investors plan to pool out their money it will again affect the rupee. This system of foreign investments and bonds is just a cycle of slumps and peaks for the rupee.
This is exactly what struck the Indian rupee. Overtime, the American market bounced back and FIIs gradually started pooling out of India and into the US bond. In 2018, India lost FIIs worth $4 billion in just 6 months, the worst since the 2008 global crisis.
But the hope’s not done yet. Even though it’s a short term solution, FIIs can make a comeback this year. India still provides a higher yield (8.1%) than the US (3%) and the RBI can use this to convince FIIs to reinvest in our bonds. The only problem is the country’s unstable market, but previous RBI governors have managed to lure investors despite the instability, on hopes of higher yields in the next few years. This is exactly what former RBI Chief, Raghuram Rajan had done in 2013 and what YV Reddy had done in 1997 after the Asian crisis.
NRI bonds are as the name suggests meant for non-resident Indians. The system is similar to FIIs – which involves bringing in investments into government bonds. The only difference is that these bonds are sold to individual NRIs instead of big companies or institutions like in the case of FIIs.
The idea of these bonds is that NRIs earning in dollars will have higher capacity to invest in Indian bonds, and thus the government can urge them to do so. With a low rupee value, the NRIs can buy more rupees for each dollar giving them even more money to invest in India.
This will act in the same way as FIIs both positively and negatively – in improving the rupee value and adding to external debt. So this too is a short term solution.
The government through the RBI pays the cost of all imports at the end of each month. This is a regulated system which prevents the country from falling into too much debt by paying off all the money it owes on a monthly basis. Since all trade (import and export) is done using the dollar, the country is losing more rupees (Rs 70 for each USD) every month to pay off the import bills.
For a few months the RBI used its dollar reserves to pay off the import, but now even those reserves are depleting. And buying more dollars at this point is an expensive affair.
The best thing to do would be delay payment until a time when the rupee improves. In that case we’ll be spending lesser rupees to buy dollars to pay off our import debt than we’re spending now. Of course this would be sweet talking exporters into allowing us a longer payment period – a move which former RBI chief Raghuram Rajan had adopted in 2014.
The other best way to go is to reduce our dependence on imports. This can be done by raising tariffs to discourage companies from importing goods. The other plus side of this, though not directly connected to the rupee value, will be keeping inflation in check. You see a higher import cost will reflect the cost of the product for the consumer which will only raise up inflation.
So India has already raised its import duty on multiple goods. In July it increased tariff on 30 US products by 50%, and earlier this year it proposed to raise duty on another 20 US products by up to 100%. All of this of course also comes in reply to the US’s tariff hike this year (Trump’s move to strengthen his economy. Watch the video in this article).
But while all this is fine, is it really practical to expect an import reduction soon enough to rescue the rupee from falling even more? Because India so heavily depends on oil imports for its development that 25% of the total import bills go towards crude oil. So reducing imports is out of the questions. And with oil prices touching $68 per barrel, the country’s expense on oil is expected to shoot up to $100 billion by the end of 2020.
This can be done by selling dollars in the currency market. As discussed earlier, we need dollars to import and where else would the private importers get their dollars from? The government has dollar reserves, but private importers have to buy dollars separately to import. And this demand for dollars in the market can further devalue the rupee. This is why the RBI has resorted to market intervention on several previous occasions.
On June 28, it tried to stop the mad rush for dollar by selling it to private importers in exchange for rupees. The RBI has not yet disclosed how much foreign exchange reserves were spent on that day, but market observers estimate that the RBI might have spent close to $2 billion in the forex markets to stem the fall in rupee value.
And as of August end, the RBI had foreign exchange reserves of $400 billion. This figure is important because the government can’t afford to buy more dollars if it wants to maintain the rupee value. So in a market intervention, it needs to spend the limited reserved wisely.",en,reference

"Christmas is always at my home. In countless years past my parents arrive and my father’s gift to me begins as he takes over in the kitchen, stocks the refrigerator, and plans and prepares Christmas dinner. Which leaves me free to become completely absorbed in my love of ‘making Christmas’ in all the ways I do, including final batches of cookies, decorations, and making of gifts. Last but not least, I am the maker of the ritual Christmas turkey tetrazzini, usually with turkey meat from a small roasted breast just for this purpose. This year however I have a clear vision of roasting a whole turkey. I can’t shake it. Finally, a few days before my parent’s arrival, I find myself perusing the turkeys at the grocery store, and it doesn’t take but a minute to put the gorgeous fourteen pound fresh, naturally and sustainably raised bird into my cart. It is all completely beyond my control. Smile. Before I even get to the checkout counter, I have visions of this one bird giving to us turkey dinner, turkey tetrazzini, and turkey soup. I call my parents as soon as I get home and inform them of my plan to let this turkey be the heart of our meals for the next four days….
I’ve never brined a turkey, but my father always does and it always produces a moist flavorful meat. I consult google and find a plethora of brining recipes and settle on one that includes spices like fennel and pepper and tamari in addition to the requisite amount of kosher salt. The turkey fits perfectly into the large canning pot and after preparing and adding the brine to just cover the turkey, set it all on the top shelf of the refrigerator for the next twelve hours. About an hour before roasting, turkey is removed from brine and patted dry, rubbed with oil and seasonings, and put into a pre-heated 325 degree oven. When my parents arrive, the house is filled with the aroma of roasted turkey. We feast that first night on the fresh roast, a large pan of roasted carrots, parsnips, green beans, broccoli & brussell sprouts, and plain white rice, all made even tastier with a dribble of the hot pan juices. The holiday has begun.
This year, the tetrazzini is the main event of Christmas dinner. I’m not sure when this ritual began as it wasn’t something I grew up with. It’s simply the ultimate comfort food and somehow, no matter what our dietary habits during the rest of the year may be, we give it up to this deceptively simple casserole for the holiday. As with all great casserole type dishes, it can be prepared hours in advance and then popped into the oven just a half hour before mealtime. I always at least double the following recipe to serve a dozen or more people. Leftovers the day after are as coveted as the main event, so making extra is always a good thing! Prepare about two cups of the cooked turkey into bite size pieces and set aside. Melt four tablespoons butter in a double boiler and whisk in 1/3 cup flour until smooth. Add two cups broth (this year I use Imagine No-Chicken broth instead of chicken or turkey broth…makes it easier for the vegetarians to share the meal…) and whisk until smooth and thickened over the heat. Add one cup half and half, two tablespoons dry sherry, salt & pepper. Meanwhile, boil a pot of water for cooking 1/2 pound spaghetti al dente, rinse in cold water and toss with a little olive oil. In a large saucepan, saute a chopped small-medium onion, about 1/2 lb. sliced mushrooms, and 1/2 cup slivered almonds in a tablespoon butter until soft and fragrant, turn off fire and let cool a few minutes. Add the pasta to the pan and mix together with the vegetables. Divide the sauce in half, add one part to the turkey pieces and the other to the spaghetti/onion/mushroom mixture. Put the spaghetti half into a greased baking dish, make a big hole in the center and pour in the turkey half. Cover it all with about 1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese and a little paprika too if so desired. At this point, it seems like everything is swimming in too much sauce, but know that after sitting awhile and then baking, this dish is transformed into a rich, creamy, and irresistible texture with the most amazing unique flavor. It is such an indulgence, and so special at the same time as it is only made for this one meal each year. A little bit goes a long way, and a little bit is all we need to remind us of just how lucky we are to have this delicious meal in the company of loved ones. Served this year around a candle lit table with a roasted beet/apple salad, a tossed green salad, and a starter of ginger carrot soup, it becomes a colorful and memorable celebration.
Kathy, you certainly got a lot of mileage out of that bird! I enjoy the spirit of gratitude and warmth reflected in your holiday feasts. And 14, hmmm. Beautiful photo too. I brings me right into your hearth and home.",en,books
"This shop is almost like a wish come true – where excellent Thai food meets exceptional desserts. If you have been to Wisma Atria recently, you would have noticed the new Coffee Stars by Dao. This is known as Coffee Beans by Dao in Thailand (not to be confused with Singapore’s Coffee Bean), a café-restaurant with remarkable success and popularity in Bangkok.
Other than the delicious Thai cuisines, do not forgot about the desserts. We were recommended the coconut pandan roll ($5.80), which had a fragrant green spongy layer with sweet coconut corn fillings which showcased the best of Thai and Western desserts. The green tea crepe ($7.90) reminded me of a softer version of a kueh lapis, and the chocolate sauce poured on it sealed it as one of the best cakes I had in a long time.
I had the opportunity to visit their Thai location when in Bangkok and the food is fabulous!

"I have spent the last 30 years in both academic and private practice settings. During this time I have tried to best understand how to have passion and a meaningful professional while maintaining work life balance and financial soundness. This pursuit has been a challenge but has allowed me to learn and develop a practice devoted to helping other practitioners in achieve this result!
3) the best pay and benefits for this type of work.
Although this is a good start there is much more to consider than this. In accordance with this I have tried to design our The Institute for Personal Development, our private practice, in such a way that we can be most flexible to help co-create a practitioner’s life in a way that brings meaningful clinical work, work life balance and financial rewards under one roof. Remember, the work that you do will directly affect your personal life, and your family balance. Therefore, finding a practice which will assist you in this pursuit is an essential decision.
At the heart of the Institute for Personal Development doing the right thing for patients. This is our North Star! This means treating patients in an evidenced based paradigm! However, in order to treat our patients optimally is the corresponding understanding that if a practitioner is not healthy they will not be able to effectively treat their patients. Therefore, having a practice that honors the need of our practitioners of having work life balance is paramount!
They must have a culture that is supportive, caring and fun.
They must not be working to the extent that it interferes in their personal life in a significant way i.e. working unreasonable hours never working to the point where they are stressed.
They must have a culture that promotes personal and professional development.
They must have a mentor that lives these values and cares about them.
They must have an experienced physician / psychiatrist who can guide them in difficult clinical and medical legal situations.
The Institute for Personal Development has 9 locations. Frequently we are able to help clinicians work close to their desired location. We have multiple types of opportunities including all outpatient or consultation-liaison or all in-patient opportunities or combinations of all of the above. We are flexible in terms of hours worked, particularly for parents who want to be at home with their children during their formative years. We have excellent pay and benefits including BCBS PPO, Principal 401 K, option for vision, dental, and disability. Finally, there is the option for loan repayment without having to live in a rural area in addition to the option for relocation expenses when moving from out of state.
The biggest thing I have learned is that money truly cannot buy happiness. However, joining a practice which allows for a career path honoring the need for clinicians to have a balanced life while being paid well is why we most of our practitioners have been with us over 10 years. Many of our clinicians have been with us over 15 years and some over 30 years!

"Bhadrapad Purnima or Bhadra Poornima is observed on the Full Moon day during Bhadrapad month, mainly in Gujarat. Bhaadra Poonam 2017 date is September 6. Bhadrapada Purnima is also known as Ambaji Bhadra Purnima or Bhadrapad Poonam or Bhadarvi Poonam.
Ambaji Bhadra Purnima is dedicated to Goddess Ambaji consecrated at Ambaji village at the foothills of Aravali Parvat (Mount Aravali) in Banaskantha district. Goddess Ambaji is also called as Goddess Ambika or Amba Bhavani.
Ambaji Mandir has a significant feature – the temple has no idol of the Goddess inside it. Ambaji is represented with a triangle. In between the triangle there is a sign of Shree. This form of Ambaji is referred as Vishwa Yantra. Ambaji is one of the 51 powerful Shakti Peeths. There is a belief that when Goddess Sati was dismembered, her heart fell in Ambaji village. According to another legend, Lord Sri Krishna was celebrated his tonsorial ceremony in Ambaji.
On the day of Bhadra Purnima or Bhadrapadi Poornima, a large number of farmers attend the fair held at Ambaji shrine. They worship the Goddess with various stotras and mantras. They perform various cultural forms in the praise of Amba Bhavani to please her. The main cultural art forms include – Bhavai, a folk drama of Gujarat and the Garba dance, special and occasional dance form of Gujarat. Devi Saptshati, a prayer of seven hundred verses in the praise of Amba Bhavani is also recited in Ambaji Temple. A huge fair is also celebrated near the temple.
Bhadrapad Poonam is also celebrated as Indra Pournami in some other regions of India. On Indra Pournami, Lord Indra is worshipped.",en,reference

Even before the fires were out in Sonoma County, the scramble for real estate was on.
The destruction of approximately 5,000 homes in Sonoma County has sparked a frenzy that may sound familiar to people in San Francisco and neighboring areas: homes attracting multiple offers and selling within days at prices well above asking, often for all cash.
The median price of an existing, single-family home in Sonoma County jumped 4.7 percent between September and October and another 1.8 percent in November, hitting a record $660,000 last month. Compared with November 2016, the median price was up 14.7 percent, according to Multiple Listing Service data compiled by Rick Laws, senior vice president with Pacific Union in Santa Rosa.
Homes are also selling faster: The average number of days between the time a home was listed and an offer was accepted dropped to 45 in November from 69 in October. In November 2016, it was 67. These figures exclude condos and new homes, but new homes are also being snapped up.
At Skyhawk Reserves, a new development not far from the destroyed neighborhood of Fountaingrove, “we were averaging about three sales per month” before the fires, said Mark Cooper, sales manager for developer APM Homes. “Within two weeks of the fire, we sold out the remaining part of our subdivision, which was 20 homes.” Skyhawk homes, priced at roughly $1.2 million to $1.4 million, are similar to those in Fountaingrove; all 20 were purchased by former residents of the upscale community.
Aruna and Vivek Jayaraman signed a contract on a home in Healdsburg on Oct. 16, one week after their home in Fountaingrove burned down. The couple had been looking at that house before the fire and had considered offering less than the asking price, because it had been on the market a while. After the fire, the couple immediately offered asking price.
“It was stressful the first week, figuring out where we were going to live. You’d hear about a rental that was available and all of a sudden it wasn’t available anymore. Our insurance company couldn’t find anything. They offered to house us in Menlo Park,” Aruna Jayaraman said. That would have been impossible, because she is a doctor at Sutter Santa Rosa Regional Hospital and can’t be more than 30 minutes away when she’s on call.
The owner of the Healdsburg house “had an offer from an insurance company to rent it for a ton of money,” but he accepted the couple’s offer instead, Aruna Jayaraman said. If they were buying it now, they’d have to offer more than asking price, she said.
Sonya and Michael Sweeney are waiting to close on a home they purchased west of Sebastopol. They paid roughly the same price — around $1.26 million — they had paid for a home in Fountaingrove less than a year ago. But the new house has only 2,600 square feet while the old one had 4,000 square feet and a pool. The couple decided not to rebuild their previous home because by the time it would be done, their two kids would be in college and they would not want a big house.
Maddie Sweeney, 15 and her brother Nicky, 12, who lost their home during the recent fires, take a moment with one of their dogs before school.
She looked at other homes online and visited three in Petaluma, but everything seemed to have pink toilets, mold or other major flaws. “Everyone who had a problem house, it was like this is the time to unload that house,” she said.
There could be some truth to that. In Sonoma County, 357 single-family homes hit the market in November, compared with 288 new listings in November 2016, according to MLS data.
Realtor Sudha Schlesinger, who lost her home in northeast Santa Rosa, bid on a replacement home two days later a couple of blocks from her son’s high school because she wanted some stability for the 17-year-old. There were only three other offers on that home, and hers was accepted. “It was less competitive then” than it is now, she said.
Some fire victims were able to buy a new home quickly because their parents paid for it, Borrall said.
Others are using insurance money. Most policies provide separate coverage limits for a home’s structure, contents and additional living expenses such as rent and rental furniture. Because the fires were declared a state emergency, fire victims have up to two years to exhaust their additional living expenses. Normally these expenses are paid as incurred, but some fire victims have negotiated with their insurance companies to get them in a lump sum and used that as a down payment on another home that they may need to describe as a “rental” property, Laws said.
Schlesinger is warning prospective buyers not to go overboard. She had one client who bid on a home in northwest Santa Rosa priced at $549,000. Before the fire, it might have been worth $400,000 to $450,000. “It had 11 offers. We were at $560,000. The accepted offer was $635,000. I could not in good conscience tell my client to go that high. I said I don’t know if I can resell it three years from now (at that price or higher) when there are a lot of new houses” on the market, she said.",en,web
"Measures to reduce the influence of money on politics could win approval in cities and states across the country Nov. 8.
Even in a presidential campaign where both candidates are speaking out against the influence of big money in politics, it’s easy to be cynical about the prospects for reform. The failure of Congress to take even baby steps in the right direction is enough to dishearten even the most idealistic among us.
But there is hope for our political system coming from the grass roots. Citizens across the country may well turn the 2016 election into a watershed moment for democracy. Using ballot initiatives to skirt dysfunctional national and state legislatures, these reforms would enhance the voices of ordinary Americans and send a loud message to national politicians to stand up with citizens for democracy.
Here are some of the places where voters will have a chance to make their feelings known next week. Know about more? Email us here.
Last year, Washington got a D- on lobbying disclosure, C- on political financing, and C- on electoral oversight from the Center for Public Integrity. Voters decided to take action.
More than 328,000 Washingtonians helped get Initiative 1464 on the ballot to restore public trust in government by increasing transparency in political advertising, cracking down on illegal coordination between super PACs and campaigns, ending pay-to-play among lobbyists and contractors, empowering voters with an innovative small-donor campaign finance system, and strengthening ethics enforcement.
The initiative is led by a bipartisan coalition including the League of Women Voters and the Tea Party Patriots, along with 24,000 Represent.Us members across the state.
This conservative state, which has voted Republican in 18 out of the last 19 presidential elections, might move into the vanguard of the democracy movement this November. The South Dakota Anti-Corruption Act, Measure 22 on the ballot, is a comprehensive effort to combat corruption in a state that, according to FiveThirtyEight.com, has the fourth-highest political convictions per capita in the nation.
The Center for Public Integrity gave the state an “F” for electoral integrity, placing it 47th among the states.
Measure 22 would block lobbyists from giving secret, unlimited gifts to politicians, which South Dakota, incredibly, does not prohibit. Like the Washington state initiative, it would enhance disclosure and transparency, stop the revolving door of legislators and lobbyists, enforce existing campaign finance laws by establishing an independent ethics commission, and empower small donors.
Also echoing the inclusive Washington state campaign, supporters of the pro-Measure22 effort span partisan divides. One cochair, Darrell Solberg, is a former Democratic state representative; the other, Don Frankenfeld, is a former Republican state senator.
Maine has been a leader in clean elections since the late 1990s. Now, Mainers have the chance to lead again with a cutting-edge reform in the voting process itself, one with backing from both Democrats and Republicans: Ranked choice voting.
Ranked choice voting gives you the power to rank candidates from your favorite to your least favorite. On election night, all the ballots are counted for voters’ first choices. If one candidate receives an outright majority, he or she wins. If no candidate receives a majority, the candidate with the fewest first choices is eliminated and voters who liked that candidate the best have their ballots instantly counted for their second choice. This process repeats and last-place candidates lose until one candidate reaches a majority and wins. Your vote goes to your second choice only if your first choice has been eliminated.
If passed, ranked choice would apply to races for US Senate, House, Governor and Maine Senate and Assembly beginning in 2018.
In the CPI analysis, Missouri earned an F on political financing and electoral oversight, and D- on overall electoral integrity.
So citizens are campaigning for a measure to reinstate limits on campaign contributions that the legislature lifted eight years ago.
Ballotpedia catalogues some of the measure’s highlights: contribution limits of $2,600 to candidates and to $25,000 to political parties from any one individual per election cycle; direct contributions from corporations and labor unions would be illegal; candidates would also be barred from accepting funds from out-of-state committees unregistered in Missouri.
Gov. Jay Nixon, and Sen. Claire McCaskill, both Democrats, support the measure. So do Republican state Sen. Rob Schaaf, and Fred Sauer, the wealthy anti-abortion activist who underwrote the petition drive to get the measure on this fall’s ballot.
This Maryland county is fired up for reform. Contributors who live outside the county spent more than $1 million on county elections in 2014. Less than 5 percent of all money raised came from small donations by its residents.
To combat this, reformers have placed public financing on the ballot. If the measure is adopted, candidates who opt in are bound to accept only small donations from individuals, not corporations. Those small donations would be matched by public funds. The idea is to give politicians an incentive to spend more time with constituents of average means rather than wealthy out-of-district donors. Maryland has a similar program in place for the contests for governor and lieutenant governor.
The NAACP, the Sierra Club and the Communication Workers of America are among groups endorsing the effort. So, too, does Rep. John Sarbanes, a Democrat whose district encompasses part of the county.
Represent.Us members in the city are fighting to rein in in the power of lobbyists with Proposition T.
According to the San Francisco Chronicle, which endorsed the measure, the ballot initiative would put “some serious handcuffs on the pay-to-play world” by strictly limiting how much lobbyists can give city officials in campaign contributions and gifts.
Prop T also enjoys broad, bipartisan support, from the San Francisco Democratic and Republican Parties to Log Cabin Republicans, San Francisco League of Conservation Voters, and San Francisco Berniecrats.
Across the bay, democracy defenders in Berkeley are promoting Measure X1 to create a public financing system for the mayoral and city council races without raising taxes. Any candidate who pledges not to accept donations larger than $50 would get all donations from Berkeley residents matched at a 6-1 rate.
The ACLU, California Common Cause, the NAACP and former US Labor Secretary Robert Reich all endorse the campaign.
Around the country are other measures, as well: anti-corruption resolutions in the Illinois counties of Boone and McHenry; campaign finance reform in Multnomah County, Oregon; ethics reform in Rhode Island; redistricting reform and nonpartisan elections in South Dakota; and ranked choice voting in Benton County, Oregon.
In Washington and California, voters are asking their elected officials to press Congress to countermand the Supreme Court’s decision in Citizens United, which in 2010 further accelerated money’s takeover of American politics.
Amid all the democracy downers from Washington, the groundswell of democracy reforms continues to grow. Maybe somebody on Capitol Hill will start listening.

"I’m sure I’m not alone when I say that the first cocktail I ever fell in love with was a margarita. With so many different types and variations—not to mention the fact that they’re absolutely delicious—it’s no surprise that they’re the favorite cocktail of the US. I think what I find most interesting about the popular drink is how it never seems to be the same in any two places. On one end of the spectrum I’ve ended up with a bit of a stomachache after only one round, and on the other I’ve had nearly life-changing experiences. Of course the bartender never wants to give up their secret in these latter instances, but a recent discovery makes me think I’m onto something.
Ever had a margarita with Agavero Orange? You would know if you had. Assuming the person making it was willing to tell you anyway. It’s 100% blue agave tequila that’s been infused with pure agave nectar and essence of oranges. And, yes, it’s as amazing as it sounds. I tried it for the first time just a little while ago. I’m pretty sure I didn’t even finish my first taste before informing Joe that we HAD to use it for the featured cocktails at our next pool get-together.
If you were wondering if I had a tequila that we like to drink with our newfound beloved liqueur, we most definitely do (thanks for asking! ;). I think Gran Centenario (I personally prefer the Plata) pairs the best with the Agavero Orange, both in taste and the fact that I’m kind of in love with the look of both bottles. So much that I’ve been debating a little bit about whether or not to get new glasses to serve them in.
Anyway! I think I’ve probably talked enough about how excited I am about my new cocktail discovery. I’ll leave you with a couple of delicious summer recipes, but definitely let me know if you have a special favorite of your own!
Directions: Combine all ingredients in a cocktail shaker. Add ice and shake vigorously. Strain into a Tiki Mug over fresh ice. Garnish with Mint Sprig & Lime.
Directions: Combine all ingredients in a cocktail shaker & muddle. Add ice and shake vigorously. Strain contents of tin into a Margarita Glass. Garnish with Lime Wheel & 1 White Grape.
Agavero Orange should be enjoyed only by adults 21+. Learn more about the delicious liqueur on their site, here.",en,web

"The one-notch downgrade to BB+, S&P's highest non-investment grade, will nearly certainly force Africa's most advanced economy to pay more to borrow from its worldwide markets and possibly and may fall off global investors' radar screens.
Gigaba said that he would be acting with urgency to accelerate inclusive growth. We felt at that point it was not necessary to talk to them because we were not going to change the decision.
Gigaba said that he did not tell South Africans of the downgrade at a press briefing he held on Saturday, because he did not want to lose the trust of S&P, who he said had made known the credit downgrade in confidence.
South Africa's new finance minister, Malusi Gigaba looks on after the swearing in of cabinet ministers following a reshuffle that replaced Pravin Gordhan as finance minister with Gigaba along with various other ministers and their deputies in Pretoria, South Africa, March 31,2017.
The two will continue to meet in the coming days.
""We did not abandon radical economic transformation"" Moody's has said that it will not issue a credit rating this week as it had planned. On Tuesday, Zuma thanked Gordhan and his deputy Mcebisi Jonas for the smooth transition saying the changes would bring ""renewed energy"" to the Cabinet and the executive.
""We acknowledge that yesterday's announcement was a setback"".
Zuma says Gigaba will be going on an worldwide roadshow to assure investors, that while ministers have changed, the policies will remain the same. ""Despite our current challenges‚ now is not the time for despondency...we will act decisively as government in collaboration with our economic and social partners‚"" he said.
Another ratings agency, Moody's, announced on Tuesday that it has placed the country's creditworthiness on review. Ramaphosa called it ""unacceptable"".

hose who divorce indicates that young married adults under age 30 have been particularly exposed to the risk of divorce in recent years, and this holds true especially for women.
So is it fair to assume that the Goode Hypothesis is based on the idea that First only the rich can divorce and do so at there own rate Then it becomes available to the lower classes and so they begin to do it gradually as it is not immediately socially accepted despite being available. Then as it becomes common place amoung the poor the rich begin to see it as ""lowly"" to divorce and avoid it due to social stigma. Is that the presumed chain or are there other motivations that I am missing?

As sociologist Doug McAdam and others have explored, tactical innovation is crucial for movements over the long term.
Concerning the discipline of sociology, he described the dichotomy of sedentary life versus nomadic life as well as the inevitable loss of power that occurs when warriors conquer a city. According to the Arab scholar Sati' al-Husri, the Muqaddimah may be read as a sociological work. The work is based around Ibn Khaldun's central concept of 'aṣabiyyah, which has been translated as ""social cohesion"", ""group solidarity"", or ""tribalism"". This social cohesion arises spontaneously in tribes and other small kinship groups; it can be intensified and enlarged by a religious ideology. Ibn Khaldun's analysis looks at how this cohesion carries groups to power but contains within itself the seeds – psychological, sociological, economic, political – of the group's downfall, to be replaced by a new group, dynasty or empire bound by a stronger (or at least younger and more vigorous) cohesion. Some of Ibn Khaldun's views, particularly those concerning the Zanj people of sub-Saharan Africa, have been cited as a racist, though they were not uncommon for their time. According to the scholar Abdelmajid Hannoum, Ibn Khaldun's description of the distinctions between Berbers and Arabs were misinterpreted by the translator William McGuckin de Slane, who wrongly inserted a ""racial ideology that sets Arabs and Berbers apart and in opposition"" into his translation of the Muqaddimah.
In more than twenty years of running diversity-training and cultural-competency workshops for American companies, the academic and educator Robin DiAngelo has noticed that white people are sensationally, histrionically bad at discussing racism. Like waves on sand, their reactions form predictable patterns: they will insist that they “were taught to treat everyone the same,” that they are “color-blind,” that they “don’t care if you are pink, purple, or polka-dotted.” They will point to friends and family members of color, a history of civil-rights activism, or a more “salient” issue, such as class or gender. They will shout and bluster. They will cry. In 2011, DiAngelo coined the term “white fragility” to describe the disbelieving defensiveness that white people exhibit when their ideas about race and racism are challenged—and particularly when they feel implicated in white supremacy. Why, she wondered, did her feedback prompt such resistance, as if the mention of racism were more offensive than the fact or practice of it?

I LOVE LOVE LOVE this. It tells me you have a purpose to your blog post. You have an audience in mind and you understand the goal here is to communicate beyond the academy to inform a broader public. This is what public sociology is all about! Excellent!
This is the essence of sociology. And is the fundamental challenge to the logic of individualism and neoliberalism.
Isn't all sociology really about networks? Why don't we see them?
What it means to be poor, with many additions in the replies. It is a shame that people are made to feel shame for accepting help or asking for help. If your charity group is giving kids something for Christmas, that's great. But don't put them on the local news.
The Shouting Class -- people who criticize things as a way of life.
Thoughtful blog by Grete Howland, about being raised as an evangelical Christian -- and then discovering that it isn't for her.
For those raised in more liberal, free-thinking denominations, such as certain Episcopal congregations or the Unitarian-Universalist church, the religious molding might not be such a bad thing. In those cases, you might have been taught that everyone is unconditionally welcome in the love of God, that all belief systems are worthy of respect, that decolonization is mandatory practice, to have a community service mindset, and the basic lesson of self-reliance. These are examples of habits and traditions one might want to continue practicing, regardless of personal faith or continued church involvement.
I had been taught (1) to put my faith in God regarding everything--finances, relationships, and so on--and (2) that the way to deal with stress and pain was to pray for their causes to be gone. I was not supposed to change my thinking; God was supposed to change my circumstances.
I grew up in rural, Christian, white America. ... The problem isn’t that I don’t understand these people. The problem is they don’t understand themselves, the reasons for their anger/frustrations, and don’t seem to care to know why.
Since facts and reality don’t matter, nothing you say to them will alter their beliefs. “President Obama was born in Kenya, is a secret member of the Muslim Brotherhood who hates white Americans and is going to take away their guns.” I feel ridiculous even writing this, it is so absurd, but it is gospel across large swaths of rural America. Are rural, Christian, white Americans scared? You’re damn right they are. Are their fears rational and justified? Hell no. The problem isn’t understanding their fears. The problem is how to assuage fears based on lies in closed-off fundamentalist belief systems that don’t have the necessary tools for properly evaluating the fears.
What CAN change their minds?
Personal experience: knowing people from the groups they are prejudiced against.
At least, they’ve become unavoidable in class discussions even tangentially related to social psychology. In intro sociology, they lead to some interesting thoughts about lab vs. field experiments.

As sociologists, we study and teach about women’s devalued place in society. But the stigma against the romance genre is so strong that even our background as scholars in the sociology of gender wasn’t enough to inoculate us against the stigma. If anyone was going to know better, it should have been us.
Greyson and Lois establish the pervasive and deeply ingrained pejorative attitude toward the popular romance novel. Admit their own assumptions about the genre mirrored that of our culture.
Those with the highest degree of functional literacy aren’t necessarily those with the highest social status.
In precise contrast with school. In some ways, literacy is such a basic part of schooling that it’s nearly impossible to imagine other core skills (from numeracy to empathy) giving pupils and students any kind of social status outside of literacy.
Labov’s key text on the sociolinguistics of African American Vernacular English, with special attention to verbal eloquence (such as ritual insults, similar to Hip Hop taunts) regardless of literacy levels.
The two-party system, formal debate, and typical advice for essay writing all emphasize picking A or B, and then defending it to the death. We should place more emphasis on the identification of alternatives and the collection of objective facts.
We tend to assume that most people think and feel similarly to us. We then categorize those who don't as ""other"" and somehow inferior. This tendency is intensified when we gather with people who are in fact like-minded. And that happens in social media, where we tend to follow those with similar views.
I agree. But on the other hand, ""mocking a caricature of the Other Side"" is a description of satire, which seems to be a valuable way to spread ideas.
Stupid models are extremely useful. They are usefulbecause humans are boundedly rational and because language is imprecise. It is often only by formalizing a complex system that we can make progress in understanding it. Formal models should be a necessary component of the behavioral scientist’s toolkit. Models are stupid, and we need more of them.
Formal models are explicit in the assumptions they make about how the parts of a system work and interact, and moreover are explicit in the aspects of reality they omit.
Microeconomic models based on rational choice theory are useful for developing intuition, and may even approximate reality in a fewspecial cases, but the history of behavioral economics shows that standard economic theory has also provided a smorgasbord of null hypotheses to be struck down by empirical observation.
Where differences between conditions are indicated, avoid the mistake of running statistical analyses as if you were sampling from a larger population.
You already have a generating model for your data – it’s your model. Statistical analyses on model data often involve modeling your model with a stupider model. Don’t do this. Instead, run enough simulations to obtain limiting distributions.
A model’s strength stemsfromits precision.
I have come across too many modeling papers in which the model – that is, the parts, all their components, the relationships between them, and mechanisms for change – is not clearly expressed. This is most common with computational models (such as agent-based models), which can be quite complicated, but also exists in cases of purely mathematical models.
However, I want to be careful not to elevate modelers above those scientists who employ other methods.
This is important for at least two reasons, the first and foremost of which is that science absolutely requires empirical data. Those data are often painstaking to collect, requiring clever, meticulous, and occasionally tedious labor. There is a certain kind of laziness inherent in the professional modeler, who builds entire worlds from his or her desk using only pen, paper, and computer. Relatedly, many scientists are truly fantastic communicators, and present extremely clear theories that advance scientific understanding without a formal model in sight. Charles Darwin, to give an extreme example, laid almost all the foundations of modern evolutionary biology without writing down a single equation.
Twelve good uses for dumb models, William Wimsatt (1987).
To paraphrase Gunawardena (2014), a model is a logical engine for turning assumptions into conclusions.
By making our assumptions explicit, we can clearly assess their implied conclusions. These conclusions will inevitably be flawed, because the assumptions are ultimately incorrect or at least incomplete. By examining how they differ from reality, we can refine our models, and thereby refine our theories and so gradually we might become less wrong.
the stupidity of a model is often its strength. By focusing on some key aspects of a real-world system(i.e., those aspectsinstantiated in the model), we can investigate how such a system would work if, in principle, we really couldignore everything we are ignoring. This only sounds absurd until one recognizes that, in our theorizing about the nature of reality –both as scientists and as quotidianhumans hopelessly entangled in myriad webs of connection and conflict –weignore thingsall the time.
The generalized linear model, the work horse ofthe social sciences, models data as being randomly drawn from a distribution whose mean varies according to some parameter. The linear model is so obviously wrong yet so useful that the mathematical anthropologist Richard McElreathhas dubbed it “the geocentric model of applied statistics,”in reference to the Ptolemaic model of the solar system that erroneously placed the earth rather than the sun at the center but nevertheless produced accurate predictions of planetary motion as they appeared in the night sky(McElreath 2015).
A model that approximates some aspect of reality can be very useful, even if the model itself is flat-out wrong.
But on the other hand, we can't accept approximation of reality as hard proof that a model is correct.
Unfortunately, my own experience working with complex systems and working among complexity scientistssuggests that we are hardly immune to such stupidity. Consider the case of Marilyn Vos Savantand the Monty Hall problem.
Many people, including some with training in advanced mathematics, contradicted her smugly. But a simple computer program that models the situation can demonstrate her point.
2/3 times, your first pick will be wrong. Every time that happens, the door Monty didn't open is the winner. So switching wins 2/3 times.
Mitch Resnick, in his book Turtles, Termites, and Traffic Jams, details his experiences teaching gifted high school students about the dynamics of complex systems using artificial life models (Resnick 1994). He showed them how organized behavior could emerge when individualsresponded only to local stimuli using simple rules, without the need for a central coordinating authority. Resnick reports that even after weeks spent demonstrating the principles of emergence,using computer simulations that the students programmed themselves, many students still refused to believe that what they were seeing could really work without central leadership.
Alice Maz on communication failures due to different cultures of conversation and values.
Most people value feelings, shared perspectives, and social status. They see correction as an attempt to knock them down a peg. Nerds value facts, logic, and the sharing of information. A genuine nerd shares information with no intention of knocking anyone down, and prefers being corrected to remaining misinformed.
The fact that professionals prefer anecdotes from people like us over concerted efforts to understand a demographic as a whole is shameful. More importantly, it’s downright dangerous. It shapes what the tech industry builds and invests in, what gets promoted by journalists, and what gets legitimized by institutions of power. This is precisely why and how the tech industry is complicit in the increasing structural inequality that is plaguing our society.
Danah Boyd points out that people in the tech industry are far too quick to think of themselves as ""typical"", and ignore millions of Americans and billions of people who have little in common with them.
Can You Experience an Emotion If You Don't Have a Word for It?
Emotions are not just biological, but cultural. Different societies have unique concepts for combinations of feelings in particular circumstances.
If you know a word for an emotion, you can more easily recognize it, control it -- and perhaps feel it more intensely.
Emotions and how they are valued also varies across time as well as space. Sadness was valued in Renaissance Europe: they felt it made you closer to God. Today we value happiness, and we may value it too much. Emodiversity is the idea that feeling a wide range of emotions is good for you mentally and physically.",en,academic

Muscle Aches After Race or Training? Here Are 4 Effective Solutions!
If you exercise often enough, you will realize that no matter how many times you do, you will always get muscle aches after each workout. It’s your body’s way of saying they need some TLC, Tender Loving Care, after letting you rough house them.
Without proper care, your muscle aches can cause you to miss out on training days because the soreness will take some time to dissipate. Leaving it as it is without any form of recovery method will also cause your body to slowly break down and not be able to repair itself properly after each exercise. Thus, it is imperative to do something to remedy your aches and sores and to thank your body for a job well done. Here are four effective ways to do so.
It seems that the little fruit is not just big on flavour but also big on antioxidants. According to a 2010 study published in the Scandinavian Journal of Medicine and Science in Sports, antioxidant compounds found in tart cherries called anthocyanins are believed to be able to reduce inflammation. So the next time you pick up your bottle of post-recovery shake, try adding in some tart cherry juice for that extra boost to muscle recovery.
The next time you experience aches and sores after a workout, take a pack of ice from the freezer and apply it directly onto the affected area(s). As much as a hot shower will make us feel more relaxed, ice actually helps to prevent further muscle damage and speeds up the healing process. Wrap the bag of ice in a towel and leave it on the sore area for about 10 to 15 minutes to cool your body and ease the pain.
You can get these easily off any pharmacy counter and it works really well, especially for those who are constantly on the go and do not have a lot of time to take their post-recovery drinks or go for massages. Depending on how bad the pain is, you can decide how much of the gel you will like to apply on the affected area. However, do note that you have to rub it in to make it effective. The gel will provide a cool, tingling feeling which will numb your aches and sores for a period of time. Once the tingly feeling wears off, the pain will be magically gone too.
Runners adore massages! A full body session helps to keep us relaxed and also softens up our limbs and gets rid of any pain we may be experiencing in our muscles. Similar to a well-oiled machine, our body can perform better when it has been rubbed the right way.",en,web
"With only eight seats, the one-Michelin starred Tapas Molecular Bar offers an exclusive dining experience celebrating the art of innovative molecular gastronomy cuisine.
Situated within the chic Oriental Lounge on the 38th floor, the bar serves a range of delicious dishes in the traditional sushi-bar style, complemented by magnificent views stretching out towards the Imperial Palace and Shinjuku district.
During our visit, two chefs (one speaking fluent english) created and described in detail each of the menu items as they were being served, which combined new texture and flavour combinations to stimulate both the imagination and the palate. Some courses involved intricate tools to enjoy to its imaginative fullness, while others required instructions on how to consume it to ensure the best “molecular interaction”. The common theme however was that the food on the plate was never what it initially appeared to represent!
The two-hour dining experience was a lot of fun and the chefs kept the night exciting and were great showmen. The courses were creative and had the sophistication of a Michelin-starred restaurant; however, the fun factor of the molecular experience dominated over flavor, and while Tapas Molecular is definitely worth visiting for the experience, it’s not a place where I would return for the food alone.",en,unknown

"Whenever our local grocery store has something weird and wonderful in the produce section, we have to try it. This is how we learned about dragon fruit, rambutan and lots of other yummy treats. Grocery shopping really can be an adventure!
So when I came across cactus pears this weekend, I couldn't resist. You've probably seen them in pictures of cactus in the desert. They're all covered with spines on a tough skin, which is why they're also called prickly pears. When you buy them in the store, though, they've already been cleaned and had the spines taken off.
To make these yummy scones, I adapted one of my favorite pear recipes to work with cactus pears. Note: If you don't like seeds in your food, this is not the recipe for you. If you don't mind them so much, read on!
The signs were hung in the school office where all the teachers could see them. There were no cute pictures or crazy fonts to catch their attention. They weren't printed in glow-in-the-dark ink or matted on seven layers of coordinating papers.
The words were the important part.
And they were simple words. Give the students your best every single day. Give them the best instruction you can possibly offer. Give them every ounce of your wisdom because that is what's in your heart.
Students deserve the maximum effort a teacher can give every day.

"Online Safeguarding – who is responsible?
Another day, another online data leak. Yes we know, we really shouldn’t expect online storage to stay private any more… We are working hard to educate children, parents and the community. However Snapchat’s leak caught my eye because of one of the ‘facts’ that went with it. It said that around half of the users were under 17, sites seem to differ on the precise number but they all seem to agree that around half of the users are under 18. Therefore, for the purpose of child protection, and safeguarding they are children, vulnerable.
Think about that, this company knows that half of it’s users are under 18. It has recently been valued at over $10 million based on it’s potentially lucrative user base. What then does it have to do as part of it’s responsibilty to these children? I know what schools have to do, what youth groups have to do; the training; the form filling in; the checks. I also know what would happen if schools managed to leak data at the rate at which these companies do – and it would not be okay to say ‘but we told them not to use so and so…’.
What then do these companies have to do? It seems, nothing – it seems that it’s okay for a company to make a huge amount of money from children, and have no corporate responsibility to those children.
We must do something about this. There must be a way that we can force these companies to take some responsibility for their ‘customers’. A look around the internet and you find several examples of Snapchat in particular being warned about leaks and possible security issues. Facebook had similar issues, thought it is impossible to find out from any of these sites if they have any policy at all to the teenagers and children which use their sites.
Maybe the answer is fines, responsibility for the leaks. Maybe it is statutory guidance and training, and a names safeguarding laision officer. Perhaps they’d find a way to ensure all users were over 18 if legal action accompanies it. Maybe it is impossible without some sort of international guidance, but you cannot deny that these corporations are letting this happen, profitting from it and then walking away from it with no accountability at all. I really think we will look back on this era of child exploitative social media in horror.

"CV writing is an art that usually needs more understanding than the CV writer first thinks!
It doesn’t matter if you’ve got years of experience under your belt or are newly joining the workforce, your chance of scoring an interview is far more likely if you have an impressive CV that puts your skills, education and experience on display.
After all, a CV is often the first chance of a good impression you get to make and with a well-written professional CV, it could be one of many more to come.
Seeing that you’re already applying for the job, it should be obvious you want it. You can cover your desire for the role in your cover letter, or if you’re changing industries, it might be useful to add a brief introductory summary in the resume instead.
While mastering the art of sandwich making may have proved helpful for getting a job in high school, it’s time to delete that unnecessary clutter if it’s not related to the role you’re applying for. Give more space to detail about your present or recent jobs and less space about the past. If it doesn’t fit on one to two pages – it’s probably not worth writing about!
Recruiters only spend 6 seconds on average reviewing each CV they receive so any more than a few pages, and you’re wasting your time.
Make sure you highlight specific skills that are relevant to the job you’re trying to get, that will often mean adjusting your resume for each new application.
Leave out your age, religion, marital status and nationality.
This was once the standard in the past but is now illegal for your employer to ask you about, and there’s no need to include it as it has no influence on your ability to perform a job.
For security reasons, never include your date of birth, and never your bank account details… that might seem like common sense, but it’s amazing what we see applicants include!
As for an address, merely a suburb and state will suffice.
Use simple text using a modern, standard font that is easy to read, and that everyone can understand.
Modern means NO Times New Roman or Comic Sans.
As everything in your resume is about your experiences, avoid writing in first or third person.
For example, instead of writing “I handled a team of five”, or “Liz maintained a team of five” write “responsible for managing a team of five” instead, as part of your concise bullet points.
Avoid using over-complicated layouts with headers, footers, tables or other items that may not look right when viewed on different computers with various software versions.
Be sure to run a spell check to pick up any errors – a colossal mistake that is simple to avoid! On top of that, get a friend or family member to review in case there’s anything the checker hasn’t picked up.
There’s nothing wrong with using the same email address that you created when Hotmail came about in the 90’s, but if it looks unprofessional, (yes, that’s you sassygirl2000), it’s time to set up a new one… for job applications at least.
Never use your current work email, or phone number for that matter, unless you want to get yourself into trouble!
Above all, you won’t get noticed if you don’t follow every one of the specific requirements that have been instructed in the job advertisement. Often both resumes and cover letters are requested in a particular file format (doc, pdf, docx, rtt). Sometimes advertisements require applications be delivered or addressed in a specific way.
Choose not to adhere to just one of these, and you’ll be straight to the bottom of the pile.",en,reference

"8 km south of Fethiye Turkey, and near Ölüdeniz, hundreds of rundown Greek-style stone houses and churches cover a small mountainside, making the village of Kayaköy.
This fascinating town with its unique history has been preserved as a museum. Originally known as Livissi, Kayaköy was likely built in the 18th century and was were the Byzantine Levissos (Greek Christians) went to protect themselves from the pirates. At its peak the town had a population of 6,500 with churches, schools, pharmacies, a hospital, a post office, workshops and even a printing house for the Karya newspaper. Drinking water in the village was supplied by two public fountains and each house had a cellar and a cistern to collect rain water.
Up until 1923, Greeks and Turks lived in harmony under the rule of the Ottoman Empire but at the end of the Greco-Turkish War an agreement was made for population exchange: the Greeks living in Turkey would be sent to Greece and the Turks in Greece would be sent to Turkey. Kayaköy was completely abandoned and many of the buildings were also damaged in the 1957 Fethiye earthquake.
Today Kayaköy is a UNESCO “World Friendship and Peace Village” as a symbol of peace and friendship between Turkey and Greece and an archeological site under the protection of the Turkish government. Visitors can discover Kayaköy taking a dolmuş (minibus) from Fethiye or Ölüdeniz, walking on the narrow streets of the village, buying handmade goods from the roadside vendors and listen the whispering of the ghost town talk to them.

According to the planning application submitted to Longford County Council by the company, it is a “guyed wind monitoring mast, with instruments, 80m in height,” and its purpose is to “assess the suitability of the company’s adjacent lands for wind farm development.
When contacted by the Longford Leader, a spokesperson for Bord na Mona said the company is conducting tests in the area as part of standard exploratory works.
“The proposed mast is being erected as part of an initial assessment procedure examining the suitability of the lands for possible wind farm development,” the spokesperson explained.
However, the spokesperosn also emphasised that it does not mean Bord na Mona has definitive plans to construct a wind farm at the southwest Longford site.
“This assessment procedure is standard, exploratory work by the company and is not intended to infer any expression of intent regarding the future development use of the lands in question,” the spokesperson added.",en,web
"Founded back in 1870 at Mezzacorona (Trento) by the noblewoman Giulia de Kreutzenberg and the pharmacist Edoardo Bertagnoli, the multiple award winning Distilleria Bertagnoli specializes in the production of grappa and spirits certified by the Istituto Tutela Grappa del Trentino. This precious estate has been passed down and maintained for generations with passion and devotion.
The Distilleria Bertagnoli is located in the Piana Rotaliana Königsberg and runs its own production chain: from the selection of the grapes at the very beginning to the proper distilation of the raw ingredients to the bottling of the grappa and spirits. The ""pure hearted"" Bertagnolli grappa is full of perfections from the viewpoint of preserving and prioritizing only the best aromatic and sensorial components to create its top quality final product.
Tasting of two classic grappas from the Bertagnolli tradition. Choose between:Gran Grappino® Bianco, Gran Grappino® Oro, Grappa di Teroldego Trentino. The first two are best seller products produced from the very original recipe from the 1800's and representative of the business. The third option is a monovariety grappa of the Teroldego grape, a red grape native to the Piana Rotaliana with a blueberry and wild red berries aroma. For those who do not fancy grappa, one can choose to sample instead two liquors from the following: Liquore Mirtillo, Liquore Bombardino. Bread stick snacks will be offered to accompany the tasting.
This is a tasting experience that allows for the sampling of two white grappas (one blended grappa and one monovariety grappa), one reserve barrel-aged grappa and one grappa from the special Collezione Gran Riserve. To accompany the grappas, there is an offering of speck and local cheeses from Trentino. For those who do not enjoy grappa, there is the option to taste four liquors instead.
The monovariety Bertagnolli grappas are a tribute to the local land of Trentino and are produced from the double-boiler distillation of selected Trentino grapes including: Teroldego, Moscato Giallo, Chardonnay, Nosiola, Marzemino, Müller Thurgau and Gewürztraminer.
To celebrate its 145th Anniversary, Bertagnolli presents the Collezione Gran Riserve. Innovative design, rediscovered ancient recipes, elegant labels, long years’ ageing in small oak barrels. The magical synthesis of Artistry, Process, and Celebration. The story of Distilleria Bertagnolli, its important cultural heritage, and the uniqueness of the ancient art of distillation enclosed in every single bottle. With premium quality and refined taste, the Collezione Gran Riserve by Bertagnolli represents the noteworthy tradition of the Trentino Grappa in outstanding premium packaging.

"Note: This is the first in a two-part article. In the summer issue, we will offer ideas on using these rhythm instruments with children.
In September, Mr. Harris noticed how much interest his 3-year-old class demonstrated when he played music, sang rhymes, and offered opportunities to dance. The children clapped, swayed, and stomped their feet but seldom to the beat. After conversations with other teachers, revelations at a workshop, and a bit of research, he moved deliberately to introduce music—rhythm and beat—to the children in his group. His tools were inexpensive, easy to build, and engaging rhythm instruments that the children now use almost every day to reinforce music, literacy, and even math skills.
Over three months, Mr. Harris built a collection of instruments—shakers, sticks, bells, horns, and drums—all built from discarded or recycled household materials. He built the collection methodically and often invited the children to construct the instruments themselves.
The source of all sound is movement, scientifically called vibrations. While we can’t see sound vibrations (though we can feel and hear them), sound waves can be recorded and broadcast in an infinite variety of tones. Sound waves can travel through objects and travel best through solid objects made of metal or wood and less well through the air.
Frequency describes the rate or speed of a vibration in a given time period. Pitch corresponds to a sound’s frequency. In music, low notes have a lower frequency and sound slower or heavier, while high notes have a higher frequency and sound lighter, faster, and higher.
The degree of loudness of a sound is called volume. High volume intensifies and amplifies (makes louder) the vibrations. Volume can be loud or soft.
When sound tones are not related, we call the sound noise; when they are related, as in symphony, we call the sound music. Music is created by instruments that are designed to use frequency, the speed of sound vibrations, to control pitch—the high or low sound the instrument produces. In a stringed instrument, for example, loose strings vibrate at a lower frequency and produce lower tones, while tight strings vibrate at a higher frequency and produce higher tones.
Build your rhythm instrument collection with donations from families and friends. Let everyone know that you’ll be building a collection over time and will send notes with specific requests. Ask for specific materials to avoid a heap of materials that are too dissimilar to use. For example, a request for empty coffee containers may bring you different sizes of cans, jars, and bags, some without lids, and many dented or pierced. Instead, ask for 1-pound metal cans, with plastic lids. Focus on a single material at a time to avoid storage issues.
Some materials will be quite specific, so it may be useful to make personal requests. For example, if you know a woodworker, you might ask for ⅝-inch wooden dowels cut into 12-inch lengths.
Of course, you can buy many instruments from educational suppliers, but it’s good to save money when you can. For triangles, xylophones, and metal cymbals that are difficult to construct, check second-hand shops and garage sales. And always keep your eyes out for used instruments such as guitars, ukuleles, and autoharps. Take care to choose or borrow instruments that reflect the musical traditions of various cultures including maracas, African drums, and Jamaican steel drums.
Some instruments will demand adult preparation and sometimes even completion. But never pass up an opportunity to let children be involved in creating, personalizing, and building the tools they will use.
Learning to shake an instrument challenges a child’s coordination and dexterity. Maracas (small hand-held instruments that you shake) and tambourines (shallow, hand-held drums that you shake, rub, or hit with the knuckles) invite explorations of rhythm and tempo. Consider making a variety of instruments and encourage children to listen to the different tones each produces.
Traditionally, maracas were made of dried gourds filled with seeds and played for Carnival in Latin American countries. If you have a gourd garden, dry the produce to make authentic maracas.
1.	Invite children to place the funnel into the mouth of the bottle.
2.	Measure and pour about 1 tablespoon of pebbles into the bottle.
3.	Add confetti as desired.
4.	Run a bead of glue around the lip of the bottle and twist the lid into place. Allow the glue to dry overnight.
Make a simple version of caxixi (pronounced ka-she-she) shakers that originated in Africa and are often used in Brazil.
1.	Invite the children to pour gravel into the containers. Encourage social cooperation by having one child hold the container firmly on the table while the other holds the funnel and pours in the gravel. Remind the children that differing amounts of gravel will produce different sounds.
2.	Run a bead of white glue along the lip of the container and seal with the plastic lid. Allow the glue to dry overnight.
3.	Decorate the canisters with colored tape.
4.	Check the caxixi regularly to make sure the lids are sealed.
Variation: Instead of film canisters, use pint-sized milk containers, plastic eggs, or small plastic bottles. Add sand, pebbles, woodworking washers, or gravel noise makers. Decorate with appropriate collage materials. Encourage children to compare the sounds.
These are durable instruments but take time to build. School-agers will enjoy this week-long project.
1.	Cover work surface with newspaper or plastic sheeting to make cleanup easier.
2.	Pour equal amounts of water and white glue into a bowl. Stir gently.
3.	Tear strips of newspaper (about ½-inch wide) and put in the bowl to soak.
4.	Blow up a small balloon so that the widest diameter is 4 to 6 inches across. Tie closed.
5.	Cover the balloon with strips of newspaper, making sure all surfaces are covered and leaving the tied end free. Let dry overnight.
6.	Add additional layers of newspaper over at least three days. You will be able to feel the hardening surface and not a pliable balloon.
7.	Cut the cardboard tube into 4-inch lengths.
8.	Hold the hardened balloon knot side up. Place a tube over the knot and trace a circle. Cut out the circle and push the cardboard tube into the hole. Tape the tube in place to make the maracas handle.
9.	Pour about 2 tablespoons of gravel into the maracas through the tube.
10. Cover the tube opening with layers of colored plastic tape.
11. Paint the maracas and decorate as desired.
Buy or collect clean recycled aluminum pie plates.
1.	Place a pie plate, bottom up, on a pile of newspaper.
2.	Invite the children to decorate the plate with tape.
3.	Use the awl or a nail and hammer to make five evenly spaced holes along the circumference of the plate. School-age children may be able to do this for themselves; younger children must have adult assistance.
4.	Cut 8-inch lengths of twine, five for each plate.
5.	Thread the needle with a length of twine. String the twine through a hole in the pie plate and then through the top of a bell. Tie the twine in a secure knot.
6.	Repeat, adding all the bells to the plate. Place a drop of glue over each of the five knots and allow to dry overnight.
Variation: Test the differing results when you tie the bells loosely and tightly to the plate.
This instrument is easy to make with household materials.
1.	Invite children to decorate the bottom side of two plates as they desire.
2.	Place one plate on the table and put a few pebbles on it.
3.	Place the second plate, bottom up, on top of the first plate.
4.	Staple the edges together, placing the staples about 1 inch apart.
5.	Staple strips of ribbon around the circumference of the tambourine.
Show children how to shake the stick to rattle the beat.
1.	Cut the dowel into 6-inch lengths.
2.	At one end of the dowel, drill a ¼-inch hole.
3.	Cut the cord into a 12-inch length.
4.	Thread the cord through the hole and tie in place leaving 6 inches on each tail.
5.	Thread each tail with several buttons and beads. Tie a secure knot at the end of the tail.
Commercially made rhythm sticks are a mainstay of music and rhythm activities in early childhood classrooms. These sticks are usually 12 inches long and ½ inch in diameter. They are designed to help children identify and repeat rhythmic patterns. Purchased sets usually include one stick that is smooth and one that is ridged. The resonant sound of wood tapping on wood is easy to identify and follow. Rubbing the smooth stick along the ridged one produces a distinct sound.
Rhythm sticks are inexpensive to buy, but you can make your own as a simple woodworking project. Buy ½-inch diameter wooden dowels (usually sold in 36-inch lengths) and cut into four 9-inch long rods. Invite children to sand and oil (with a bit of mineral oil) the rods. Allow the oil to absorb overnight and lightly sand again.
Claves (pronounced KLAH-vays) are hardwood rhythm sticks, but better. Stout and short, claves create a deeper, more resonant sound when they are clapped together.
Show children how to hold the claves. Cup one hand and rest one of the claves between the base of the thumb and the ends of the fingers, leaving an open space in the palm. Hold the end of the second clave in the free hand and bring it down to tap the first. Holding the clave too tightly, or resting it against the palm will deaden the sound. The cupped hand lets the sound resonate.
1.	Shop for (or get donated) a wooden closet rod at a home supply store or resale shop.
2.	Measure, mark, and cut the pole into 6-inch lengths.
3.	Invite children to sand the pieces smooth.
4.	Rub the claves with a bit of mineral oil to seal; allow the oil to absorb overnight.
Variations of rain sticks have been found in Africa, South America, and China. They are played by tipping them back and forth. The pebbles falling through wire create the sound of rain.
1.	Cut the tubing or bamboo into 2- to 3-foot lengths.
2.	Seal one end with layers of packing tape.
3.	Cut the wire into five 12-inch lengths.
4.	Help the children loosely crumple the wire and gently push it into the tube, one piece at a time. Use a yardstick or dowel to push the wire into the tube, striving to space the wire bundles along the length.
5.	Pour about ½ cup of pebbles into the tube.
6.	Seal the open end with packing tape.
7.	Decorate the rain stick with collage materials and markers.
Make sand block clappers from pairs of similarly sized wood scraps. Purchased sand blocks are about 5 inches long by 3 inches wide and ¾-inch thick. Scraps of 2-inch by 4-inch lumber cut into 4-inch lengths will be appropriate for preschoolers.
1.	Cut the sandpaper to cover one large surface of the wood block plus 2 inches. If you’re using scrap 2x4s, cut the sandpaper into 4-inch by 6-inch lengths.
2.	Evenly spread glue over the back of the sandpaper.
3.	Wrap the block with the sandpaper covering one large surface and the two short sides. Let the glue dry overnight.
4.	Cut the nylon webbing into 4-inch lengths.
5.	Staple the webbing to the two narrow ends of the blocks for use as a handle.
Bells are enticing for children of all ages. Ankle bells stimulate an infant’s sense of hearing; older children can use them to investigate rhythm and beat.
1.	Cut lengths of elastic to fit the ankle plus 2 inches.
2.	Lap the ends of the elastic and sew securely.
3.	Sew bells to the elastic. For safety, use large bells (at least ¾ inch) and sew securely. Check the stitches before every use.
4.	Invite children to slip the bells over the ankles or place on an infant’s ankles. Encourage the children to move, shake, or dance.
Variation: Sew the bells to single-sided hook-and-loop tape. Cut the tape into 6-inch lengths. Leave 2 inches free and space the bells along the remaining 4 inches. These adjustable bracelets will fit either wrists or ankles. Consider making longer strips to fit the waist.
Ordinary clay flower pots make charming playground bells. Before you begin, identify a space from which the bells can hang either permanently or for the children to use for a specific activity.
1.	Check the flower pots to ensure they are free of cracks. Clean and dry each pot.
2.	Cut 24-inch lengths of twine, one for each pot.
3.	Tie a wooden bead to one end of the twine. Thread the other end up through the drainage hole. The bead will hold the upside-down pot in place.
4.	Repeat for the other pots.
5.	If you’re using graduated sizes, arrange the pots in order—smallest to largest. The smallest bell will have the highest pitch, the largest will have the lowest pitch.
6.	Tie the loose end of twine of each pot to the dowel or rod.
7.	Place the rod so that the bells hang free—between two chairs, across a doorway, or from an outdoor structure.
8.	Show the children how to gently tap the pots with a mallet to play the bells.
Note: School-agers will enjoy constructing this bell wall themselves. Younger children will need your close supervision and assistance.
Variations: Make the bells with aluminum cans and metal nuts or washers. Use an awl or nail and hammer to punch a hole in the center of the can’s bottom. Tie a washer to the end of the twine and a stout knot about 2-inches up from the washer. Thread the other end of the twine through the hole and knot again to allow the heavy nut to dangle as a clapper.
Horns and other wind instruments make sound using human breath. Good breath control and awareness of hygiene are required—help children personalize their instruments so that sharing isn’t necessary. These are best for older preschoolers and school-age children to investigate, construct, and use.
The kazoo makes its sound by vibrating with the human voice—specifically the humming voice making the waxed paper vibrate.
1.	Poke a hole in the center of one side of the cardboard tube. The hole should be about ¼ inch in diameter. Avoid creasing the cardboard.
2.	Cut waxed paper into 3-inch squares.
3.	Invite children to decorate the tubes in a way that allows them to identify their own instruments.
4.	Pour a shallow puddle of glue onto a saucer. Dip one end of the tube into the glue and then onto the center of a sheet of waxed paper. Secure the paper in place with a rubber band.
5.	Repeat with the other end of the tube. Allow the glue to dry for several hours. Then carefully remove the rubber band.
6.	Play the kazoo by humming (some children may need practice) into the hole in the tube.
Note: Kazoo construction encourages children to work with partners. Gluing and holding the waxed paper in place is awkward; show how one child can hold the tube and paper in place while the other stretches the rubber band to hold the paper in place until the glue dries.
Practice breath control with this simple horn.
1.	Show children how to use a soda straw as a whistle. Hold one end against the lower lip, tilt the other end downward, blow gently.
2.	Encourage children to vary the pitch of the sound by cutting small bits off the end of the straw. The shorter the straw, the higher the pitch.
Panpipes are a set of whistles that are played by blowing across the top, not into the horn.
1.	Prepare for the activity by cutting lengths of cardboard 6 inches long (across the corrugation) by 2 inches wide (parallel to the corrugation).
2.	If the corrugation holes are large enough, have the children push 6 straws through the holes, evenly spaced apart, leaving about 1 inch of straw at the top of the pipe.
3.	If the corrugation holes are too small for the straws to slide through, let the children place six straws along the bumps. Use wide packing tape to hold the straws in place again with about 1 inch of the straw exposed at the top and 7 inches at the bottom.
4.	Place the panpipe on a flat surface. To graduate the length of the individual straws, hold a straight edge about 1 inch from the straw on the left and 5 inches from the straw on the right. Draw a line across all six straws.
5.	Cut each straw at a different length with the longest on the right and the shortest on the left.
6.	Let the children personalize their panpipes.
7.	Show the children how to hold the panpipe vertically and to blow across the tops of the straws.
Show children photos of bugles, the simplest brass instrument. It has no valves or other mechanism to alter pitch; the player controls the pitch by varying the placement of lips and tongue.
1.	Prepare for the activity by cutting the vinyl tubing into 1-foot lengths with a craft knife.
2.	Mark the bottle about 4 inches from the top and cut. You’ll use the top, funnel shape to make the bell of the bugle.
3.	Show the children how to connect the tubing to the bottle top.
4.	Tape the tubing in place.
5.	Have the children personalize their horns with markers.
6.	Play the bugle by buzzing your lips into the mouthpiece. Make a buzzing sound by smiling with your lips closed and blowing out air through vibrating lips.
Drums, cymbals, and other percussion instruments exist in cultures across the globe. Invite children to play these simple instruments to set and maintain rhythms for dancing and marching.
Introduce rhythm instruments to toddlers with recycled (or donated) cooking pots and lids. Show babies how to tap on pot bottoms and clap lids together.
Make drums from mini metal garbage cans or large, industrial size food cans.
1.	Invite children to decorate the cans with markers or collage materials.
2.	Turn the cans bottom side up on the floor. Practice playing by tapping with fingers and hands.
3.	Make drum mallets by gluing yarn scraps over the eraser end of unsharpened pencils. Allow the glue to dry before using on the drums.
Simply, a drum has two parts—a sound box (a hollow container) and a skin (a tight cover for the container). The harder the sound box material, the greater the vibration and richer the sound. Timpani in an orchestra consist of a metal sound box and screws or a pedal that tightens or loosens the skin to change the sound produced.
1.	Make a drum skin by cutting the plastic bag to cover the opening of the bowl with a 2-inch overhang.
2.	Use the rubber band to hold the plastic in place, gently tightening the plastic around the circumference of the bowl.
3.	Turn the bowl bottom side up and run tape over the rubber band to hold the plastic in place securely. The tighter the skin, the higher the note.
4.	Invite children to tap the drum first with their fingers and then with a mallet or drumstick. Experiment tapping with the eraser of a pencil, the unsharpened end, or an end covered with yarn, fabric, or a piece of sponge.
Prepare for a parade with this big drum. Ask to have 5-gallon water cooler jugs donated for the purpose.
1.	Decorate the jugs with markers or collage materials.
2.	Turn the jug neck-side down and mark two spots 1 inch down from the flat bottom of the jug and across from each other.
3.	Use the hand drill to make holes on the two opposite sides of the jug.
4.	Use about 30 inches of cotton rope for the drum’s neck strap. Push one end of the rope through each hole. Shake the jug to free the two ends through the neck.
5.	Tie large double knots on the two ends of the rope and pull on the rope’s center to move the knots to the hole, securing the neck strap at each end. Adjust the length of the strap according to children’s sizes.
6.	Cut the dowel into 12-inch lengths for drum sticks.
Variations: Change the sound of the drum by changing the end of the drum stick. Cork, a wooden bead, sponge, fabric scraps, a rubber ball, and cotton balls will muffle and lower the sound.
No Cajun band is complete without a frottoir (pronounced FRO-twa) or washboard. It is often used as a substitute for drums in a band. The frottoir hangs from the front of the body and is tapped or strummed with finger thimbles.
A metal washboard is a treasured antique but may still be available at specialty hardware stores. As a substitute, use oven broiler trays or paint roller trays with ridged bottoms.
1.	Make shoulder straps for the frottoir by cutting cotton rope into two 18-inch-long pieces. Attach the rope straps to the washboard with tape. Alternatively, lace the rope through slats in the broiler tray or the ladder grips on the paint tray.
2.	Adjust the straps of the frottoir to hang loosely across the chest.
3.	To play, hold one spoon in each hand and rub up and down the metal ridges.

Many people use at home caregivers to provide services to their aging loved ones. It is more reassuring than other types of care and reduces the need for a nursing home. No one wants to spend a single day of their life in a nursing home! But, when you are hiring a professional to provide elderly home care services, make sure to do your homework first. Many caregivers are out there but they’re not all created the same. You want your elderly loved one to get the best care possible but you will not let this when hiring the first name that you find. Take the time to do a bit of research and ask a few questions before you hire and you can ensure that you get the best caregivers for your needs. Here are four of the most important questions that you should ask.
1- What Services do You Offer?
Many at home care services are out there and many offer services very different from the next. To ensure that you provide a caregiver capable of handling your needs, inquire of the available services before you hire.
Most people feel safer when they work with an experienced caregiver. If this is something that you also prefer, do not hesitate to ask about the length of experience the potential caregiver has behind their belt.
3- Do You Background Check Employees?
Do not use a company that does not background check all of their employees. The background check ensure that you are working with only safe individuals and without it, it is anyone’s guess who is in your home providing care to someone that you love very much.
4- What are the Costs?
Most at home agencies charge hourly rates but this is not true of all companies. Request estimates and always inquire of costs before you hire.
When was the last time that you really looked at your options in regards to your sleeping patterns?

When the HVAC unit is not properly working, it leaves Tampa residents hot and sweltering inside their homes. This is not an issue that you want to experience during the hot days of summer. But, there are many things that can cause the unit to malfunction and cause such conditions. One of the best ways to prevent these occurrences and the need for hvac repair tampa fl is by properly maintaining the unit.
You can take a few simple steps on your own to help better maintain your HVAC unit, but should also call the pros in to do their job, too. You can do your part to keep the unit working its best by regularly changing the air filters. You should change them no less than every three months and preferably, at least one time per month. Dirty filters cause the unit to work harder to produce air and may cause it to go back inside the conductor.
Make sure that you keep the HVAC unit clean. This includes the condenser unit outside of the home. Do not place any objects in front of the HVAC unit since this can also cause damages to the unit. And, of course, make sure that you respond to any problems quickly. It is not hard to tell when something is not right with the unit. Respond to those signs and get a pro on the job quickly.
A twice annual maintenance check is also recommended. When the pros come out and look at the unit, they can find any problems before they become trouble. They can also detect any strange or unusual sightings, wear and tear and other damage. This is an affordable maintenance check that is worth every penny that you spend.
Ah, the tools of trade, it’s really great when you have them. But every skilled, qualified and talented and talismanic artisan must have them. Otherwise how is he to complete his construction projects successfully and on time for his clients? They are professionals too. They are both domestic and commercial. Being professionals as well, they expect quality craftsmanship commensurate with the price they agreed to pay.
Fortunately for you, as an avid DIY exponent, or at least, a growing expert, there is no pressure to bear on you and you are under no illusions about the work in front of you. You have one enduring quality that is needed to do well in this domestic, but rewarding trade. You have patience. And you have tools. And you do not mind nipping over to the hardware store to scratch around for new implements that might just aid you in your next extensive exercise.
But gosh darn, you sometimes wish it could always be this perfect. Speaking of which, measurements across the board need to be perfect. Fortunately, you have one or two measuring tools that help. You and your partner would also very much love to see that all your pictures and photographs could be positioned perfectly all the time. Not to worry, because for that you now have the apt and perfect picture hanging level tool.
Oh yes, that’s right, you still need to purchase it. Gosh darn, how could we forget so quickly. Apologies for the enthusiasm and the rush to get on with it that usually comes with it. Your hardware store and even the downtown specialist art shop may not have this tool yet. But there you go, you can purchase it online.

"It was the first day of my final exams for the first semester. That morning. I was really nervous. I decided to go to school early because I was so afraid of being late and therefore lacking the time to answer the examination questions. But when I arrived in school, I told myself “Dani, iI hink you’re toooooo early for school!” It was just 9 and my examinations were scheduled at 11:30. I still had loads of time to review. So I went to CBTL Gateway to grab some coffee.
While waiting for the light to buzz I opened my reviewers, scanned my notes, and reviewed all the things that I needed to remember. Then my order arrived. I don’t usually get coffee for take out and for the first time, I experienced receiving a quote on my cup from the sweet little crews of CBTL. And you know what that means to me?

"ComicVine has a comprehensive list of Alien races and this got me thinking... what about a list of non-human races or groups who live on Earth? For example the Inhumans, the Atlanteans and of course Mutants. So I got to researching and created the list/concept of Clandestine races myself. I contemplated calling the concept Hidden Races at first but a lot of these groups aren't hidden at all - Mutants being the obvious one. Obviously these are only the ones I know so it would be awesome if fellow Viners started adding to this list and tagging it to comics as well so the list can really be comprehensive. Plus a lot of these groups and races haven't got wiki pages so there's a lot of work to be done and points to be gained!
Whilst randomly browsing through ComicVine (as I do on most days), I came across the Aliens Concept page. This is an informative page describing the role aliens have played in comics as well as listing alien races from major publishers. However there was no list of Marvel aliens! Of course being a Marvel fan (Marvelite?) I couldn’t let this injustice be! So I embarked on a project to research as many alien races and their major characters across the Marvel Universe as I could (be bothered to).
It took a few weeks but I’ve added a list of Marvel alien races, a major character from each race where I’ve found one, as well as links to the alien races and characters where available. I’ve also created both team and character pages for many of the races and key characters (listed below). Additionally I’ve also come across numerous pages that were created as “characters” but should have been “teams”. I’ve recreated these correctly and listed the incorrect ones as DUPEs. I’ll post these on the Dupe forum shortly.
As I’m mainly reading Silver Age stuff at the moment, most of the new pages I’ve created and listed on the Aliens Concept page are from Tales of Suspense, Silver Surfer v1, Tales To Astonish and Captain Marvel v1. Undoubtedly there are many lesser know alien races, especially from the Modern Age, that I’ll have missed.
Now it’s up to fellow Viners to add aliens (Marvel, DC or otherwise) to this page so we can make it really comprehensive. Also the two lists below are of recently created pages and they’re just waiting to give you wiki points so get cracking!
I’ve also found a number of other aliens but couldn’t find out what they or their race were called. Anyone know who the alien race are in the back up story in Silver Surfer #6?

"Beneath the surface lies a past I recognize. It is a pulsating beat, the rhythm of a force field, the web of a thousand spiders glimmering under moonlight. It is more familiar than my husband. Where did it begin and how will it end? Stemming from the cavity I call subconscious wisdom, I am fully aware that I am in The Struggle.
The presence haunts me because it is a call to action. One moment I think its humility and the next I think humiliation. Is it the same thing?
I’m riding a roller coaster. Below my feet, the rumble is the steady. I belong to one destiny. It’s as if hands have already molded me and I’ve awakened to discover I am a sculpture being chiseled out from the mountain that is my surrender. Surrender to who or to what exactly?
I confuse God with the Devil these days. I thought they were two separate entities but now I know that each is the side of the other, both intertwined and engaged in the primordial struggle that is both inside and outside me. Either way, I am thirsty for it now that I know I don’t have to push passion aside to be good.
I recall the moment I realized I was no longer in possession of my soul. I could see the shadow behind him in my dream. He had many arms writhing this way and that, like the Indian Goddess Kali. They say Kali is the Goddess of Destruction, but the Destruction of the Ego is what she means. His legs were crossed at the ankles, which made him innocent and vulnerable but not in a child-like way, but rather the kind of softness a man develops after being devoured by demons but lives to survive. Like Kali, he is soft, but in an instant can be taut like a black whip.
There was nothing transparent about that first moment, and yet—I was being exposed to more truth than I had in a decade.
Shortly after that moment, my life became more fiction than fact. I know now this is a stage of the soul.",en,books

Spring Camp dates are twice per week the last three weeks of the school year. Attendance is not mandatory, but we do encourage all students to attend as many rehearsals as possible.
Springcamp dates are announced through middle school band directors and are available on the JHS Band Calendar.
Students should wear comfortable clothing to Spring rehearsals. All students who join the Spirit of Jupiter Marching Band will receive an “official” practice uniform of two white t-shirts and one pair of green or black mesh athletic shorts, both with JHS Band logo. Additional rehearsal attire is the responsibility of the student. For more information about marching band uniforms and appropriate attire, please see our Uniforms page.

"Diets | Healthy Foods | Vitamins: Regular Exercise Keeps You Looking Young As You Age!
Regular Exercise Keeps You Looking Young As You Age!
Everyone grows older with each passing year, but not everyone ages in the same way, nor do everyone want to look their age. Some people are blessed with youthful looks, perhaps due to good genes, and others perhaps due good habit. And there are those that age faster than their years, and use modern science to battle and rectify age spots, sagging facial skin and varicose veins.
How can we account for these differences between people? And can we do something about it?
Well, doctors suggest that is it a combination of nature and nurture at play. It is true that some people have inherited good genes, but as anti-aging studies with twins show, the nurture aspect plays a big role too. Exposure to sun, the amount of free radicals in your body, and environmental pollutants can affect the rate of which your cells age.
Aging is another way to say cellular failure. We get old when our stem cells are no longer there to repair our bodies. Our bodies also produce less hormones when we are older, and this can affect the skin, hair, body composition and body shape. This results in a decrease in collagen production and elastin, which causes the skin to sag as it loses its ability to retain moisture or retract after stretching. You might probably start noticing such effects in your late 30s or early 40s.
Men seem to age better than women, and doctors attribute it to the gradual decline in testosterone in men compared to the sudden plunge to zero female hormones during menopause. Oil glands are also more active, and stay more active in men, which reduces the dry and sallow look. Women have more facial fat, and so when they age, they tend to develop the sagging look.
One good thing to begin your anti-aging regime is to refrain from smoking, excessive alcohol or caffeine, eating preserved or processed foods, or charred food. Also, it is important to sleep at least eight hours of sleep every night, avoid getting stressed or angry, reduce your calorie intake as you grow older as your metabolism decreases, and finally, to exercise regularly.
People tend to underscore the importance of exercise as part of your anti-aging regime. As one doctor put it: Exercise is the only thing that keeps people looking young. If you have exercised for more than 10 years continuously, you will look as young as the day you started regular exercise.",en,reference

"Researchers in Sweden have revealed the mysterious mechanism responsible for the curved trajectory of curling stones as they slide down the ice in one of the country's more popular winter sports.
In the sport of curling, the players slide large, 20 kg stones along the ice so that they slowly slide towards a target area nearly 30 metres away. The stones often travel on a curved path, sometimes knocking other stones out of the target area as each teams attempt to place their stones as close to the centre target as possible.
Achieving the optimal curved trajectory of the stones is an important part of a team's strategy in the sport. If a player puts a clockwise rotation on the stone, for example, it curls to the right, while a counter-clockwise spin results in the stone curling to the left, allowing them to reach open spots behind previously played stones, or take out opponent stones.
Despite years of speculation by those active in the sport, as well as several scientific articles, no one has been able to offer a good explanation to why the curling stones actually curl – until now.
According to the findings of a team of friction researchers at Uppsala University in eastern Sweden, a curling stone's curved path is due to the microscopic roughness of the stone producing microscopic scratches in the ice.
""As the stone slides over the ice the roughness on its leading half will produce small scratches in the ice,"" the researchers said in a statement.
""The rotation of the stone will give the scratches a slight deviation from the sliding direction.""
Analysis carried out by reseachers Harald Nyberg, Sara Alfredsson, Sture Hogmark and Staffan Jacobson, described the phenomenon as ""scratch-guiding"" or ""track steering"" whereby the rough protrusions on the trailing half of the stone cross over the initial microscopic scratches, crossing them at a small angle.
As the front-end scratches are crossed, they will have a tendency to follow their direction, generating the sideway force necessary to cause the curl.
While curlers have long known of the importance of having the right degree of roughness on the sliding surface of the stone, the roughness had not previously been connected to the steering mechanism, the researchers explained.
The findings have been published in a paper entitled ""The asymmetrical friction mechanism that puts the curl in the curling stone"".",en,academic

"This time of year many of us are out working in the yard using leaf blowers, chain saws, snow blowers and many other hand-held tools. These activities aggravate many of our body parts including our hands and can worsen the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome. There are several conditions that can cause numbness in the hands, however, carpal tunnel is certainly the most common. Although carpal tunnel syndrome is more prevalent in folks over forty it can affect people of all ages, both men and women.
In the early stages of carpal tunnel, we may notice only some tingling or occasional numbness in our hands. This can be brought on by increased activity or repetitive use of our hands. Initially, this may seem to come and go, only happening occasionally. As the condition worsens it becomes more obvious the numbness is involving the thumb, index and middle finger.
The telltale sign of carpal tunnel syndrome is waking up at night or early in the morning with our hand feeling numb and achy. We may have to shake our hand to get the numbness to go away. Stumbling for the alarm clock with a hand that feels like it is not functioning properly oftentimes is a sign of carpal tunnel syndrome. We also may notice the numbness that affects those three fingers while gripping the steering wheel when driving or holding a book while reading.
Some treatment options for carpal tunnel syndrome include stretching exercises where the fingers are pulled back towards the top of the wrist quite firmly, allowing you to feel the stretch in the palm of your hand. Hold this position for approximately 15-20 seconds then repeat. Also, mild anti-inflammatory agents such as Aleve or Advil can be quite helpful, however, care must be taken when using these anti-inflammatories as they do have side effects. Other over the counter remedies include vitamin B6 which is a vitamin that is known to help nerve recovery and oftentimes is helpful in the early stages of carpal tunnel syndrome. Night splints can also be obtained. These can be purchased at a discount store in the first aid section. These splints keep the wrist from bending while we sleep which may keep our hands from falling asleep at night allowing us to have a restful night sleep, which is so important.
If despite these conservative treatments the symptoms seem to worsen and you realize you are dropping things and don’t have the strength in your hand you once had, it may be time to seek medical treatment. There are nerve tests that can be done to help determine if you have carpal tunnel syndrome or if another problem is causing the numbness in your hands. These tests can also help determine the degree of your carpal tunnel. Is it a mild, moderate or severe case? Depending on what the tests reveal, treatment options can be rendered appropriately. If carpal tunnel syndrome is caught in the early stages it can be treated very successfully with surgical intervention and complete resolution can be expected quite readily. Most surgical techniques for carpal tunnel release involve a simple outpatient surgery that takes just minutes and can be done with the patient awake with a local or regional anesthetic. The incisions are usually quite small these days, measuring anywhere from 1/2” to 1” in size. There are several techniques for carpal tunnel surgery and most of them are extremely successful.
In closing, if you are waking up with numb hands and having difficulty with daily activities because of it, try some of the conservative remedies mentioned above. If, indeed, these symptoms do persist or seem to be worsening, give a physician a call. I hope these tips are helpful.

"Tuesday, January 22, 2019 >> 6:01 p.m. CT >> Bramlage Coliseum (12,528) >> Manhattan, Kan.
The first 1,000 fans will receive a Diversity and Inclusion wristband, while special T-shirts are available for $14.99 at K-State Superstore locations and the concourse on gameday.
Kansas State (14-4, 4-2 Big 12) wraps up a brief 2-game homestand on Tuesday, as the Wildcats play host to 14/13 Texas Tech (15-3, 4-2 Big 12) in a test of the Big 12’s top defenses at Bramlage Coliseum. The game will tip at 6:01 p.m., CT on ESPN2 with Jon Sciambi (play-by-play) and Fran Fraschilla (analyst) on the call.
Tuesday’s contest will pit two of the top scoring defenses, as Texas Tech ranks second in the nation in allowing just 55.8 points per game, including 63 points in Big 12 play, while K-State ranks fourth in allowing 59.2 points per game, including a Big 12-best 62.0 points in league action. The Red Raiders allow opponents to shoot a Big 12-best 34.9 percent from the field, including 26.2 percent from 3-point range, while forcing a Big 12-high 16.2 turnovers per game, while the Wildcats allow opponents to connect on 40.6 percent from the field, including 30.6 percent from 3-point range, with 15.3 turnovers per contest.
K-State ran its winning streak to 4 games on Saturday afternoon with another defense gem, holding the Big 12’s top scoring offense (80.4 ppg.) to a season-low in points in earning a 65-55 victory over TCU. The Wildcats jumped out to an 11-3 lead and never trailed in winning wire-to-wire for the second consecutive Big 12 game, as junior Xavier Sneed paced three players in double figures with a season-high 18 points, while Phillips 66 Big 12 Player of the Week Dean Wade added 16 points to go with a game-high 6 assists.
Wade, who is just 3 games back from missing 6 games due to injury, averaged 18 points and 3.5 assists in helping the Wildcats to victories over No. 20/19 Oklahoma and TCU last week. Wade follows teammate Barry Brown, Jr., who was named Big 12 Player of the Week on Jan. 14 after hitting back-to-back game-winners vs. West Virginia (1/9/19) and No. 20/21 Iowa State (1/12/19). They are the first Wildcats to win Big 12 Player of the Week in consecutive weeks since Rodney McGruder did it in back-to-back weeks on Dec. 24, 2012 and Jan. 7, 2013.
Texas Tech enters Tuesday’s game with consecutive losses for the first time this season after dropping games to Iowa State (68-64) and at Baylor (73-62). The Red Raiders, who are led by Big 12 Player of the Year candidate Jarrett Culver, who leads the squad in scoring (18.8 ppg.), rebounding (7.1 rpg.) and assists (3.9 apg.).
This will be the 40th meeting between K-State and Texas Tech with the Wildcats holding a 23-16 advantage, including a 15-3 mark in games played at home. The Red Raiders have won 6 of the last 8 meetings (3 in a row), including a 63-57 victory on Jan. 5 at home, in which, the Wildcats could not overcome a 16-point deficit.
No. 14/13 Texas Tech (13-3, 2-2 Big 12) has dropped back-to-back games in Big 12 play to Iowa State (68-64) and at Baylor (73-62) after winning 15 of its first 16 games, including the first 4 in league action. The Red Raiders connected on 46.7 percent from the field in the loss to the Bears, but allowed 11 Baylor 3-pointers and 11 second-chance points on 12 offensive rebounds.
Texas Tech is averaging 71.6 points on 47.4 percent shooting, including 34.1 percent from 3-point range, to go with 35.2 rebounds, 13.8 assists, 7.4 steals and 5.2 blocks per game, while allowing a Big 12-best 55.8 points on 34.9 percent shooting, including 26.2 percent from 3-point range. The team is connecting on 70.5 percent from the free throw line.
A Big 12 Player of the Year candidate, sophomore Jarrett Culver, , paces the Red Raiders in scoring (18.8 ppg.), rebounding (7.1 rpg.) and assists (3.9 apg.) while connecting on 54.2 percent shooting from the field, including 36.8 percent from 3-point range. Two other players are averaging in double figures in graduate transfer Matt Mooney (10.7 ppg.) and sophomore Davide Moretti (10.0 ppg.), while graduate transfer Tariq Owens has a team-high 2.6 blocks to go with 8.1 points and 5.1 rebounds per game.
Texas Tech is led by head coach Chris Beard, who has posted a 60-27 (.690) record in his third season. He has a 231-77 (.750) overall record in his 10th season as a head coach, which includes stints at McMurry (2012-13), Angelo State (2013-15) and Little Rock (2015-16).
K-State and Texas Tech will meet for the 40th time in their histories with the Wildcats holding a 23-16 advantage in the series, including a 15-3 mark at home. The Wildcats own a slight 16-15 edge since the start of Big 12 play.
Texas Tech has won 6 of the last 8 meetings, including 3 in a row dating back to 2018. Last season, the Red Raiders swept the season series for the first time since the start of round-robin play in 2013 with a 74-58 victory at home on Jan. 6 before a 66-47 win in Manhattan on Feb. 10. It was the first win at Bramlage Coliseum since 2007, snapping a 8-game losing streak.
In the last meeting between the schools on Jan. 5 in Lubbock, Texas Tech led wire-to-wire for a 63-57 victory, as K-State could not recover from a 16-point deficit. Senior Barry Brown, Jr., led three Wildcats in double figures with 16 points, while junior Makol Mawien had a double-double with 10 points and a career-best 11 rebounds.
Head coach Bruce Weber is 8-6 all-time against Texas Tech, including a 5-1 mark at home, while Weber is 1-4 against head coach Chris Beard.
Senior Dean Wade has had the most success against Texas Tech in his career, averaging 12.2 points on 49 percent shooting in 6 career games (6 starts), while fellow senior Barry Brown, Jr., has averaged 11.4 points and 2.3 steals in 7 career games (6 starts) vs. the Red Raiders.
K-State has posted a 374-117 (.762) record at Bramlage Coliseum since its opening during the 1988-89 season. The 374 wins are the second-most at a home venue, trailing the 378 wins at Ahearn Field House (1950-88).
K-State has registered a 173-37 (.823) record at home over the past 13 seasons, including a 74-32 (.695) mark in Big 12 play. The 173 wins rank fourth among all Big 12 schools in that span, while the 74 league victories at home rank third. In all, the program has earned double-digit victories in 25 of its 30 seasons in the arena, including a streak of 17 straight seasons.
Head coach Bruce Weber has tallied an 89-21 (.809) record at Bramlage Coliseum since taking over at K-State. The 21 losses (18 of which have come in Big 12 play) have come by a total of 160 points or 7.6 points per game.",en,reference

"When converting, it is likely that you will need to change the use of some rooms. A spare room could be converted into another bathroom or a reception room can be made into an additional bedroom. You might also need to move walls in order to alter the room sizes, which is something that needs to be carefully planned before you do anything. It is advisable to talk with a professional when working on some of the more complicated parts of the conversion.
There are some landlords who will convert a garage into additional space. This will require planning permission so you need to contact your local authority. Converting your reception rooms may be essential, but is not always the right decision. In the best situation, the property will have 2 reception rooms and one can be converted while the other is left as a living area. Tenants will often be put off by a property that does not have any reception space so you need to consider this carefully.
One of the primary differences between a standard rental and an HMO is the fact that you will generally have a higher turnover of renters. This is why you should look at setting aside at least two months’ worth of rent every year to cover any potential void periods.",en,reference
"Just feel. This music was recorded in an afternoon with no planned approach, no talk of what it should sound like and no song structures. Three sound-brothers making music in the most organic, joyful way possible. A cosmic catharsis. Music scored on the fly — electric guitar below, banjos and mandolin above, filtered through strings of effects pedals while being propelled by the percussive pulse of wood, steel and skins. All deployed in a fashion that pushes and pulls as if at one with the tide and buoyed by the blues.
With no preconception, what was captured was a sort of long overdue conversation, in a language not studied, but fluently spoken and uniquely their own — a soft tread into Appalachia that side-winds into Krautrock and drifts down terrestrial pathways through time and space. An ecstatic sound for all the East Coast heads and a salve offering to melt and evaporate the currents of turbulence. Ease on back and enjoy the ride.

Q. How do I start a TIFA Chapter in my area?
A. TIFA’s Bylaws impose very few requirements for obtaining official recognition of a local Chapter. The Chapter must be organized by three TIFA members in good standing; it must meet in a public place; and it must meet at least once a month. Two of three requirements should be simple enough; the only one that may seem difficult is finding an appropriate place to meet. Go to the ‘Chapters’ tab and on the drop down menu under the header ‘Starting a New Chapter’ you will find more information. When you are ready, give us a call at 512-371-0900 and we can help.
Q. Is there a list of books we are not allowed to send to offenders who are in TDCJ?
Q. If a grievance has not been responded to within 30 days who else, other than the Ombudsman and regional director, can help you?
A. You can file a grievance about the grievance… And you can also file the Step 2 with a copy of the original grievance, explaining that it has not been resolved. Just make sure it is something the System can resolve and that you had first tried to talk to the official in charge before filing the Step 1. You are covered that way. And always keep copies.
Q. Who notifies next of kin when an inmate is moved to a free world hospital in an emergency situation?
A. Currently the Warden needs to be aware of the medical emergency and then he uses his discretion whether to notify the family or not. Communication between TDCJ and free world health care is none existent and is currently under review for change.
Q. Does the annual health care service fee of $100 apply to patients who have a chronic condition?
A. No. But the minute a patient mentions any other issue they are having other than the chronic condition or they freely go to medical with any other medical issue the fee is charged.",en,reference

"Week In Review - April 8 2019 | Investor Resources Inc.
The U.S. Economy Created 196,000 Jobs in March… Friday’s report beat expectations of 175,000 and the unemployment rate steadied at 3.8%.
What it means – This a nice comeback following February’s dreadful 20,000 hires (now revised upward to 33,000). Last month’s bad showing combined with all the wonkiness in interest rates led many to worry about an imminent recession. Today’s numbers will put some of that aside. But we’re trending in the wrong direction.
For the quarter, the economy has added an average of 180,000 jobs. That’s a respectable number, but down from last year, which kicked off the first three months of the year with a monthly average of 223,000.
On the wage side, earnings fell below expectations, growing just 0.1% as the annual increase slid to 3.2%.
The markets reacted positively to this news Friday and pushed fears of an economic slowdown.
The U.S. and China Made Significant Progress in Trade Talks… Administrative officials from Economic Advisor Larry Kudlow on down commented on positive progress in the trade talks, giving the impression that an end to the trade war is near.
What it means – Investors keep pushing the U.S. and Chinese markets higher based on optimism for a deal. The S&P 500 is up more than 13% this year, while the Shanghai is up almost 30%. But then what? The Chinese economy is still losing steam, and the U.S. economy looks like it will expand by less than 2% in the first quarter and earnings growth will turn negative.
With Brexit looming and weak growth across Europe to boot, a trade deal with China could be a great time to protect gains rather than add to positions.
What it means – Averaging the two results is 0.25% growth each month. Not great, but not negative. Still, for February, the closer you look, the worse it gets. Excluding autos, retail sales fell 0.4%, and if you strip out autos and gas, sales dipped 0.6%. Those aren’t results that will make retailers sleep well at night. It goes a long way in explaining why earnings look thin for the first quarter.
As noted, auto sales were a bright spot in the report, and will be a bright spot in the March numbers as well. Auto unit sales increased from 16.5 million in February, which is included in this report, to 17.5 million in March, which will help if consumers remain on the sidelines in other areas.
Durable Goods Orders Fall 1.6%… Aircraft orders dragged down the report. Excluding aircraft, orders were up 0.1%.
What it means – Drilling down further to core capital goods (a proxy for business spending), orders fell 0.1%, which was below the estimate of up 0.2%. Shipments of core capital goods were off pointing to weakness in business spending at quarter end. This is a turn from growth at the end of 2018 and in January, to the modest growth in February, and now contraction. It could be a rough second quarter if orders don’t turn around.
Brexit Still Up in the Air… British Prime Minister Theresa May submitted her proposal for leaving the EU for the third time and lost again. Members of Parliament offered several other proposals. None gathered enough votes to move forward.
What it means – The EU informed May that if her deal wasn’t approved, then Britain would have to leave the EU by Friday, April 12. Now May is conferring with Jeremy Corbyn who leads the opposition Labor Party, trying to find anything that resembles middle ground. It’s likely that there will be another extension. The situation changes by the day.
The only constant is that Parliament has voted not to leave with a hard Brexit, with no trade or border deals in place. And yet, without any proposal gaining steam, a hard Brexit is exactly where they are headed.
Cryptocurrencies: Are They Stocks, or What?… Bitcoin is supposed to operate like money, even though almost no one tries to buy stuff with it. Instead, it acts like a digital investment. Still, the U.S. regulatory world considers bitcoin and some of its brethren assets like gold.
But other digital coins as they are called operate like stock. Holders buy them, and the profitability of the companies that issued them determines the coin’s value. If that sounds like a stock to you, then you’re not alone. The SEC agrees, and it frowns on companies issuing stock in the form of coins without going through the registration process and following the rules. If you own any of these, be careful.
As for bitcoin and the others, if you exchanged them for anything last year, like a sandwich or a car, check with your accountant. You might have to list every transaction for tax purposes as a capital gain or loss.
Thieves Steal Knives from Amnesty Box in Britain… The U.K. has a problem with knife violence. Because guns are so difficult to get, criminals turn to the next thing. In one area, knife crime increased 52% over last year, so authorities installed a knife drop-off amnesty box. Anyone could put a knife in the box, no questions asked. Apparently, other criminals thought that was a good place to get knives, so they cracked open the box and took the contents.
Lucky for authorities, they found the knives a short distance away and have the entire incident on CCTV. Apparently, no one thought putting up a sign saying, “Drop your knives here,” doubled as an advertisement for those who wanted knives. Along with their counterparts in Australia, members of Parliament have failed to notice that guns weren’t the problem. It’s criminals that cause crime.",en,web
"In March, we celebrated the grand opening of the Indiana IoT Lab. About 1,000 guests helped us kick off a new era for innovation in Indiana, signaling an important shift for Indiana’s economy. Even though the paint on the walls is barely dry and the member and sponsor logos are freshly hung, our focus has now shifted to the operational excellence required to cultivate a world-class innovation environment with the internet of things at its core.
As Fishers Mayor Scott Fadness put it, IoT is an opportunity Indiana can’t afford to waste. Our state’s key industries—manufacturing, agriculture and logistics—face imminent disruption from internet-connected devices, referred to collectively as the internet of things.
Thus, we find ourselves with two choices: Ignore these changes at our peril or embrace change to maintain a leadership position in these important industries—and maybe even invent some new ones along the way. Rather than leaving the fate of Indiana’s core industries to far-removed developers on the coasts, we decided to lay a foundation for grass-roots IoT innovation within state lines. The Indiana IoT Lab in Fishers is the result.
Make no mistake, the lab is a big win for the city of Fishers. But why is the Indiana IoT Lab important to the rest of the state? To answer this question, we must first examine who Indiana IoT is, apart from a building on Technology Drive.
We are made up of stakeholders from throughout the state.
It’s in the name and also the goal: The Indiana IoT Lab Network is a statewide project, involving leaders from all over the state with the goal of building IoT capabilities into our traditional strengths in industry. To accomplish any kind of meaningful change, a diverse collection of brains with different backgrounds is a requirement.
I’m grateful for leaders at organizations from across Indiana who are championing the cause. Indiana University is a founding partner of the lab and represents the next generation of Indiana’s business leaders and engineers, those steeped in intelligent systems engineering, cyber-physical systems, and human-computer interaction. Comcast, a founding sponsor, is exploring options to support smart-city infrastructure in Indiana and partnering with us to launch a next-generation LoRaWAN network (which wirelessly connects battery-operated devices to the internet) to power IoT innovation.
Allegion, a security-products company based in Carmel and also a founding sponsor, recently announced the creation of a $50 million venture capital fund for early-stage companies focused on innovation in the security field. Mayor Scott Fadness and the city of Fishers made the Indiana IoT Lab the first city-funded IoT lab in the nation. The lab is no one person, but rather a collection of forward-thinking organizations from across the state.
We are a template for statewide collaboration on IoT innovation.
Even though the Indiana IoT Lab is open and thriving, the quest is far from over. Our goal is a statewide network of IoT centers of excellence, similar to the Indiana Coworking Passport.
From Launch Fishers’ humble beginnings in the basement of the Fishers Library, we grew to 50 cooperating locations offering reciprocal rights to our collective 3,000 members, enabling members of one location to work at another location throughout the state. This removes barriers to our entrepreneurs doing business within the state and improves collaboration as we connect more of our entrepreneurs statewide. We see the same potential in IoT, with fewer locations but similar impact.
Each Indiana community has something different to offer, for both coworking and IoT. In Fishers and metro Indy, we have access to a number of experts in the software and security fields. Elkhart counts nearly half of its jobs as manufacturing, earning the region a recent WSJ story with the headline: “The Future of America’s Economy Looks a Lot Like Elkhart, Indiana.” Lafayette’s access to the Purdue Agricultural Program provides it a distinct skill set, and southwestern Indiana’s plastics capabilities are well-known to the world.
Let’s capitalize on the rich history of industry expertise and leadership throughout our state by introducing world-class IoT skills, something Steve Case has written about in his book “The Third Wave.” It’s only through a network of leaders in these communities across our state that we can change entire industries and ultimately change the world!
We are an example of what Indiana can be when smart people with good attitudes come together with a common vision.
Top colleges and universities throughout Indiana have produced notable graduates, including Todd Wagner, Mark Cuban, Scott Dorsey and Neil Armstrong. Include tech pioneer Scott Jones and Apple’s head of retail, Angela Ahrendts, and it’s clear Hoosiers not only have the know-how to exceed in their fields, but also the courage to roll up their sleeves and get the work done.
Can you imagine what a team made up of the best Hoosier minds could do together? This is the type of opportunity we have in front of us, and our fortunes for generations will be dictated by how well we collaborate today.

Your tenant needs your permission before taking out a Green Deal. If your tenant wishes to take out a Green Deal Plan, they will first need your agreement to both the improvements and the financial aspects of the plan, like the amount of the repayments and how long the repayments need to be paid for.
Where the tenant is the electricity bill payer, they will need to make repayments for the Green Deal on their electricity bill. So you will need their express permission before taking out a Green Deal at the property.

"This paper examines how open source software is being incorporated into the business models of companies in the software industry. The goal is to answer the question of whether the open source model can help sustain economic growth. While some companies are able to maintain a ""pure"" open source approach with their business model, the reality is that most companies are relying on proprietary add-on value in order to generate revenue because open source itself is simply not big business. Ultimately however, the use of open source software is expanding, therefore suggesting that it provides benefits that can help sustain economic growth.

"Dr. Alan Lincoln is a past graduate of this program, having graduated with his Ph.D. in 1980. Dr. Lincoln was educated during the early phase of the professional school movement, a time when clinical psychologists were in such short supply and when training models fell short of adequately preparing psychologists for the rigorous demands of clinical work.
Dr. Lincoln's doctoral dissertation examined infant-adult micro interactions. Dr. Lincoln evaluated normal 2-month-old infants during videotaped interactions with parents and strangers. Between 1980 and 1983 Dr. Lincoln completed a postdoctoral fellowship in Neuroscience at UCSD and started NIH programmatic research focused on electrophysiology in persons with neurodevelopmental disorders.
Dr. Lincoln has continued to work on NIH funded research for the past 34 years involving studies of physiology, pathophysiology, structural and functional brain development, pharmacology, neuropsychology, and behavior intervention for persons with neurodevelopmental disorders and neuropsychiatric disorders. Following Dr. Lincoln's postdoctoral fellowship he also completed advanced coursework through the San Diego Psychoanalytic Institute in a two year training program involving psychoanalytic psychotherapy for children and adolescents.
Dr. Lincoln continued to conduct research, teach classes, supervise students and engaged in a small private practice until about 1998. Dr. Lincoln was appointed as a core faculty member a few years earlier. The autism epidemic caused him to refocus from having his primarily study of the biological and neuropsychological underpinnings of persons with autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders to developing programs to help treat such individuals. This ultimately led to the development of a large intervention program covering four counties, employing about 150 individuals and treating about 400 individuals yearly.
Dr. Lincoln served as the President and CEO for 15 years until he sold the agency in 2013. In 2004 Dr. Lincoln completed his postdoctoral MS in clinical psychopharmacology. Dr. Lincoln became a board certified Behavior Analyst about 5 years ago. In addition to his responsibilities as Interim Program Director for our program, he is also the Interim Program Director for our Postdoctoral MS in Clinical Psychopharmacology Program. For the past two years Dr. Lincoln chaired our faculty senate. Dr. Lincoln earned the rank of Distinguished Professor this past year.

"Rick is the president of Market Street Railway and a longtime railfan. I recently spoke with Rick about his new book, On Track: A Field Guide to San Francisco’s Historic Streetcars & Cable Cars, a guidebook that can teach anyone and everyone—train enthusiasts and SF locals included—a thing or two about these beautiful and practical forms of public transit.
MC: You fell in love with streetcars as a child, when your mother took you downtown on an “iron monster” through the Twin Peaks Tunnel. How did you go from this childhood obsession to being president of the Market Street Railway?
RL: I’ve always been interested in public transit in general, because it’s essential in making San Francisco the livable city it is. When I started my career, as a broadcast journalist, I covered Muni and learned a lot about its operations, both positive and things that could be improved. After leaving journalism for a corporate job, though, I was free to be an advocate; and when I saw the opportunity to revive streetcars on the surface of Market Street, I jumped at it, with the strong support of my employer at the time, Bechtel. Once we had the Trolley Festival demonstration service running, it was clear that a nonprofit support group would be helpful to making that service permanent. That’s how I got involved with Market Street Railway.
What is Market Street Railway, anyhow? Is it part of Muni?
Market Street Railway is an independent, volunteer-based organization that serves as Muni’s nonprofit preservation partner. Our volunteers help publicize the historic streetcar service, provide maps and historic information on board the streetcars, and even help keep the cars clean while in service. We also operate the popular San Francisco Railway Museum across from the Ferry Building, telling the story of how efficient public transit built the city we love today.
What are some popular misconceptions about historic streetcars?
Some people seem to think they’re way more expensive to operate than other types of transit, but that’s simply not true. Maybe they think something that looks so good and is so much fun to ride should cost more to operate.
Some people also confuse Market Street Railway’s role with that of Muni. The transit agency owns and operates the historic streetcars, just as they do the cable cars. The streetcars are an integral part of the city’s transit system, used by thousands of commuters from the Castro and Upper Market neighborhoods and many Fisherman’s Wharf workers. They’re essential to mobility and commerce on their route, and in fact replaced regular Muni bus routes (more than doubling their ridership, by the way). What Market Street Railway does is help Muni with things like acquiring additional historic streetcars, plus signage, marketing, and even keeping the streetcars clean while in service. And we tell the story of the central role transit played in building the San Francisco we love today, and how important it still is to keep our city livable.
One thing I really like about On Track is that, in addition to being a comprehensive field guide, it also provides a history of public transit in San Francisco that is integral to the history of the city itself. How have San Francisco’s cable car and streetcar lines shaped the city?
People today take public transit for granted. But when San Francisco was a young city, public transit was integral to shaping the development of neighborhoods. For example, you’ll notice that on the hill between the Castro District and Noe Valley, the homes are older and a little grander on Castro Street than on parallel streets. That’s because a cable car line was built all the way from the Ferry Building up Market Street and over Castro in the 1880s, speeding the development of the blocks along the way. Later on, capital investments like the Twin Peaks Tunnel and the Sunset Tunnel opened up the entire southwest quadrant of the city to residential development. Fast connections to downtown made the Sunset and Parkside districts grow. Even today, the new light rail line on Third has helped accelerate development in Mission Bay and Dogpatch.
I think it’s really cool that you wrote this book for not only tourists and railfans, but also the people who live in the city. What’s something about streetcars and cable cars that might surprise even lifelong San Franciscans?
The first American transit operation owned by a big city government didn’t start up until 1912—and yes, it happened here, with Muni. Many at the time considered government ownership of public utilities to be “socialist.” Here, it was part of the Progressive Movement.
Today, with all U.S. transit agencies receiving large tax subsidies, it’s hard to imagine that it was once possible for private transit companies to pay what was then a middle-class wage to their workers, charge a nickel a ride, and still make a profit. But that’s the way it was.
What do you want to see happen next with San Francisco’s streetcars and cable cars?
I want to find the time to actually ride them more often!
Seriously, Market Street Railway has a strategic vision for the historic streetcars that includes a second line, the E-Embarcadero stretching first from Fisherman’s Wharf to the Giants ballpark and Caltrain along the waterfront, using existing tracks (service on this part will start next year), then extended on both ends, to Fort Mason to the west, using an existing historic railroad tunnel and along the existing Third Street light rail line to the south, providing better service to the fast growing Mission Bay and Dogpatch neighborhoods, the growing UCSF Mission Bay Campus and the new Warriors Arena.
We have helped Muni acquire additional streetcars to restore as demand grows, and we’d like to see some of the most historic unrestored streetcars fixed up soon.
We’d also like to see some changes made that would let both the streetcars and cable cars run more frequently and efficiently, especially the streetcars on Market Street. We’re active in efforts to achieve these things.
Admit it: even though all the streetcars and cable cars are beautiful, surely there’s a first among equals for you. Which is your favorite, and why?
From a history standpoint, my favorite is Muni’s Number 1. It’s amazing to me that a transit agency still has the very first vehicle it owned, more than a century later. This is the very streetcar that Mayor “Sunny Jim” Rolph personally piloted out Geary Street in 1912 to open America’s very first municipally owned big city transit line. I’m proud that our advocacy led to its complete restoration a few years ago, just in time for Muni’s centennial.
From a fun standpoint, my favorites are the two open-topped “boat trams,” built for Blackpool, England’s seaside resort in 1934. My then-employer, Bechtel, helped Muni acquire its first one in the 1980s, and a generous grant from the Thoresen Foundation allowed us to acquire its twin from Blackpool last year and donate it to Muni. All you have to do is watch people’s faces as they cruise along Market Street or The Embarcadero in one of these boats—or watch the smiles on passersby as they see the boats glide by and hear the jaunty toots from their whistles—and you’ll see why I love those cars. They provide the ultimate joy ride!",en,books

I see that pin 7 on the cga port is marked as 5+ but on pinouts of the port says (reserved) or (ttl video).

The standard is for pin 7 on the CGA to be not connected, however some cards are dual CGA and MGA. On those cards pin 7 is the mono video signal.
The is enough resistance in the schematic to not harm the video output of a mono card and a CGA that has no connection on pin 7 wont be harmed either.
The lack of 5v being output by the video card means the circuit wont work. You will need to get a non switchable CGA video card that has no connection on pin 7 and connect it to a 5V source on the card.
That adapter will produce an incorrect color for #6 (brown); it will show up as light yellow. Otherwise it seems ok.
Why is #6 brown? Answer (http://www.oldskool.org/pc/cgacal).
Thanks, for the reply's guys also joining together the sync signals using resistors is not an AC short ?
It has resistors, they are protected and attenuated.
The transistor is just converting the signals to negative composed sync, but it won't be a serrated vsync. But the scart 2 hdmi doesn't care about it.
It might work but just using a XNOR gate between H and V and adding a 470 ohm resistor at the output.
The brown color could be fixed by adding decoders. If we had a fast EPROM (10ns) that would be simple, but they are damn slow. Maybe a GAL ?
See here (http://www.vcfed.org/forum/showthread.php?17610-CGA-to-SCART-adaptor&p=452967#post452967). I have named the three different schematics variants ""1 to 3"" (this one is variant 1), there is even a fourth variant. There you can read my explanation for your pin 7 question.
Note that the Green signal should be connected to SCART pin 11 instead of 4, this was an error in this diagram.
I can say that I have built variant 3 and it works perfectly (without brown-fix however, but I don't really need that), see my pictures over there.
Why don't you need the brown fix?
Because most of the games I play use either one of the two standard CGA palettes, or cyan, red & white (which was also quite popular among game developers and good-looking IMHO). None of these are affected by the brown problem.
But there is actually one CGA game where I would like to have the correct brown color displayed: Defender of the Crown (CGA). It still looks good without the brown fix, but of course it's not the real thing.
Ok, Paku Paku (http://deathshadow.com/pakuPaku) also uses the brown color, but I don't mind seeing dark yellow instead of brown, the game is still great anyway!
Thanks for the link, i don't whant care for the brown color going to build one you provided in the shematic.
the only problem i see is that i have an original brown cga card from ibm, i don't think theres a signal on pin 7 to feed power to the transistor.
Maybe i have to add a separated power supply for it a cellphone one that provide 5v?
... i don't think theres a signal on pin 7 to feed power to the transistor.
You should be able get 5v from the ISA Bus pin B3. See Here (http://pinouts.ru/Slots/ISA_pinout.shtml) Preferably, trace to a point on the card that can easily be soldered to and run a wire from there to the pin 7 on the connector as long as it is NC. If necessary, you can solder to the finger of the edge connector, but be careful not to let the solder get to far down on the finger so that it doesn't get into the ISA connector when the card is plugged in. You may need to cut a trace if pin 7 is connected. I don't have the schematic in front of me for the IBM CGA card but it should be easy enough to check visually or with a meter.
I believe this is what David_M indicated when he said ""You will need to get a non switchable CGA video card that has no connection on pin 7 and connect it to a 5V source on the card."" in post #2.
Wouldn't be easier to use any wall wart psu ? Get an old cellphone charger (the ones before the USB) that does 5V and voila or buy these universal psu at any electronics shop.
Might be ""easier"", but not as tidy. He would have another cord to manage and use another outlet on his power strip. Plus, he would need to purchase the ""wall wart"". So, in My mind, not easier after all.
I would recommend to forget about the ""pin 7"" solution and use an external power supply. That of course means one more cable hanging from your adapter, but it has the advantage that your historic hardware will be kept unmodified. I simply connected a Micro-USB plug cable (so that I can plug in any cellphone charger), check your local electronic store for such a ready-made cable. I used item number 1414354 - 62 from Conrad which is currently sold out, but here (http://www.conrad.com/ce/en/product/1535015/?insert=62&insertNoDeeplink&productname=Connector-straight----------BKL-Electronic----Content-1-pcs) is another such cable.
Thanks for the ideas, guys i thing im going to use the external psu option so i can change the adapter to other systems easy.
Thanks for the info but in my case i have some monitors that i hacked rgb into them don't need power to switch to RGB.
A lot of SCART devices didn't quite follow the spec properly, so most TVs have a way to force RGB mode.
Got the adapter up an running at least the color part :D, now playing magy duck on a sony kx27ps1 that i got for 10 bucks only have to replace 3 caps and is running like new!.
Using 5+ for the rgb blanking signal to scart the speks says 3v not sure if this 2v over voltage could be bad for the monitor.
Now using the composite output from the CGA card as sync but when i get more SN74xx chips going to do it again :P.
Where you can find that game or did you mispell the name?
And yes i mispell it.
found another schematic for a vga - scart adapter.
This one don't need external power to mix the H-V to Composite Sync.

"The global enterprise governance, risk and compliance market size was estimated at USD 24.76 billion in 2017. Increasing adoption of these solutions by various firms is anticipated to be the key growth factor over the forecast period. Moreover, an increasingly complex business environment has paved the way for implementation of enterprise governance, risk and compliance (GRC) solutions among industries.
GRC is an innovative and multifaceted approach that encompasses people, technologies, and processes to help improve performance, gain visibility, and reduce compliance costs. The major factor responsible for the advent of GRC within companies is growing demand for corporate governance and conformity. Moreover, proper governance ensures economic growth and success of an organization.
EGRC comprises software wherein data, policies, and controls are strategically achieved and visible throughout the enterprise. Such as strategy, buoyed by a common technology platform, creates transparency and consistency, fosters operational efficiency, enables collaboration, and ensures success and continuity of the organization.
Instead of treating each conformity and risk issue as an individual problem, firms are now seeking for a common approach. Companies that do not implement such integrated solutions are paying substantially in terms of increased complexity, wasted resources, decreased flexibility, and greater exposure to threats, which eventually impedes business growth and performance.
In the last few years, notable corporate crises, such as Lululemon Athletica and Sony, have created the need to understand, assess, and manage likely challenges across firms. Threats in all aspects of business as well as ad hoc management of those crises leave them susceptible to impact on their revenues and reputations.
The global economic crisis of 2008 led to sweeping of new regulations for the banking, financial services, and insurance (BFSI) sector, necessitating a look at external and internal processes and consequences. Moreover, consumer privacy regulations and laws in Europe and other regions have created unique challenges for different multi-national entities that carry their businesses on the web.
The software segment accounted for a revenue share of over 62.0% in 2017 and is anticipated to continue its dominance over the forecast period. Decreasing total cost of ownership of software with integrated solutions to tackle myriad regulations, such as compliance to supply chain, quality control, and OSHA, is anticipated to be a key factor driving market growth. Moreover, increasing need for assessment of third-party and supplier risk and audits are likely to propel the market at a significant rate.
Risk management emerged as the largest software category and accounted for over 25.0% of the overall revenue in 2017. It helps in averting breaches against these requirements and subsequent penalties. Organizations need an active form of risk management so as to fulfill various conformities.
Audit management emerged as the second-largest software segment, amounting to USD 3.48 billion in 2017. Audit management solutions facilitate organizations’ compliance and auditing responsibilities by providing a centralized platform for accessing information about earlier assessments and manage due or ongoing ones. It also helps in supporting company-wide conformity initiatives to reinforce better working practices and greater accountability within individual business units.
The global demand for GRC has seen a paradigm shift owing to emergence of Internet of Things (IoT) and other digital frameworks within the GRC process.
Consulting services emerged as the largest segment and accounted for over 33.0% of the total market revenue in 2017. Enterprise governance and compliance management is quickly evolving in response to advancements and changes in technology, hiring, personnel requirements, business practices, and consumer demands and concerns. Big data will become a larger part of GRC and will assist in adhering to regulations, legislations, and form processes, and support professionals to make threat-informed choices on digital business.
Major companies including SAP SE; Thomson Reuters; Bwise; MetricStream Inc.; and Wolters Kluwer facilitate expertise solutions with their consultancy portfolio, which helps businesses assess trends and current practices as well as achieve value-added results through their operations. Various companies also facilitate market intelligence solutions in incident management, ethics management, policy management, and industry benchmarking to provide a holistic view of expenses for future spend-management.
BFSI emerged as the largest segment in the enterprise governance, risk and compliance market and was valued at USD 5.14 billion in 2017. Banks and financial institutions are swamped by regulations introduced as a repercussion of the 2008 financial crisis. The devastating impact of the crisis on the global economy resulted in regulators imposing stricter norms and ensuring accountability, transparency, and risk management. Main regulators driving IT spending for governing compliance are BASEL III, Dodd Frank Act, EMIR, SEPA, and MIFID II.
Telecom and IT emerged as the fastest growing sector for GRC, projected to exhibit a CAGR of 13.8% from 2018 to 2025. The sector faces an increasingly challenging and complex business environment with rising pressure to persist whilst ensuring long-term sustainability. Thus, it is dealing with several conformity requirements across multiple geographies, including ongoing license rights. Organizations in this sector are also implementing effective ways of managing and prioritizing impending challenges along with complying with cross-border and local legislation, mandates, and standards.
The large enterprises segment dominated the market and was valued at USD 17.2 billion in 2017. In view of changing regulatory scenarios, management in large organizations is increasingly focused on building transparency to mitigate threats associated with the bottom line of the balance sheet. This, as a result, has led to the emergence of GRC solutions and services in large organizations.
The small and medium enterprise (SME) segment is anticipated to exhibit a CAGR of 13.2% over the forecast period. Regardless of the size of the balance sheet in the current scenario, it is mandatory for several companies operating in the BFSI, manufacturing, telecom, and retail sectors, among others, to adhere to strict regulations and manage risks associated with the industry. Thus, increasing government regulation across several verticals to protect consumers is anticipated to boost spending on GRC solutions and services in SMEs.
North America is projected to continue to dominate the market, accounting for over 32.0% of the overall revenue in 2025. Increase in cyber-attacks within the region over the last few years has significantly increased the need for enterprise governance, risk and compliance management solutions. Moreover, emergence of technologies such as big data, Internet of Things (IoT), and cloud software is anticipated to propel the growth of GRC software over the forecast period.
Asia Pacific is projected to exhibit a strong CAGR of 14.3% over the forecast period owing to high growth as well as adoption of Internet and mobile technology in the last few years. Emerging economies such as India, China, and Japan have been experiencing strong economic growth. Moreover, an expanding technology user base and rapidly developing infrastructure are responsible for driving the market.
The global market is highly competitive and fairly concentrated, with the top five companies accounting for the maximum share in 2016. Key market participants include SAP SE; Bwise; MetricStream Inc.; Thomson Reuters; and Wolters Kluwer. Players have been using strategies such as collaboration, acquisition, and new product development and launch to strengthen their position in the market.
Application development and customized software are expected to be key parameters to staying competitive in this market, with frequent mergers and acquisitions being undertaken as an attempt to diversify product portfolio and gain market share. Thomson Reuters, a GRC solution provider acquired 16 companies worth USD 316 million between 2014 to 2016 to make remarkable expansions in its business.",en,reference
"Warning: This article is out of date and no longer works. Please read the updated Discourse article instead.
Discourse is an open source discussion platform built for the next decade of the Internet. We'll walk through all of the steps required to get Discourse running on your DigitalOcean Droplet.
Ubuntu 14.04 Droplet (64 bit) with a minimum of 2 GB of RAM. If you need help with this part, this tutorial will get you started.
Discourse recommends 1 GB of RAM for small communities and 2 GB of RAM for larger communities. It also requires a swap file if you are using 1 GB of RAM. Although swap is generally recommended for systems utilizing traditional spinning hard drives, using swap with SSDs can cause issues with hardware degradation over time. Due to this consideration, we do not recommend enabling swap on DigitalOcean or any other provider that utilizes SSD storage. Doing so can impact the reliability of the underlying hardware for you and your neighbors. Hence, we recommend a minimum of 2 GB of RAM to run Discourse on a DigitalOcean Droplet. Refer to How To Add Swap on Ubuntu 14.04 for details on using swap.
You can use an IP address as your domain for testing, but for a production server, you should have a domain that resolves to your Droplet. This tutorial can help.
Free account on Mandrill and get SMTP credentials. It wouldn't hurt to test the validity of these credentials beforehand, although you can use them for the first time with Discourse.
All the commands in this tutorial should be run as a non-root user. If root access is required for the command, it will be preceded by sudo. Initial Server Setup with Ubuntu 14.04 explains how to add users and give them sudo access.
In this section we will install Git to download the Discourse source files. Git is an open source distributed version control and source code management system.
In this section we will install Docker so that Discourse will have an isolated environment in which to run. Docker is an open source project that can pack, ship, and run any application in a lightweight container. For more introductory information about Docker, please see this tutorial.
In this section we will download Discourse.
In this section we will configure your initial Discourse settings.
The configuration file will open in the nano text editor.
## TODO: How many concurrent web requests are supported?
Choose the email address that you want to use for the Discourse admin account. It can be totally unrelated to your Discourse domain and can be any email address you find convenient. Set this email address in the DISCOURSE_DEVELOPER_EMAILS line. This email address will be made the Discourse admin by default, once a user registers with that email. You'll need this email address later when you set up Discourse from its web control panel.
Replace me@example.com with your email.
Developer Email setup is required for creating and activating your initial administrator account.
Set DISCOURSE_HOSTNAME to discourse.example.com. This means you want your Discourse forum to be available at http://discourse.example.com/. You can use an IP address here instead if you don't have a domain pointing to your server yet. Only one domain (or IP) can be listed here.
Replace discourse.example.com with your domain. A hostname is required to access your Discourse instance from the web.
We recommend Mandrill for your SMTP mail server. Get your SMTP credentials from Mandrill.
The SMTP settings are required to send mail from your Discourse instance; for example, to send registration emails, password reset emails, reply notifications, etc.
Having trouble setting up mail credentials? See the Discourse Email Troubleshooting guide.
Setting up mail credentials is required, or else you will not be able to bootstrap your Discourse instance. The credentials must be correct, or else you will not be able to register users (including the admin user) for the forum.
Also in the env section of the configuration file, set db_shared_buffers to 128MB and UNICORN_WORKERS to 2 so you have more memory room.
Tuning these memory settings will optimize Discourse performance on a 1 GB Droplet.
NOTE: The above changes are mandatory and should not be skipped, or else you will have a broken Discourse forum.
Save the app.yml file, and exit the text editor.
In this section we will bootstrap Discourse.
Note: If you don't change Docker's DNS settings before running the bootstrap command, you may get an error like ""fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/SamSaffron/pups.git/': Could not resolve host: github.com"".
Congratulations! You now have your very own Discourse instance!
Visit the domain or IP address (that you set for the Discourse hostname previously) in your web browser to view the default Discourse web page.
If you receive a 502 Bad Gateway error, try waiting a minute or two and then refreshing so Discourse can finish starting.
Use the Sign Up button at the top right of the page to register a new Discourse account. You should use the email address you provided in the DISCOURSE_DEVELOPER_EMAILS setting previously. Once you confirm your account, that account will automatically be granted admin privileges.
Once you sign up and log in, you should see the Staff topics and the Admin Quick Start Guide. It contains the next steps for further configuring and customizing your Discourse installation.
You can access the admin dashboard by visting /admin.
If you don't get any email from signing up, and are unable to register a new admin account, please see the Discourse email troubleshooting checklist.
If you are still unable to register a new admin account via email, see the Create Admin Account from Console walkthrough, but please note that you will have a broken site until you get normal SMTP email working.
That's it! You can now let users sign up and start managing your Discourse forum.

"The Three of Pentacles is a tarot card that show up to assure us that step by step methods of gain pay off. It’s a card where collaboration is queen. It’s a card where slow and steady really, really does win the race. After an Ace of sudden news and opportunity and a Two where things look a little less steady, this Three promises that the effort you put in after the Ace pays off. Working with others is also well-aspected, and long time dreams of collaboration often come to fruition. In The Spiral Tarot, one of my oldest and dearest decks, we see a ballerina being applauded and praised for their work. I’ve internalized this card as also meaning then that the right people are paying attention, and that’s what will lead to your day in the spotlight. Ballet is tedious, hard work and it’s easy for dancers to feel disheartened or discouraged. Yet here one is, with every bit of that work paying off because someone saw enough in them to grant them a role where a whole room full of people would stand up and applaud. It’s a beautiful card, and one I’ve cried upon receiving. This work might feel thankless, but your loved ones, your superiors at work, your favorite diety–they’re watching, and you’re going to be so thrilled that you took all the right steps to get here.
As an LGBTQ+ person, this card does lend itself to the activist collective in spite of the microcosmic nature of the Pentacles suit. Brick by brick we are building a better world. Little by little, the people in charge are noticing. Piece by piece we are covering up the scars that our kyriarchy has left on it’s individuals. That’s magical. It’s also logical. Along this line, when we’re talking about resource building and giving back to our community, this card urges us not to get discouraged so easily. Maybe no one hears about your space or opportunity at first, but a Three of Pentacles tells you stick with it. The right people will hear about it, and you will end up giving back and making your mark in your community.
Because this suit is so personal, I have seen mountains be moved in client’s families of origin with this card. There are clients who get a lot of pushback on their identity from their family but who don’t want to give up or disown those people. No one HAS to make that choice, but it is a totally valid (and totally human) one to make. The Three of Pentacles does promise those querents that the work of trying to open those hearts and minds will pay off, and better yet, assures us that you have allies in the situation even if you didn’t know that.
The Three of Pentacles is one that really does almost always show up regarding career. It has definitely had those other manifestations I’ve talked about, but nine times out of ten, this is a career card. Many of us who are LGBTQ+ have our identities built into our career or branding, or are professional policy makers and activists. This card essentially promises that those were worthwhile chances to take. We see the right clients coming to us, the right supervisors paying attention, and we see that other people’s identities or allyship come to our rescue and push us from where we are to the next step. This is a card where I urge people not to hide in their careers. It’s a card of assets, and trusting that the assets we are using will bring about the conclusion we desire. We are our own greatest asset though, and the Three of Pentacles promises we can put our whole queer selves in the spotlight and come out with the stability and career growth we crave.",en,books

"90 Day Korean’s Inner Circle is an excellent course that is split up into four 90-day modules. They do an exceptionally good job of simplifying the materials and explaining things in a straightforward way. Plus, you’ll get access to a personal coach to ask any questions you may have and get feedback on assignments from. I came away very impressed when I tried the course myself. Read the full review.
If you’re looking for something like Duolingo but better, try out LingoDeer. The Korean course teaches grammar and vocabulary up to TOPIK 1. Beginners can benefit massively from various exercise types, natural recordings, detailed and clear grammar notes, built-in reviews, and offline mode. Read our review of Lingodeer.
An one-stop solution for all things Korean – over 1000 lessons, organized in eight levels, numerous video courses and podcasts, over 25 reference books and work books… No matter your current level and learning style, you’ll surely find what you need. Plenty of material is free, including some podcasts and accompanying ebooks, and a popular Youtube channel.
The Pimsleur method is somewhat different than others and works well for some people. You learn to speak the language by listening, imitating (syllable by syllable) and answering questions. The lessons are 30 minutes long, require full concentration, and you speak throughout. The phrases you’ll learn are neutral and appropriate in any situation, and the grammatical constructions are limited to those that you’ll most likely to use. You can attain almost good pronunciation, sufficient vocabulary, and high self-confidence as you speak. The Korean 1-2 courses cover the beginner’s and intermediate levels, and each contains 30 lessons. Read our full review of Pimsleur.
It is great to have a native speaker to practice Korean with you from the first day. If you don’t have someone already, you can find one – a tutor, teacher, or a language exchange partner – on Italki. Chatting with a conversation exchange partner won’t cost you money. Lessons from professional teachers will, but you’ll spend significantly less than you thought you would. Also, if you are a native speaker of a language other than English, you can find someone who speaks your language too. Read our full review of italki.
Memrise courses are fairly fun. Most of them are generated by users, and the quality varies, but when you pick one, learning the lessons is like playing a game. The concept of the app will make you memorize words, phrases, spelling, and pronunciation. You can choose from hundreds of courses or create your own. Best of all, Memrise is completely free to use. Read our full review.
FSI language courses were developed by Foreign Service Institute – U. S. Department of State using the FAST methodology (Familiarization & Short-Term Training). The FSI Basic Korean covers the essentials comprehensively, and includes textbooks and audio recordings. Korean Headstart Course is more concise and includes self-evaluation tests. These materials are considerably old and a bit old-fashioned, without any interactive solutions or flashcards – you might even need a teacher to guide through – but they are very thorough and entirely free.
A comprehensive Korean language-learning pack from Innovative Languages, which includes everything a beginner (or intermediate-level learner) needs: audio and video lessons, flashcards, and downloadable PDF lessons. You’ll find tons of helpful content and while the platform isn’t perfect, they offer lots of useful materials at a reasonable price.
Viki is an Asian drama streaming service, so you’ll be able to find tons of Korean dramas to watch. They’ve also added an exciting Viki Learn feature which sounds like a great addition for Korean learners. You can click on their dual-subtitles as you watch to see a pop-up definition of the word and save those words. Additionally, there are listening, fill in the blank, and vocabulary quizzes based on the K-Dramas. Finally, their video dictionary lets you look up a word in English or Korean and watch clips that contain that word.
The creators of LingQ promise you’ll never need a boring textbook again. The natural process of learning through context is more pleasant and surprisingly more effective than memorizing grammar rules. You can pick the content you find most interesting – and the choice is large – and read and listen to the subjects that interest you. They may try to do too much, from language exchanges to avatars and coins, but the reading section, which is LingQ’s main feature, can be a really useful tool. Read the full review of LingQ.
There’s one level of Rocket Korean, suitable only for beginner students. Consisting of interactive audio lessons, language and culture lessons, writing lessons, and survival kit lessons, it appears to be a well-round and comprehensive course. Unfortunately, I came away from my time trying it pretty disappointed. I wouldn’t recommend paying for it. Read the full review of Rocket Korean.
One of the most popular free language sources, Duolingo offers fun, bite-sized lessons of Korean. 5 minutes a day is supposed to be enough to develop solid reading, writing, and speaking skills. It is easy to use and it feels like you’re playing a game. Unlocking new levels and earning virtual coins keeps you motivated and, if we are to believe to the authors, 34 hours of Duolingo are equally valuable as one semester in the university.
Glossika is another course that promises to teach you Korean without memorizing the rules. The keyword here is internalization – you internalize grammar rules and adopt the patterns of speech, by repeating the most commonly used sentences in the Korean language. However, not everyone would be thrilled with the study material – it consists of isolated sentences, without any context or story – but many say it works for them. We’ve found it to be overpriced for what is offered. Read our full review of Glossika.
At the moment, there is over a twenty different Udemy courses of the Korean language available. The quality varies, the price not that much – most of these courses are offered at the discount price of $11.99. It is hard to tell whether all of them are worth paying, but there is something for everyone. All levels are covered, and some of the courses have quizzes included.
This app is quite different from the “canon” language learning resources. It is a compilation of videos in Korean (among other languages), supplemented by the interactive captions, so you can have a pleasant time watching interesting stuff and learning on the way as if you had someone to explain everything to you in real time. Unfortunately, I was pretty unimpressed when I tried FluentU. Read our full review.
A fancy language learning software and app that nearly everyone has heard of. It may also be known as one of the most overpriced apps that offers considerably less than many free ones. You can start with a trial version and actually learn several nice phrases in Korean, but the lessons that follow – which you’d have to pay for – won’t help you move much. However, if you’re struggling with concentration issues and love to learn in tiny steps with lots of (often unnecessary) repetition, you may wish to try it. Read our Rosetta Stone review.
Probably the best language exchange platform – a mobile app that allows you to connect with native speakers of the Korean language, chat with them, and help them acquire a command of your native language in return. It supports text, voice, and video; contains tools for pronunciation, translation, and corrections; is free and easy to use.
Live Lingua is an online language school. The tutors are native speakers and certified teachers of Korean. The lessons are on the more expensive side – $24.99/hour and that’s if you book 40 classes at once. You can try it out first though with a free demo lesson. They’re a bit different than other online language schools in that they use all public domain materials which typically just consist of the FSI courses.
A popular program that enables you to learn many things using flashcards and spaced repetition, and is especially convenient for language learning. You can use an existing deck, created by some of the users – and there are over hundred shared decks for Korean – or create your own. Anki is an open-source app that works on most of the operating systems, and enables you to sync your decks across devices.
Clozemaster is a great way to practice vocabulary, sentence structures, and reading by completing tons of fill in the blank exercises. You can fill in the blank by either typing the answer or choose from a multiple choice option. You’ll score points as you go. While there is a pro plan, the free version offers a ton of value. You can learn Korean from English, French, or Arabic.
This app aims to enable you to learn Korean from any of the 33 languages that they support. The learning starts with listening to a conversation, memorizing core words, and using them to generate other phrases and sentences. At the end of a lesson, you are supposed to be able to reconstruct the conversation. Unfortunately, we weren’t very impressed. Read our review of Mondly.
The Living Language Korean comes as the Complete Edition and contains three Books (beginners, intermediate, and advanced level), nine CDs, and free online learning resources: games, flashcards, and interactive quizzes. The Platinum Edition also includes live e-tutoring. There is also the Essential Edition coursebook available for beginners.
If you love Assimil, you’ll get dissapointed to hear that their standard course of Korean is only in French. However, they have recently published a handy Korean phrasebook for the speakers of English. The book contains 21 lessons for beginners and mp3 audio sample, so you’d need to buy entire audio content separately.
If you aren’t sure how to pronounce a certain word or phrase in Korean – from greetings, apologies and flirting (Do you have a boyfriend? – 남자 친구 있어요?) to whichever expression you may find in the book you’re reading – you can type it down in Forvo, and hear it pronounced by a native speaker.
A comprehensive, innovative, and practical reference guide for intermediate and advanced learners of Korean. It covers both traditional grammatical categories and practical language functions including all those situations that are vital for communication. There is an accompanying workbook available too as a separate item on Amazon.
A community-driven Q&A site for teachers and learners of many languages, including Korean. Anybody can join and discuss the delicacies of the language and individual expressions. You can ask questions, offer the solutions for someone else’s dilemmas, and vote for the responses that you find the best. The most helpful entries are voted up and appear close to the top of the thread. It is free, but it is not for beginners; you’ll need some command of Korean to participate in the conversation.
For those who are not very self-disciplined and are only efficient under pressure, “Fluent in 3 months” offers a crash-course that aims to help you develop a ‘mission-mentality’ and strategize your learning. The 7 lessons consist of bare essentials and shortcuts, but the fact that you have a scheduled conversation with a native Korean speaker in a week creates a sense of emergency and keeps you super-motivated.
Audible is Amazon’s audiobook service and also an excellent resource for learning Korean. Although there is currently no great sellection of audiobooks in Korean, you’ll find several courses from popular language learning resources such as Pimsleur and Innovative Language (Korean Clas 101). Best of all, you can get a 30-day free trial which includes two free audiobooks!
A 5-minutes-a-day app that helps you memorize words (mostly nouns) with the help of simple visual illustrations. Includes games and exercises that cover vocabulary (matching word and image), spelling and translation. It feels effortless but it is efficient and you do learn those words, but without any context or grammatical construction.
While most language learning apps focus on flashcards and memorization, this one utilizes a different approach. It lets you learn the language naturally by simultaneously reading and listening to various stories in Korean and your native language (as long as you speak one of the 13 languages they cover at the moment). This way, you learn words within a context and internalize grammar rules at the same time.
Readlang Web Reader is an extension for Google Chrome that enables you to read online content in over 40 languages. Korean is still in a beta phase, but it is perfectly usable. Just click any word or phrase and you’ll have it translated and saved in the flashcard library. The free version is limited to 10 phrases a day, while the number of individual words you can translate remains unrestricted.
Lingbe is a language exchange platform that’s a bit different than the others. With Lingbe, you don’t need to find someone to talk with, you simply click the call button and they will connect you with a native speaker of the language you’re learning. That can help get rid of some people’s anxieties and time wasted finding someone to talk with. After the conversation, if both people click the like button, you’ll be added to each other’s friend list and you can chat with them anytime.
This is a social network for language learners. You can find a language exchange partner based on your interests and goals. Learning can be done through chat, audio and video within the app itself.
Verbling is a good platform for finding tutors online and you can book lessons directly from the teacher. You can see how many lessons each teacher has given, their rating on the site, and a short video introduction of their experience. However, prices are higher and the number of teachers lower compared to italki. Read our review of Verbling.
This browser extension for Chrome makes it much easier to look up the meaning of words in Korean (and other languages) while reading online. A tool like this can make reading challenging content much more manageable.
Flowlingo helps you to immerse yourself in a language via tv shows, music, books, blogs, and more. You can highlight sections of text and get translations. It is still quite new and has a lot of potential for improvement. Korean is only available in the free mobile app.
Preply is a global platform that allows you to find a Korean tutor from the country of your liking. You can find a number of qualified teachers and pick one according to your needs (business/conversational/intensive Korean, lessons for beginners or children) and budget. They use Skype, which allows you do speak, write and share materials with your tutor, just like you would do in a classroom.
You can save 30% on your first lesson by using the link below.
A database of materials such as vocabulary and grammar reference, native-Korean pronunciation audios, and tools, which include a dictionary with audio, translation helper, audio flashcards, and a romanization tool. Monthly subscription is $4.95.
A popular Korean language learning guide that aims to demistify the language – mostly the Korean script (Hangul) and the grammar – and help you internalize the logic behind it, which is, according to the authors and many reviewers, surprisingly simple. This is not a standalone resource and, despite the subtitle (Mastering Conversational Korean) and the downloadable audio, it isn’t comprehensive enought to enable you to really master conversational skills, but it is a solid introduction for any beginner.
A comprehensive guide through the Korean language for beginners. Includes detailed, easily compherensible explanation of the grammar rules and forms, and over 600 essential words and phrases. Hangul (Korean characters) is used rather than a romanized script, and you’ll earn to use it too.
This well-known platform curently hosts two Korean courses. First Step Korean and Learn to Speak Korean 1 are developed by Yonsei University, cover all aspects of the language, and include quizes and role-plays. The later is more comprehensive, focused on conversation practice necessary for daily interactions, available in languages other than English, and it requires a basic knowledge of Hangul. While most of the course materials are free, you’ll have to pay if you want a certificate.
Three books covering Hangul, the Korean vocabulary and grammar, culture and history (and everything in between) in three levels (beginners to advanced) and the blog by a long-time language learner with a BA in Korean. Uses plain English to explain often confusing concepts in the Korean grammar. The books are around $20 each on Amazon, and there is plenty of material free on the website.
Quick mnemonic course designed to help you learn how to read and write Hangul, pronounce Korean accurately, and keep it all in your long-term memory. Includes full diagrams (stroke-by-stroke) on how to write each letter.
Complete work book for upper-intermediate and advanced learners of Korean, who aim to take their language skills to the next level, avoid common mistakes, and develop a deeper understanding of the language.

An unfinished wiki-style website with some cool free materials, including vocabulary (body parts, subway announcements, internet slang), grammar, and tools (Hangeul assistant).
Another convenient compilation of essentials in Korean. Helpful if you’re visiting Korea, but insufficient for those who wish to gain comprehensive knowledge of the Korean language and grammar. Popular phrases are accompanied with variations, as there is always more than one way to say something. This site can help you practice pronunciation, but it is not interactive and requires you to go back and forth until you lose your patience and go to another site.
Another free app from the Duolingo team, for those who love bite-sized lessons, spaced repetition and gamification. You can pick from the endless list of Korean flashcard decks, or create your own. The app is fun, easy to use, and available on all platforms.
A phrasebook app for iOS and Android that helps you to pronounce and memorize the most common words and phrases in Korean. Includes clear audio and you don’t need internet connection to practice the language.
Another free app for beginners that can help you build an essencial vocabulary base. All entries are followed by audio recordings and work in offline mode. Lots of adds though.

A Q&A app created by the Lang-8 team. You can ask questions to native speakers of Korean, and answer those made by the learners of your language. Available on iOS and Android.
Free courses created by the Defense Language Institute (U.S. Department of Defense). The courses are thorough and intensive. The materials consist of heavy books (the basic course has over 1000 pages), corresponding textbooks and audio files. As long as you ignore the military-related content and you’re not affraid of large books, you’ll find those courses immensely useful.

"YKP (Young, Keen and Penniless): Happy New Year!
So 2011 is over! It was quite an exciting time in terms of photography. As well as the many expected technological advancments in the production of dSLRs we also saw the Compact System Camera (CSC) market spring to life, introducing a whole new exciting option for photographers. When these started showing up I have to admit I was a little sceptical- I've got nothing against small cameras but I was kinda concerned that sector wasn't really going anywhere special i.e. it was just another gimicky bandwagon the camera makers were using to stop people getting bored with their line-ups. However with the recent introduction of models like the Samsung NX200 and in particular the incredible Sony NEX 7 I think I'm converted!
As a Canon user I guess the biggest news for me was the launch of the much andticipated replacement for the EOS 1DS III, the 1DX. I was suprised (like many I imagine) at the spec of this camera, but pleasently so. The techies at Canon finally decided it was time to respond to Nikon's offering of the D3s and produce a camera that was all about low-light performance and less about pixels. What really made me re-read the press release (in AP magazine) was that fact that this camera not only replaces the 1DS but also steps up to relieve the EOS 1D IV. Interesting. Naturally this is all slightly irrelevant to me as there isn't a chance in hell I'm gonna be able to buy myself a 1DX any time soon but it still gave me a buzz to see which direction my company was heading.
So as we look into 2012 it's exciting to contemplate what the world of photography will see next!

"RICHMOND (August 23, 2017) - Today, Attorney General Mark R. Herring is warning Virginia consumers about an active fraud involving purebred puppies. When looking for a purebred puppy to add to their family, many consumers start their search on the internet, and that is exactly what scammers are relying on. Attorney General Herring's Consumer Protection Section has recently received multiple reports of consumers entering into agreements to buy a pet with a company they found online, only to learn the website and the company are a scam - and that no such puppy ever existed.
""Finding a new puppy to add to your family is an exciting time for Virginians, and the last thing anyone would want to happen is to pay hundreds of dollars to bring that puppy home, only to find out that he or she never existed,"" said Attorney General Mark Herring. ""Unfortunately, we've seen an increase in complaints about these puppy scams, and I urge all Virginians to give careful consideration to all large purchases made online, particularly if the terms seem too good to be true.""
Scammers are posing as Virginia-based companies selling purebred pets on the Internet. Consumers will often pay hundreds of dollars to bring one of these animals into their home, and discover afterwards that the company, and the sale, were fraudulent. As part of the fraud, consumers are asked-after payment for the animal is complete-to pay additional funds for ""transportation insurance,"" and told that their pet cannot be delivered until this amount is paid.
After the initial fee of several hundred dollars is paid for the animal, the consumer may be asked to pay ""pet transportation insurance,"" or other similar previously-undisclosed fees or charges.
Search for the business's name or website in the Attorney General's Online Consumer Complaint Database, and check with the local Better Business Bureau for any complaints.
If you feel you have been a victim of one of these scams, please contact Attorney General Herring's Consumer Protection Section, which helps educate consumers about fraud and accepts consumer complaints regarding a variety of issues. You may contact our office to get information or to file a complaint. Visit our website: www.ag.virginia.gov or call 1-800-552-9963 in Virginia or (804) 786-2042 if calling from the Richmond area.",en,web

"So in my attempt to do assignment two I realized creating your own code is a very hard thing to do, well at least to make the program do something really intriguing. Unfortunately I was not able to create something cool just yet, but I am beginning to understand the writing of script better.
Using SetDraw as a basis, I removed the continuous line and added two ellipses and a rectangle to form what I believe is a mock Mickey Mouse head, but I think I failed at capturing that shape. Also I added the functions loop(), noLoop() and mousePressed() which places my newly created object in about the center of the page and once clicked with the mouse, continuous movement begins.
For assignment one I chose to modify an awesome sketch one of my friends showed me from openprocessing.org. The original page for this sketch (created by BlueThen) can be found here. The code is extremely well documented with notes about what everything does. The original sketch presented is a curtain that is pulled down by gravity and gets pulled by clicks of the mouse, ultimately ripping (if pulled hard enough).
Modifying some of the ‘resting distance’ and ‘stiffness’ settings provide some of the most fun. In some cases though, if pushed to the extreme the whole curtain breaks immediately and shatters into tiny particles. The particles have a strange relation to each other though as picking up one will affect the others around it still.
The other parts I liked playing around with were the ‘gravity strength’, ‘mouse influence size’, and ‘mouse tear size’. For example doubling the gravity causes the curtain to pull and stretch really far without any interaction from the user (because of the start value of the curtain).
I found that because of the complicated script, for me and my complete confusion still with the processing language, it was near impossible to modify anything that wasn’t clearly labeled. Still fun nonetheless.
In my last post I showed a specific example of the Substrate processing sketch designed by Jared Tarbell with complexification.net. In true open source nature, I wanted to plug his website and give him the correct exposure he deserves!
Looking more into his website, you can find more information about him here. A fun fact is that he is a co-founder of Etsy.com.
Hopefully all these images and examples give everyone some great ideas for where they can take processing – That is where this website and looking at the examples is helping me with the most right now.
Looking around and exploring the world of processing on the web has led me to a ton of different processing examples. The only thing I am truly trying to find out is what are the limitations of what you can do with processing. It seems like such a simple application and language that there must be a limit to where this can take you. Here is an example “j.tarbell” made, you can find the source code and example page here.
I think the thing that intrigued me the most was that the script essentially never stops (presumably) – after 1.5 hours of letting the script run, the whole field was dense but I could still make out little lines being formed. They had the same feel as maggots moving around in a bin.
This is my first time experimenting with scripting. The first example I edited was Embedded Iteration, something simple and static. I changed the size of the window and the color of the boxes first. Then, I changed the factor by which the boxes decrease in size so that they would fill up the whole screen.
The second example I edited was Puff. This script was more complicated because it included algorithms which defined movement on the screen, so I went through changing numbers to see what kind of effects it would have on the application. The first thing I changed was the speed that the initial puff head moved in the x and y directions. Next, I changed the cell size of the other ellipses (puff body). This made the object appear more dense. I enlarged the size of the window to accommodate the increased size of the object. My next move was to change where the object would first appear on the screen. The original script designated the center of the window and I moved it to the top. Since I was generally making everything bigger, I tried to make my changes proportionate to the original example. Lastly, I increased the size of the arrays so that the object would move further distances and move across the screen quicker. Overall, the scale and speed ratio turned out to be more jittery than the original, which might have something to do with the algorithms at the bottom of the script. It looks like something moving through a strobe light rather than moving fluidly through space on the screen.
The experience trying to draw something from cero it wasn’t as easy at it seemed.
I think my main trouble has been with the punctuation marks to execute the statements and the order of the statements.
Probably have to get more used to the idea of declaration, definition, use.
Despite the obstacles, I finally made my drawing. I draw 3 ellipses, and I tried to change some parameters in each of them as the fill color, the stroke or the dimensions.
Then I also added some movement to the ellipses taking into account that they are also defined by where they are located.
Here is the result into a series of 5 images.
The two first ellipses have a variable “x” (both varies the same way) and a fix “y”.
The third one, varies the “x” the same as the other two, but it also varies the “y depending on the “x” and the “x” dimension depending on the ”y”.
This is my first time using processing, thus to get in touch with it, I’ve took an example and started changing some parameters to see what happens.
First of all I’ve changed the background and the coordinates of the rectangles.
It is possible to see how much the drawing alters just with those simple changes.
After that I started playing with other things as the location of the rectangles in the canvas or the stroke.
Till now I’ve only changed what already exists but I haven’t tried to write anything.",en,code

"When I saw the prompt for Wicked Wednesday was holding hands I just had to pen a quick few thoughts on it….
I love holding hands… Well, I love holding His hand. I think his hands are just beautiful. They amaze me with the power they are capable of and well, of course, their ability to do wonderful, delicious things to me.
We certainly aren’t one of those couples who hold hands watching down the street – however, every now then we might as we stroll in the woods or along the beach.
No, we are the couple who hold hands while snuggled on the couch or while he drives or in the morning, just after he wakes, he reaches down and picks my hand up, entangles his fingers into mine and pulls me close and every morning, that sentiment melts me even though I felt his hands on mine hundreds if not thousands of times.
There is something so raw about hands – maybe it is all those nerves endings and the little sparks that fly about the body when skin touches off skin. Whatever it is, I just love the feeling of his hands enwrapped in mine, I love how secure that makes me feel.",en,books

"I’ve always had a love and a fascination for space. My passion was intensified when a certain British astronaut, Tim Peake, sprung onto our TV screens as he prepared for his mission to the International Space Station. I followed intently and was mesmerised by his social media posts of what life was like on the ISS. I guess this then got me interested in Astrophotography and was the beginning of a new found passion of photographing the night sky.
I’m going to share a few basic tips for those of you who would love to start shooting the night sky, but perhaps don’t know where to start. It can seem quite daunting as there are many types of Astro images that you can take, with varying degrees of difficulty. Some can be captured in one single exposure, whilst others might take hours of exposure time. Some can be taken on a really basic camera and lens setup, whilst others require a telescope and tracking mount.
But, what I’m going to focus on is how you can shoot great Astro images using your Fujifilm mirrorless system. My body of choice is the FUJIFILM X-T2 . For me, I love the high ISO performance of the X-T2 and the amazing colours that the X Series can capture in the night sky. All the images in this post have been shot on the X-T2.
So, here are a few basic tips to help you get started shooting the night sky on your Fujifilm.
The most used App on my iPhone is probably PhotoPills, which allows me to plan my Astro shoots. It provides me with so much information on things like moon phases, when the Milky Way core will rise and where exactly in the sky it is going to be. This all helps me to plan where and when I can shoot.
The moon plays a massive role in the kind of night image you can capture. If you want to go after the Milky Way in all its glory, then you need to shoot when there is no moon in the sky, as the brightness from the moon will wash out detail in the sky. However, if you wish to shoot general Astro images with a few stars in the sky, then you can use the moon to your advantage and use it to side light your composition, just like you would do with the sun in the daytime. Again, a lot depends on what kind of image you want to take.
For focusing at night, you will want to switch your camera over to manual focus. What I normally do on my X-T2’s LCD screen is zoom in on the brightest star I can find in the sky and adjust the focus until the star is small and pin sharp. A good starting point is to set your lens to the Infinity mark, however, this is just a starting point as every lens performs differently. Then take several test shots, checking focus, until you are happy.
For those of you who maybe shoot a lot of landscapes, you’ll normally shoot at a low ISO, using an aperture around F11 to F16, and then use whatever shutter speed is required. With Astrophotography, things are a little different. Because you will be shooting in the dark (obviously!), you will want to shoot with a fast lens. For people who attend my workshops, I usually recommend shooting with at least an F2.8 lens as you want to let as much light in as possible. When I use the Fujifilm XF16mm lens, I can shoot wide open at 1.4. However, nailing focus is critical, so I normally stop down to around F2.
You then need to use a suitable exposure time to ensure you get sharp stars. Because we (on earth) are moving, you will find that if you use too long of an exposure time, your stars will appear as streaks in the sky instead of nice little pin points of light. The maximum exposure time you can use before getting star trails will be based on the focal length of your lens. There is a rule out there called ‘The 500 Rule’ which suggests you take 500 and divide it by the focal length (in full frame terms) of your lens to give you the longest exposure you can use before stars begin to trail. However, I have found this to be a ‘guide’ only. For most people using a wide lens, your exposure time is going to be somewhere between 20 – 30 seconds. As you start to experiment, you will find the perfect exposure time for your lens which gives you perfectly pin point stars.
Because we are limited to relatively short exposure times, we need to bump up our ISO considerably. I usually start around ISO1600 and start working upwards. Many things will affect what ISO you need to shoot at such as moon phase, light pollution etc., but once I agree on my aperture and shutter speed, it is then only the ISO that I will adjust, depending on what my histogram looks like. When I’m out shooting in a really dark sky area away from light pollution, I quite often have to shoot at ISO6400 when there is no moon in the sky. But if I was out shooting under a moon, I’ve shot as low as ISO400 before! Yes – the moon really is that bright!
Images of the night sky need to be edited slightly differently from normal daytime images, so it’s important that you shoot RAW so you can pull out more detail and colour in your final image.
Working in the dark can seem difficult, but when you’re out under the stars, you don’t want to be constantly putting on your head torch which can ruin your night vision. I suggest getting a head torch with a red light which will allow you (when necessary) to switch it on and not ruin your night vision.
As you’ll be using a good, sturdy tripod for your astrophotography, the last thing you want to do is cause any kind of camera shake. I sometimes use a cable release with the X-T2, but most of the time I tend to use the 2 second delay and the extremely useful Interval Shooting mode that is built in. This means I don’t have to be constantly pushing the shutter button!
Once you get the hang of the basic setup, you can then begin to experiment with other techniques such as shooting separate foreground and sky photos and blending them together. Perhaps these are topics for another blog post. So for now, I wish you clear skies!
Great images. I’d be interested in your settings on the images. Some look like there was some moonlight for illumination which is great for a foreground. Regarding exposure equivalence and noise…. have you found any discernible difference in images with 15 sec exposure and a higher iso vs 30 sec at a lower iso? Thanks, I enjoyed your article.
The image in the Planning section is stunning. Great composition with wonderful lines and light! Time for me to give this a go with my X-T2. As said above, would like to know your settings and lens used. Looking forward to your next post on blending images.
Great article, I’m taking my XT-2 and 16mm f1.4 to the Maldives in December and you have inspired me to try Astro photography. Thank you.
Thanks for sharing tour knowledge with us Steven. Stunning images too!
I should have read this article before I left to Yosemite last week. I found a perfect clear sky there but had no clue About Astro. So I was struggling a lot with testing. What you have to take into account is the time factor. Even a X-H1 Needs quite the same time to calc the Picture afterwards than the exposure was before. So taking one Pictures can take easily 5-10 minutes, At the end I had to stop as I was already on the Train to leave Yosemite.",en,web

"Discussion Did you see that!?
I guess I could add that in 2019 a committee could, if they so chose, to designate a waste area as a ""penalty area"" under the expanded definition of that term.
Also, I'm pretty sure touching even one grain of sand is considered ""grounding"" the club under the old rules. That's what I was getting at initally, but it appears setting up with your club in the sand is okay under the new rules. That I did not know.

Beach access, 2 pools, picnic area with grills and a hot tub are some of the many things Destin West Gulfside offers, but that isn't all. Guests have access to the Destin West bayside 700 foot lazy river, waterfall pool, marina and 2 large hot tubs.
Be the first to enjoy this piece of Heaven on Earth.
We love coming to Fort Walton Beach and we always stay on the beach side at Destin West Beach and Bay Resort. It was our first time staying in this particular condo and it was great! Beautiful view, clean, cute decor, and a perfect size for our family of 5. We would definitely stay here again. A few minor things: I do wish there would have been a guest book to sign to read comments,recommendations, etc. We all wish the larger pool and/or the lazy river would be heated for the spring time vacationers. There are other smaller heated pools and a few hot tubs, but those two pools are fun to use! They were just too chilly. We also would have liked to have had the nice, blue beach chairs and umbrella included in our rental. Overall, a relaxing, fun, and memorable vacation was had by all!
Dear Ms. Webster, Thank you so much for your excellent review of 513 Gulfside! We enjoy hearing from our guests and are so glad to know how much you enjoyed your stay! We'll look forward to having you back again soon!
We loved the condo from the time we walked through the door! It was excatly what they described and was very clean! We can’t wait to go back again next year!

Nicely decorated, comfortable condo - well stocked kitchen, beach chairs, towels and toys. Heated pools are awesome. Beautiful view.
Thank you for your kind words about our condo and the location as well as view. We are happy that you were pleased with all of the extras we placed in the condo that you could use. I am surprised by your rating for cleanliness though. This condo just went through a full week of deep clean right before your arrival. We've stopped by a few times during your stay to check on you and bring you an iron, but you never once mentioned anything about this and instead commented on how wonderful the condo was. I am wondering if you even rate the way you believe because this is the exact rating you gave us last year on a different condo. I am positive this condo was spotless upon your arrival though and will be with each guest that arrives as we thoroughly check after each of our housekeepers. We do hope to have you back as a return guest in the future, but would love it if you would address us with these issues as soon as they come up, so that (if needed) we can work to correct them immediately.
We had a great time! The place was perfect!

There are so many great things I have to say about Gulf 513! The view was STUNNING and the room was incredibly clean and well stocked. You open up the sliders and you can hear the waves crashing. We came with our 9 year old son who loved this resort!! Being able to choose from the various pools or lazy river kept him quite busy. The additional amenity of sharing the Ramada pools (and beach bar) was mint! This resort is also great for little kids as well with a splash pad and shallow pool. The condo was within walking distance of the pier and Boardwalk with a variety of restaurants to choose from along with fun night activities for adults and kids.

"Helps in tissue formation and helps to maintain proper muscle function. Magnesium is one of the most popular minerals sold, as it has far reaching effects and helps the body to metabolize carbohydrates, fats and proteins. The most common supplement forms of magnesium are the inorganic magnesium salts of oxide, carbonate and chloride, and the organic forms of aspartate, malate, glycinate, citrate and succinate. The organic forms are more easily digested and better absorbed than other forms of magnesium. NOW Magnesium citrate softgels provide a liquid base of magnesium citrate combined with glycinate and malate to produce an advanced, highly absorbable blend.
Magnesium is a mineral that is critical for energy production and metabolism, muscle contraction, nerve impulse transmission, and bone mineralization. It is a required cofactor for an estimated 300 enzymes. Among the reactions catalyzed by these enzymes are fatty acid synthesis, protein synthesis, and glucose metabolism. Magnesium status is also important for regulation of calcium balance through its effects on the parathyroid gland. NOW Magnesium Citrate softgels represent our most bioavailable magnesium supplement.

"The U.S. Department of Energy Solar Decathlon team from the University of Maryland developed reACT for a married couple living in Denver, Colorado, who remain registered members of the Nanticoke Indian Tribe. With reACT—short for Resilient Adaptive Climate Technology—these students want to demonstrate that homes can help people live in harmony with nature while at the same time harnessing her gifts of solar energy, water, and food. Designed with influences from Nanticoke and Maryland tribal traditions, reACT includes a composting system, hydroponic garden, vegetable garden, and movable “living walls” covered in plants. The project also demonstrates urban farming—an important facet of self-sufficient living.
The Maryland team invites you to think of reACT as a living organism, with six modules performing vital functions. Systems that capture and process waste, water, and energy allow the house to operate with complete self-sufficiency, and the house’s living systems are fully disentangled from structure, so the house can adapt as occupants’ needs change—for example, by adding a new bedroom module. Much more than a “one-off,” reACT is intended to serve as a seminal prototype for a ""house as a kit of parts"" design concept. This kit consists of separate components and systems parts that can be efficiently manufactured, transported, assembled, and disassembled. The intention is to create a home-building kit that can be readily adapted to a range of clients, communities, construction technologies, and ecological environments.
A mechanical core manages the flow of water, air, and energy.
A central courtyard with an operable glass roof and wall panels extends the living space and acts as a solar heat collector.
The house demonstrates urban and ancestral Native American farming with a hydroponic garden, exterior vegetable garden, and movable living walls.
A barrel composter turns food scraps into nutrients, and a composting toilet processes human waste.
A solar electric PV array with battery storage; rainwater and greywater collection and treatment systems; and a composting toilet allow the house to operate independently.
Designed with influences from Nanticoke and Maryland tribal traditions, the house incorporates materials that consider tribal environmental ethics.
An automated SmartHouse data collection and control system package enables residents to follow and learn from the data it collects and use energy wisely.
Native American home buyers are increasingly seeking sustainable housing and renewable energy technologies to provide cultural renewal, self-sufficiency, economic opportunity, and sustainable returns on investment. At the same time, Native Americans who are living in urban centers and away from their traditional lands have a hard time maintaining their traditions and cultural ties. With reACT, Team Maryland has designed a prototype designed specifically for this market. reACT is in alignment with Native American values, as is evidenced in the home’s carefully designed HVAC, water, solar, living green wall systems, and open-source SmartHouse software.
With its ""house as a kit of parts"" design concept, reACT can be readily adapted to a range of clients, communities, construction technologies, and ecological environments. The modular and disentangled aspects of reACT are important to its unique market value. The footprint of conventional housing can be inflexible; in contrast, reACT’s disentangled design allows the home’s footprint to expand or contract to meet a family’s economic and space needs at any given time.
reACT will be shipped back to Maryland, where it will live next to Maryland’s Solar Decathlon 2007 second-place house in a sustainability park to be used for research, education, and to showcase projects with regional industry and professional stakeholders.",en,reference

"Whether you would like to produce an ebook yourself or have it done for you, you are going to require a number of tools. The format in which your ebook will be delivered has to be selected. One option is to develop a compiled version. With this method, each chapter is put on its own html page, when your ebook is made. Each one of the pages are placed on your server in a folder. Finally you compile the e-book by making use of one of the different ebook compiler applications.
Another way to put together an ebook is with Adobe PDF. You don’t even need an Adobe product that is pricey to do this, as there is a great no cost tool you can use. PDF995 and PDFEdit 995 are the two recommended products which should both be downloaded. Using them is painless. Simply download and install the components on your personal computer. The next step is to click on your electronic book and then choose print from the menu of the program it was made with. A new window is going to open, where you should put in a file name, and then save it. You’ll see one more small window open, which contains an advert, if your copy of PDF995 is the no cost one. This takes place only when you generate a PDF file, so not one of your readers is ever going to see it.
Open PDFEdit995 when your file is printed, and you are going to see a short advertisement there also. You now have many editing choices. You can number your pages, put hyperlinks that can be clicked and add comments. The development of info products is significantly facilitated by the set of tools you receive with PDF995. Since it won’t cost anything, the price is definitely right. This product is fantastic to use throughout the electronic book creation process. When you wish to sell an e-book, you shouldn’t send the book using DOC files. The only time to do this is when you are supplying your customer the private label rights.
The last thing you want after putting in energy in the development of an electronic book is for another person to steal it. It involves only a little more effort to safeguard all the hard work you invested in your info product. Much fewer people will steal from you, the more difficult you make it.

"The main highlights of this year’s SOGAT event, with principal sponsors ADNOC and Occidental, will focus on the all important HSE issues associated with the sour Shah Gas Field project in the UAE.
Mega oil and gas projects will play an increasingly important role in the industry as it attempts to match global energy demands that are predicted to soar 35 per cent as the world economy and its population grows.
That was the message highlighted at Wednesday’s fourth panel session at ADIPEC 2010.
The first panel of day three at ADIPEC discussed two of the most pressing issues facing the petroleum industry: developing, attracting and retaining a highly skilled workforce and replenishing an ageing workforce with a new generation of future leaders.
ADIPEC 2010 will close its doors today following a record-breaking week that once again placed Abu Dhabi firmly under the world energy industry spotlight.

"Saturday night we went to the John Mellencamp concert at the Chicago Theater and when he sang, “Rain on the Scarecrow”*, I remember us playing that song after my dad’s funeral in December 1993. When the funeral ended, we drove aimlessly around the Green Bay farmland. The snow barely covered the ground and you could see the fallow dirt. The crops were long gone and what remained looked sad and straggly, drained of moisture and color. It was fitting for that day. During his entire life, my father never once mentioned my accident. He was doggedly supportive of me; never turned down a good idea if I had a plan to go with it. He became ill when I was only 17 , and when that happened the focus shifted to caring for him as his health and mental acuity diminished. I wish now I had the courage to ask him about the accident, to understand his thoughts and feelings. When I heard that song Saturday night, I remembered the aimless farmland drive as well as all the things I hadn’t had time to ask him before he died. I wondered then if he ever wanted to talk to me about it. Many years later, I got my answer by going to a woman who channelled guides. Out of the blue, she told me she had a message from him and I got the answers I had been wanting. It felt like a miracle. When the universe has a plan for you, there is no stopping it. Have you ever felt that?
Rain on the scarecrow, blood on the land……….
My research thus far has included requesting medical records (from doctors, hospitals and rehab centers in Green Bay), talking with brothers/sisters/relatives, friends of my parents (who died in the 1990s) and even a smattering my own friends about their thoughts, remembrances, perceptions, misconceptions. “Didn’t you get burned on Halloween when the lantern you were carrying dropped and you caught on fire?” one relative queried. “No, not at all,” I responded. And that is the most exasperating thing — trying to prove out what I thought happened with all the other red herrings. This is why I so want to see the 1965 medical records. In my mind, they will confirm the story imprinted on me since youth or they will enlighten me with new information. Thus far, the most complete written record of the story has been found in my blue baby book when my mother wrote out an account of some of the details she chose to share in an eerily upbeat way. I’d like something a little more evidence-based but I understand that may be something that never comes my way. I also understand that whatever I may find may not answer some of the questions I have — like how did I get from home to the hospital? Or, how many “debridement” procedures (peeling off of the dead, burned skin) did I have before the plastic surgeries? My questions do indeed range from the basic to the macabre. Does anyone out there have additional ideas on who, what or where I should invest some of my research efforts?",en,books
"Juan Canales-Hernandez faces a life sentence for the first-degree murder of 11-month-old RaeLynn Martinez.
After less than four hours of deliberation, a jury on Tuesday found Juan Canales-Hernandez guilty of the murder of 11-month-old RaeLynn Martinez in September 2016.
Canales-Hernandez, 25, was found guilty on all charges: first-degree murder by a person in a position of trust of a victim under the age of 12; child abuse, knowingly or recklessly causing death; and attempting to influence a public servant.
As Eighth Judicial District Judge Stephen Howard read each guilty verdict, Martinez's assembled family members gasped, clapped and wept. They passed around tissues and exclaimed, ""Yes!""
Howard turned to the jurors and asked, ""Is that the jury verdict of each and every one of you?"" They nodded and affirmed their decision.
Canales-Hernandez, who did not visibly react to the verdict, faces an automatic sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole. Howard will formally sentence him Thursday, and family members will be allowed to make statements at that time.
The verdict brought to a close a 19-month case that began Sept. 7, 2016, when Canales-Hernandez and the baby's mother, Alexa Coria, brought the unconscious baby to Poudre Valley Hospital in Fort Collins. She died Sept. 9 at Children's Hospital Colorado in Aurora. Canales-Hernandez and Coria were in a relationship at that time.
►March 30:Video confession in Fort Collins infant murder trial: ""It was an honest mistake""
The trial began last week, and the prosecution and defense presented closing arguments Tuesday morning. They finished shortly before noon, and the jury returned its verdict about 3:40 p.m.
Throughout the trial, expert witnesses testified about Martinez's injuries and whether they matched the theories the prosecution and defense presented.
Defense attorneys said testimony contradicted Canales-Hernandez's videotaped confession, in which he said he threw a 17-pound chair at the baby. They said his confession was false and the baby's injuries were instead indicative of shaken baby syndrome, known medically as abusive head trauma. They alleged that Coria — not Canales-Hernandez — was frustrated with the baby and continued to shake her and yell at her, unaware that her actions injured the child.
Prosecutors, however, said the evidence was not indicative of shaken baby syndrome, and even if it were, Coria did not have the strength, especially while pregnant, to use that much force with the child. Instead, prosecutor Brian Hardouin said, Canales-Hernandez confessed he was playing with the baby when he accidentally dropped her, then picked her up and placed her in her high chair to feed her. When she continued crying, he threw the chair at her, he said.
Norman Townsend, head of the Fort Collins public defender's office, argued that the timeline of text messages, phone calls and cell phone tower pings prove that Coria was home during the time the baby girl was injured. Hardouin said they showed the exact opposite.
That was a point of contention throughout the trial. In Coria's first statement to police, she told them she was home and in the bathroom when Martinez fell and hurt herself. Coria’s statement later changed, though, as did Canales-Hernandez's.
Coria was sentenced to five years of community corrections in May after pleading guilty for lying to police about the baby's death.
Text messages between the two displayed a discussion about the story they would later tell police. From Townsend's stance, the text messages revealed the actions of a man who was in love, who had previously told his girlfriend he would do anything to protect her after she told him she was pregnant with his child.
""He was still in love,"" he said. ""... He was still protecting the mother of his unborn baby."" The baby, however, was not Canales-Hernandez's child, Townsend added.
Hardouin, however, said the text messages revealed the actions of a man who was trying to cover his tracks after causing injuries that would result in Martinez's death.
""He's scared because he knows he murdered this child, and the way his scare manifests itself is to deceive everyone,"" Hardouin said.
""Justice shows that this man murdered an 11-month-old child while she was in his care,"" he said. ""The evidence shows that he covered it up until he couldn't anymore.""",en,web

"The single pole 100A contactor, SPST-NO contact form, has been designed for direct current loads, particularly for electric vehicle, telecommunication equiment, car batteries, trains, ships, electronic control system.
100 amps rated load current of contact circuit.
Many power consumption equipment are single-phase load, therefore, several poles of the multipole contactor can be used in parallel, such as the electric resistance furnace, welder transformer. When several poles are used in parallel, a small capacity contactor can be selected. However, it has to be noticed that the heating current of parallel contactor is not completely proportional to the number of parallel poles. Because the resistance value of moving and static contact loop may not be equal, thus the flowing current may not the averagely distributed. Therefore, the current could only be increased by 1.8 times for bipolar parallel and by 2～2.4 times for triode parallel.
Moreover, various polar contacts can’t connect or disconnect at a same time after parallel connection, so the connection and breaking ability can’t be improved.
Sometimes, several contacts of the contactor can be used in series. Due to the increase of contact fracture, the arc is divided into many segments, thus improving the arc extinguishing ability and accelerating arc quenching. When several contactor are connected in series, the working voltage could be enhanced, but it can’t exceed the rated insulation voltage. Agreed heating current and rated working current of the contactor would not change after a series connection.
It is simple to install this DC conductor if you have an electrical background. I bought this conductor for my motor home. 12 volt battery banks can put out a lot of current. You can also choose 24V or 48V to output as you need. It is a fair price for the quality!",en,reference

"As a five-year devotee of Clarisonic&apos;s original skin-cleansing device, and as someone for whom hyperpigmentation is a number one skin enemy, I basically begged Michelle to let me test the brand&apos;s newest offering: a full regimen targeted at dark spots and uneven skin tone.
The kit is comprised of three topical brightening products, a Clarisonic Aria and a unique brush head, all designed to work together to reduce hyperpigmentation. Let me tell you... it works (!!!!!).
Before we get into the review, allow me to get a little science-y on you. Hyperpigmentation is an excess of melanin (the pigment that gives your hair, eyes, and skin their colour), which can show up as dark spots on your skin or nails.
Breakouts can leave these marks, thanks to inflammation (the phenomenon is known as post-inflammatory pigmentation). But they&apos;re just one possible cause. Others include sun exposure, genetics and certain medical conditions.
Although I&apos;m happy with my skin&apos;s overall health*, I tend to get one or two hormonal breakouts per month, which, annoyingly, will leave behind some unwanted souvenirs. Hence, I am constantly fighting a face full of dark marks—they&apos;re not just bad in &apos;Harry Potter&apos;!
You probably know that I&apos;m on a constant quest to find a great foundation to cover them. But I’m always trying to address the dark spots themselves, as well. So when I heard about this brightening kit, I just had to get my hands on it. On to the review!
* I credit my Clarisonic Mia as THE miracle fix for my acne-prone, combination skin. After trying what felt like every drugstore blemish gel, celebrity-endorsed face wash, and even Accutane (which worked but has a lot of scary side-effects) to no long-term effect, I picked up a Mia back in 2010 and haven’t looked back. In addition to removing every drop of makeup, I&apos;ve found that daily use allows my products to absorb more efficiently, reduces my blackheads, and has helped minimize pore visibility and breakouts.
The Clarisonic Sonic Radiance Brightening Solution Kit.
So the Sonic Radiance Brightening Solution Kit comes with a Radiance Brush Head and matching Aria body (also known as Mia 3) in the same mermaid-pink colour, plus three products: a Skin Illuminating Cleanser, a Skin Renewing Peel Wash and a Brightening Activator Serum.
The Clarisonic Radiance Brush Head.
The Radiance Brush Head has extra-long bristles that feel super-soft on the skin. It&apos;s noticeably more gentle than the Deep Pore Brush Head I&apos;d been using before. A few stray bristles came loose the first time I used it, but it hasn&apos;t shed since.
I use the brush every evening, after an initial cleanse with Bioderma on a cotton pad. I move the brush head in slow circles around each ""zone"" of my face (forehead, cheeks, nose and chin—beware, the nose tickles!) and let the sonic oscillation work its magic.
Like all Clarisonic brush heads I&apos;ve tried, it does a fantastic job of removing all the leftover makeup on my skin. The amount of makeup that comes off is ridiculous! If your makeup stains the bristles, I find that a pump of hand soap does the trick.
This is the Clarisonic Aria—which also goes by the name Mia 3—with the standard Aria Brush Head, which means it&apos;s a three-speed brush that has a T-zone timer (it beeps when you should switch zones). I always run mine on the normal (middle) setting for cleansing, but the gentle (low) setting is great for a quick once-over in the morning, or if my skin is feeling sensitive.
The brush handle itself has a glossy seashell-pink finish, and it looks so chic alongside the matching products. Compared to my original Mia, I find the body very lightweight and the slightly longer handle much easier to hold. I particularly love the stand, so the Aria always has a place on my tiny bathroom countertop instead of trying to cram it into my product tray.
This baby holds a charge for so long that I can&apos;t even remember the last time I had to charge it. The magnetic charger is a ""USB-enabled p-Link® charger,"" which means you can plug it into the wall adapter OR charge it via USB (win!).
The Clarisonic Skin Illuminating Cleanser.
The Skin Illuminating Cleanser is a creamy cleanser designed to ""brighten and removes impurities."" I pour a pea-sized amount on the wet bristles of the Clarisonic, and run it along my face each morning.
While I haven&apos;t noticed a particular brightening effect from this product alone, I do like that it washes away any residue from my nighttime skincare products and that greasy morning sheen (does that just happen to me?). Plus, the moisturizing formula never leaves my face feeling tight or dry, which makes for easy makeup application.
Aqua/Water, Sodium Cocoyl Glycinate, Coco-Betaine, Glycerin, Sodium Chloride, Triethanolamine, Ci 77891/Titanium Dioxide, Acrylates/C10-30 Alkyl Acrylate Crosspolymer, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Benzoate, Peg-14m, Glycol Distearate, Parfum/Fragrance, Salicylic Acid, Chlorphenesin, Polyquaternium-39, Limonene, Geraniol, Ginkgo Biloba Extract/Ginkgo Biloba Leaf Extract, Linalool, Mentha Piperita Extract/Peppermint Leaf Extract, Glycyrrhiza Glabra Extract/Licorice Root Extract.
The Clarisonic Skin Renewing Peel Wash.
I&apos;m convinced that this acid-infused nighttime cleanser, the Skin Renewing Peel Wash, lives up to its exfoliation claims. The clear liquid impeccably removes every trace of my makeup, and leaves it feeling slightly tingly—as if my cells are being instantly turned over (I know, I know, it actually doesn&apos;t work that way).
I find this wash really brightens up my skin when it&apos;s looking dull after a long day, which is probably a combination of the active AHA (glycolic acid) and BHA (salicylic acid) ingredients, plus the physical exfoliation of the brush head.
One caveat: the packaging explicitly states to keep these products away from your eyes, so be make sure you use a separate, non-greasy product to remove your eye makeup. Not worth the stinging!
Aqua/Water, Coco-Betaine, Propylene Glycol, Peg-120 Methyl Glucose Dioleate, Sorbitol, Glycerin, Glycolic Acid, Triethanolamine, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Sodium Chloride, Disteareth-100 IPDI, Parfum/Fragrance, Salicylic Acid, Capryloyl Salicylic Acid, Disodium Edta, Limonene, Steareth-100, Geraniol, Linalool.
The Clarisonic Brightening Activator Serum.
I saved the best for last: the Brightening Activator Serum is the true gem of this collection. It promises to ""fade and combat"" dark spots, age spots and acne-induced discolouration, while providing intense hydration... AND IT ACTUALLY DOES!
After my night cleanse, I use a half-pump (which amounts to a small bead) on my trouble areas, namely, on both sides of my mouth and on my forehead. My skin is left feeling normal, neither dried out nor heavily moisturized.
I have to admit, I was pretty skeptical of seeing results after a decade of trying disappointing products. (Including but not even close to a complete list: Caudalie Vinoperfect Radiance Serum, Estée Lauder Enlighten Dark Spot Correcting Night Serum, Lustra 4% Hydroquinone Cream, Paula&apos;s Choice Resist Triple-Action Dark Spot Eraser 7% AHA Lotion, Olay Pro-X Even Skin Tone Spot Fading Treatment, Murad Rapid Age Spot & Pigment Lightening Serum, La Roche-Posay Mela-D Pigment Control Concentrated Dark-Spot Correcting Serum, Alpha Hydrox Spot Light Targeted Skin Lightener, Neutrogena Rapid Tone Repair Day and Night Moisturizers, and Clinique Even Better Clinical Dark Spot Corrector!) Although I read tons of glowing reviews of these products, I used each one for at least 10 weeks without any visible improvement. In the case of Clinique, it started to fade old marks, but made no difference with newer dark spots.
So imagine my surprise when after just two weeks on the Clarisonic regimen, I started to see my older hyperpigmentation starting to fade. Then, after four weeks, I realized that dark spots weren&apos;t appearing after recent zits! Do you know how amazing that is?!?!
Now that I&apos;ve been using the Sonic Radiance Brightening Solution Kit for just over six weeks, I think the significant improvement in my skin&apos;s tone is a culmination of these products working together, but I credit the serum in particular for the progress in spot-treated areas. To put it in beauty editor terms: when my bottle of Brightening Activator Serum runs out, I will 100 percent be purchasing another one.
Of the active ingredients, I think the major player in here is the lactic acid, which follows a number of moisturizers and skin lubricants (hence the hydration claim).
Aqua/Water, Glycerin, Isocetyl Stearate, Caprylic/Capric Triglyceride, Butylene Glycol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Polyacrylamide, Ellagic Acid, Phenoxyethanol, Phenylethyl Resorcinol, Cetyl Alcohol, C13-14 Isoparaffin, Stearic Acid, Palmitic Acid, Chlorphenesin, Peg-100 Stearate, Glyceryl Stearate, Caprylyl Glycol, Xanthan Gum, Laureth-7, Disodium Edta, Sodium Hexametaphosphate, Ascorbyl Glucoside, Poloxamer 184, Lactic Acid, Sodium Hydroxide.
Of course, I didn&apos;t think I could get away without a before/after photo, so here it is. Be nice!
Before and after using the Clarisonic Brightening Kit.
As you can see, my skin remains acne-prone and my hyperpigmentation is not completely eliminated from my lower jaw area. It would probably take a laser to blast the spots out of my skin. That said, the Sonic Radiance Brightening Solution Kit has made me less anxious about the dreaded dark spots that normally would take months and (sometimes even years!) to fade.
If you&apos;ve got similar skin issues to me (especially so if you&apos;re also of Asian heritage, since hyperpigmentation is a common ethnic skin issue for us), I truly recommend this skincare system as a solution to the awful acne-dark spot cycle.
Of course, the price (C$265 / US$249) is a deterrent, but I&apos;m living proof of the emotional and financial headaches of not investing in great skincare. Your skin is always worth more effort, time and money than your makeup.
I know that skin is just an organ that looks different for everyone, but metaphorically, feeling comfortable in your skin is the biggest boost to self-confidence out there. Thanks to these products, I might even go sansfoundation to the gym!
Do you get hyperpigmentation? What has worked for you? Have you tried the Clarisonic—or this kit?

Having unexpected erections, especially during puberty, is totally normal. They usually happen when a guy thinks about something sexual but they can happen for any other reason too. Unexpected erections can be embarrassing to deal with but keep in mind that you’re not alone. Your friends and others your age are experiencing the same thing. When you feel an unwanted erection coming on try to switch your thoughts to something nonsexual such as your homework, a sports game, or just try to clear your thoughts. Meditation also helps. The good news is random unwanted erections become less frequent as you get older.",en,reference
"FACEBOOK INSIGHTS GOOGLE DATA STUDIO · 5-MINUTE READ · By Miguel Cedeno on May 29 2017.
Facebook Insights is a great tool – it allows you to understand the performance of your Facebook Page. Perhaps more importantly, it also uses diverse metrics to help you improve your overall Facebook strategy. In the template we’re sharing with you in this blog post, you will be able to quickly understand how you can learn more about the people that like your page and the performance of your posts.
Previously I’ve focused on speed and talked about how to create the fastest report in Data Studio, this time we will use the help of Supermetrics to allow us import Facebook Insights Data into a Google Sheet quickly and efficiently.
Facebook Insights allows you to view the total number of “new likes” that your page is getting each month. Moreover, you will be able to see how many “unlikes” your posts received, as well as the “net likes” (new likes – unlikes) for the same period of time.
In the top right section of the image below, you will be able to understand which countries your Facebook presence is growing in. Additionally, you can discover the demographics of the audience that have liked your page. You can use the filters (in pink) to segment by age and gender simultaneously.
People that Your Posts Reach: If you launched a campaign on paid or organic channels, and you want to know which channel has contributed the most to your total posts reach, you can visualise that too. Additionally, you can learn if your posts went “viral” too with the “viral reach” metric. The viral reach metric shows the number of people that have shared your posts.
Top 5 Post Actions: Learn which post has received the most of the likes, shares and comments.
Posts Feedback: Have you wondered if your post has been received positively by your audience? This table will help you to know the amount of positive and/or negative feedback that each post has received in different periods of times.
Posts Reactions: Learn the total number of reactions that your posts have gotten. You can filter by post name to learn the specific reactions (like, love, wow, haha, sad or angry) that users have chosen when engaging with your posts.
Open a new Google Sheets file and launch Supermetrics and go to the Template Gallery.
Go to the custom URL and paste our URL above (this blog can help guide you through the process).
Be certain that the metrics have downloaded correctly and that the date range is the one you want to use.
Tip: Supermetrics will download the set of monthly data with a “|” between the year and the month, which makes it difficult for Data Studio to read it. One easy way to delete it is to select the complete column and use the function “find” to replace “|” to “ “.
Create a copy of our Data Studio report.
When adding the data sources, verify that you change the “type of month” metric into “Year Month (YYYMM)”. You can do this in the second phase of adding this data source, or when you have set up the report.
We hope that this report will help you in gaining valuable insights for the growth of your Facebook Audience. Feel free to use it and customise it according to your business needs. If this report is helpful, please let us know and we can continue creating even more.

"2015 XDubai Flyboard World Cup goes down next week, Dec 3, 4 and 5th and since this isn’t my first rodeo I thought I’d attempt to facilitate a Q&A between competitors and judges so there would be less confusion during the briefing. I didn’t get a lot of questions submitted and I’m not sure if guys just didn’t see the opportunity or if they are really feeling comfortable with the rules going into the event.
1. What are the point values of each skill. If specific points will not be disclosed, can “levels” be written so that flyers know what the judges value?
We’ll get back to the riders after the judges meeting in Dubai.
2. On the compulsory 1080 to backflip, is the athlete limited to just a 1080 or can they do a 1440 or 1800 into a backflip or even a double backflip and still get credit for that skill?
If the trick asked is a 1080 Backflip the rider must execute that trick showing that he or she is in total control when performing it. The compulsory tricks are ask so judges can compare who executes that trick better. It is not a best trick competition so the riders must execute the trick that is asked and will not get more credit for doing more.
3. Same 1080 backflip situation….is a spinning 1080 vs a lock board 1080 meet the requirement. If they both meet the requirement does one have a base score higher than the other.
They are 2 different moves and require different skills. 1080 spin is much easier to execute. If a 1080 is asked the rider must do a 1080 and not a 1080 spin.
4. Who is judging the ski going out of the perimeter. The safety ski? Two infractions and your DQ’d so it’s a real thing to watch.
One of the judges is in charge to see how well does the rider use the space.
5. About the compulsory moves: do they need to be executed as one trick, or can they be attached to combos? In other words does it count if one makes for example a backflip straight after the compulsory superman?
They can be done in combos. A separate trick is easier to control then a combo and much cleaner but if the rider wants to do combos he can.
So, there you have a few competitor questions and the judges answers. If you are unsure about any aspect of the competition, other than exact point values of tricks as the fine tuning continues I believe, then you should contact Alex or Jason on FB or post on the FF Facebook group and get clarification now.
I’m wishing everyone the best and hope your experience next week is positive irregardless of where you place.
PS. The event program turned out very nice. Thanks to all the athletes who took the time to submit their vest images. Iris Vasconez and Blaine Jeffery will have some available in Dubai so if interested in a copy talk to one of us.",en,web

"Not just a simple manoeuvre!
Generally, (and in Britain particularly because of strong winds and ridge soarable conditions), Big Ears is one of the first manoeuvres performed after school training, even sometimes during school training. For most, Big Ears is a safe and easy way to descend without reducing your forward speed.
0ut here in the Alps I frequently see inexperienced intermediate pilots using Big Ears to approach the landing areas in order either genuinely to achieve a quicker descent rate, or often I think just to practice the manoeuvre while over the landing field.
From my experience as a test pilot and having encountered recently a number of people who have had accidents due to this problem, I feel it is worthwhile pointing out that Big Ears is in fact a much more 'serious' manoeuvre than people in general tend to think.
1. Design - The flight characteristics of the glider could be on the very limit of certification regulations for deep stall recovery when brand new and flown with a pilot exactly in the middle of the weight range, but after just a few hours of use or with a pilot at the low end of the weight range the glider could show some deep stall problems. Doing big ears could just accentuate this problem.
2. Line distortion - Due to usage, lines can either shrink or stretch, again causing no problems in normal flight, but developing a 'hidden' deep stall characteristic whilst practicing manoeuvres outside the normal flight envelope.
3. Cloth depreciation � The charactersitics of your glider may change due to usage, possibly causing problems when the glider is flown outside the normal flight envelope.
4. Trim Tabs � Sometimes when on the 'slow' setting, and with the addition of one or more of the above examples, trim tabs can alter flight characteristics. Additionally, if some cowboy has added trimmers to a glider that is not certified with trimmers, the same effect can happen.
So it can happen that even your own trusted wing with which you have performed Big Ears many times without a problem, could develop a 'hidden' deep stall characteristic. On exiting Big Ears and especially if you 'pump out', the glider does not regain normal flight and instead slows down even more and then goes into parachutal mode. In this 'deep stall' you descend vertically at approximately 5 m/s (refer to previous Icaristics on deep stall).
The main problem with entering this parachutal mode on exiting Big Ears is not the actual deep stall itself, (a quick 'pump' on both brakes or stepping on the speedbar will 'rock' the glider out of it), but your not realising that fact. Your quick descent rate while in Big Ears will 'disguise' the consequent deep stall. More importantly Big Ears is usually used over landing fields or for top landing in strong wind soaring conditions, meaning that the pilot is vulnerably close to the ground, leaving very little time to react. Hitting the ground at approximately 5 m/s can cause some major injuries to the pilot, especially if the terrain is rocky or steep.
A friend of mine has recently broken his back doing this very manoeuvre. He was flying his wing that he had had for three years without any previous deep stall problems from Big Ears. He was trying to top land on his local flying site in quite strong wind, but soarable conditions and decided to pull in Big Ears to descend more easily for landing. As he exited Big Ears, his glider went into deep stall, and although he was aware of the problem, he was descending rapidly towards some chair lift cables. Not having time to 'pump out' the deep stall, he applied one brake to avoid the cables and hit the ground just next to them, going down wind and in deep stall. He broke his back on impact.
It is important to realise that on most occasions, Big Ears is a very safe method of increased descent but you should always be aware of this potential problem when using Big Ears close to the ground, not just assuming that the manoeuvre is a totally trouble free method. You should be acutely aware at all times of your rate of descent while exiting Big Ears, and be prepared to correct any sign of deep stall immediately and at a safe height above the ground.
My personal advice is to avoid using Big Ears altogether if you are less than 100 m above the ground. Above this height you will almost certainly have time to correct any deep stall development that might occur before being in immediate danger of hitting the ground.
From Cross Country magazine No. 47, October/November 1996.
In the above article, Bruce certainly highlights the problems causing parachutal stall from exiting the Big Ears manoeuvre. Note the emphasis on the ""exiting"" the exercise.
In America it seems they have similar problems: in a recent talk (December 1997) with a lady pilot from that country, she informed us that pilots there are told NEVER to do Big Ears, due to accidents occurring from this manoeuvre. In South Africa we have had a number of accidents occurring from the same thing: broken arm, twisted ankles, injured backs, etc.
Parachutal stall usually occurs when releasing the Big Ears manoeuvre close to the ground. In addition to all the possible causes described by Bruce above (with which I wholeheartedly agree), there is also the added circumstances of wind gradient and even wind shadow. Often these accidents occur on areas where there are trees and/or buildings causing wind shadow or more than usual wind gradient. On top landings they are often slightly behind the take-off, perhaps in the area where wind shadow and/or even a degree of rotor may occur.
Let us jump back a step: when one comes in for landing without Big Ears, a certain amount of surge and dive is expected and countered due to the wind gradient effect on the landing, especially in restricted landing areas. Who has not heard of pilots stalling and falling out of the sky close to landing due to wind shadow? The feeling of the ground rushing up to him makes a pilot pull too much brake too early. The ground rushing feeling is caused by increased ground speed as well as the glider diving to maintain its air speed. Once the pilot realises what is happening, it is easy to allow the glider to maintain airspeed and land properly, with flaring at the right moment.
Now we can go back to approaching landing with Big Ears: when one pumps out the Big Ears, a certain amount of surge is required to ensure that the glider maintains flight smoothly, i.e. air flow over the wing is never interfered with. However, with wind gradient and wind shadow magnifying the feeling of diving and ground rush, it is easy for a pilot to pull even more brakes, adding to the high angle of attack, and not allowing the glider to maintain its airspeed. Although in most cases this does not happen too often, as is proven by many good landings after opening the Big Ears, sometimes it happens that the pilot gets it just right to cause parachutal stall. That is when the fan starts churning real nasty!
Pilots often release Big Ears at heights between 10m and 30m above the ground - just a nice height to get into trouble with, should the glider go parachutal. There has been enough serious accidents for this problem to be taken very seriously.
It is so easy to land with Big Ears on, that I am surprised that Bruce has not mentioned it. All that is required is a good flare at the normal height for landing. The wings usually pop open perfectly and stops the pilot softly. Even if they don't (and I have never seen that happen, unless the pilot did not flare properly), it is so close to the ground that only very bad luck can cause injury, such as stepping into a hole in the ground. Should the wind be strong, then one does not need to pull so hard, as there is a danger of being dragged after a hard flare (a completely different problem, and one which all pilots should be prepared for properly). The descent rate with Big Ears is usually slower in stronger winds, especially on top landings.
Bruce advises not to do Big Ears below 100m above the ground. I want to modify this: never RELEASE Big Ears below 100m above the ground.",en,reference

"2019 Ford Escape SE Price welcome to our web fordtrend.com here we provide various information about the latest ford cars such as: Review, Redesign, Specification, Rumor, Concept, Interior, Exterior, Price, Release Date and Pictures. We hope that the information we provide can help you and make our website become one of your sources in finding the latest car information. Happy nice day!
The 2019 Escape gets updated outside styling, some minor inside enhancements, a recently accessible 1.5-liter four-barrel motor and an altered 2.0-liter motor with more power. Models with Sync 3 likewise give a possession application (FordPass with Sync Connect) and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto cell phone incorporation. Wellbeing highlights now incorporate path flight counteractive action, a sluggish driver cautioning framework, and versatile voyage control with forward crash alarm. The Escape SE with the discretionary 2.0-liter motor conveys solid increasing speed and sensible mileage without pushing the sticker price above $30K. It likewise offers different remain solitary choices so you can pick and pick highlights without selecting substantial bundles that incorporate things you needn’t bother with.
The 2019 Escape is a minimized hybrid SUV that comes in S, SE and Titanium trim levels. The S is genuinely no frills yet accompanies components, for example, a rearview camera, Bluetooth, Sync 3 tech interface and cell phone coordination. Most purchasers will need to begin with a SE, which presents another motor, more pleasant wheels, a power-movable driver seat and more accessible alternatives. The best trim Titanium includes extravagance touches, for example, calfskin upholstery, a without hands control liftgate and surrounding lodge lighting.
Every vehicle ordinarily comes in various adaptations, albeit trim levels share numerous angles. The appraisals in this audit depend on our trial of the 2013 Ford Escape Titanium AWD (2.0L 4-cyl. turbo; 6-speed programmed). NOTE: Since this test was led, the ebb and flow Escape has been changed with updates to infotainment highlights, driver helps, and another 1.5-liter base motor. Our discoveries remain comprehensively pertinent to the current year’s Escape.
Generally the inside plan bodes well and is anything but difficult to utilize. It’s stacked with highlights, as well, particularly on the Titanium trim level. The nature of materials and get together is great. Portage has made it a point to put generally utilized controls in reach and in sight, and it appears in the Escape. It may not look extremely rich, but rather everything is the place you would hope to discover it.
The seat stature in the Escape is perfect. Like entering a minivan, there’s no bowing down to get in. The eight-way control driver situate in the SE trim is a decent touch. The blend of the seat and a manual tilt-and-telescope guiding wheel makes it simple to locate an agreeable roost.
We had no issues fitting easily into either the front or back seats, yet the Escape doesn’t have a feeling of roominess like the roomier Honda CR-V. Perceivability out the front and the back are just normal. The Escape is unquestionably not as vaporous or as simple to see out of as some of its rivals.
Fabricate quality is comparable to you can expect in a vehicle in this value go. Materials seem strong and organized. Difficult to contend with the Escape’s accessible payload space: 68 cubic feet with the back seats collapsed. Not as much room as in the Honda CR-V yet keeping pace with rest of the class. The sans hands, foot-worked control liftgate additionally turns into a can’t-survive without include once you’ve utilized it.
The turbo four-chamber gives the Escape fast increasing speed. Dissimilar to numerous contenders, it never needs for control. The transmission is a smooth administrator, and the manual mode gives simple access to motor braking. The 2.0-liter EcoBoost motor is truly effective, yet you’ll pay for it at the pump. We recorded 20.5 mpg in blended driving.
Brake execution is strong and steady. The Escape was extremely steady, notwithstanding amid our frenzy reproduction ABS stops. It has a counterfeit controlling feel, which is the standard nowadays for minimal SUVs. All things considered, there’s sufficient criticism to make you feel in charge.
All-wheel-drive Escapes advantage from a propelled control dissemination framework that makes the Escape a proficient handler and also a strong all-climate decision. Front-wheel-drive Escapes likewise feel beyond any doubt footed on account of the all around tuned suspension. As a rule, the transmission reacts rapidly. It gets got level footed now and again, yet no more regularly than most SUVs in this class.
The 2019 Ford Escape lands at dealerships in May. The passage level S demonstrate, accessible just with front-wheel drive, begins at the promoting benevolent cost of $24,495, however we envision couple of clients outside of armadas will stop there, as the SE brings greater gear, the turbo 1.5-liter motor, paddle shifters, and 1-to-2-mpg better efficiency for just $25,995. Load up a Titanium show with all accessible treats and the sticker catches up on against $40,000. That is a considerable measure of cash for an Escape, yet the lower-estimated models speak to solid esteems in the portion. With the minimal hybrid section as yet growing, this less demanding to-utilize, simple to-drive, and simpler to-take a gander at Escape likely will remain the organization’s top of the line non-pickup for a considerable length of time to come.",en,web

"if I had known it would become the American Gestapo.""
Now that Federal Agents are immune from prosecution...this statement has never been more valid.
Now that the FBI have permanent offices in foreign countries and the CIA is spying on its own domestics, the immoral and unlawful American Gestapo system is well entrenched and more egregious than ever.
The CIA is a nearly autonomous agency now with its own black market funding, personal crusades, and more cases of corruption than the Nazi SS. They have been implicated in the deaths of the Kennedy's, and numerous other political leaders and government officers. They are infamous drug runners (and one of the primary reasons the drug war continues is to keep those profits rolling in) -- and let's not forget that Bush Sr. is one of them. Nasty black ops -- we would do well to be rid of them.
It basically depends on your knowledge of what is politically necessary. The government knows way more than the common citizen.
Truman did not have a period after the ""S"" used as his middle initial.
Go to his library and read the kind of stuff he said. I was not at all impressed. A lot of socialist clap trap.
Give me one example of the CIA acting like the Gestapo. DEA maybe but CIA, I dunno.
I agree, Waffler. DEA, FBI, ATF, EPA and a whole host of alphabet agencies use Gestapo tactics and are rarely accountable. The CIA operates more like a conspiracy of extortionists.
here's a snopes report on this quote.. evidently, a firm source to confirm this quote is nonexistent: ""So far no hits on the actual quote despite several different searches on a number of databases. This leads me to a number of conclusions. 1. Truman never said it. Truman is, like most American presidents, well documented, and so finding proof of a quote by him should not be difficult. His biographies are numerous, and he was not exactly known for speaking close to the chest. 2. Truman said several things somewhat like it, but not the exact phrase. Truman was plagued by regrets about his decisions as president later in life, to a degree unusual in Presidents. There were many things about the United States he was deeply dismayed by that he felt personally responsible for, and was not afraid to talk about them. 3. Someone put this together from a number of his quotes, though the Gestapo part is most likely not Truman. Nazi comparison are not something I see Truman making casually, and considering how many different ways he can be established to have been discontent with the CIA, I doubt that he would have refrained from describing them as the Gestapo in all his quotes but one, the very one which we so conveniently can not source. That said, though Truman may not have directly called the CIA the American Gestapo, he certainly didn't like what they became, and as their creator, he was in a unique position to judge them.""
The main thing I like here, and reading jonathan, above, is that we had a president with a conscience who continued to grow and learn all his life. Good ol' Harry. I love his handing out pens reading, ""I stole this pen from harry Truman"" I grew up with Truman stories like that.
@ Jonathan - I wouldn't rely on snopes to confirm that the sky is blue. It was a Mom and Pop outfit set up by California Liberals and has since been bought by a Soros owned company. Definitely left wing biased.
This is a made up quote. Truman did not say this. Way to do your research Johnathan. Smart.
CIA is a private corporate owned intelligence service and they don't only work for the US.
""Give me one example of the CIA acting like the Gestapo.""
I can give you many, where in countries where we side with an oppressor, the CIA hands them lists of thousands of names of union leaders, student activists, academics, lawyers and others to be abducted by the state for torture, prison and execution.
BTW, while the quote above was largely Truman's sentiments, I don't think it's an accurate quote.
He did, however, write an editorial on December 22, 1963 criticizing what the CIA had become.",en,web

"Deus Ex Machina is a live, choose-your-own-adventure performance that gives total control of the play’s storyline to the audience.
Deus Ex Machina rips characters from Greek mythology and throws them into a gladiator ring. Through the power of Zeus, the audience is transformed into gods and battle it out like clashing titans to determine the fates of the infamous characters of the House of Atreus: Agamemnon, Clytemnestra, Electra, and Orestes. But no matter what the audience chooses, there are consequences, and not all of these characters will make it out alive.
Deus reformats the epic Greek tragedies of The Oresteia, giving the audience unprecedented theatrical power to control the very trajectory of the narrative through real-time digital interaction. This malleable roller-coaster of a narrative ultimately tracks to 1 of 12 potential story lines, plus even more opportunities to exercise dramatic omnipotence for 12,288 possible experiences. (Seriously. We’ve done the math.) Want more control? Dig a bit deeper and find a few hidden easter eggs that allow audiences to invoke the power of Mount Olympus.
Part real world video game, part Tarantino revenge flick, you’ve never seen Greek drama like this before. When was the last time you played god?

"Back in April, my roommate and I headed to Tulum for a little spring break (WHOOOOO).
Aside from the very friendly beach waiter who became Logan’s best friend, what I appreciated most about PPP was their breakfast menu. Tulum is generally celebrated for its “wellness scene,” but I wasn’t anticipating the level of healthy awesomeness I would be presented with every morning. I’m talking all manner of fresh juices and smoothies, whole-grain pancakes, gluten-free granola with coconut yogurt, and a magical assortment of cold grain bowls loaded with fresh fruit and homemade coconut milk.
I was a big fan of the overnight oats and a magical smoothie involving coffee and bananas, but the sleeper dish that really blew me away was the quinoa breakfast bowl. A not-too-sweet porridge with quinoa, coconut milk, fresh fruit and nuts, it was loaded with refreshing flavors and had the most addictive texture. It was weird but in a good way, and I couldn’t get enough.
When I returned home to the polar vortex after four days in the Mexican sun, I missed many, many things about Tulum, but this badass breakfast was at the top of my list. (Second only to spicy Salty Dogs and watching Logan splash in the ocean.) Sadly, I had to wait a couple of months for the temperature in NYC to creep above 65 degrees, but when it did, I wasted no time whipping up my own Coco-Berry Quinoa Bowls.
A couple quick notes and you do you options before you hit the kitchen. First, I like red quinoa for this bowl because it’s a little bit heartier/nuttier than white quinoa, but either will work. Second, this bowl is very lightly sweetened. If you have a sweet tooth, play with the quantity of maple syrup until you find your sweet spot. Finally, feel free to get creative with toppings! Mango and macadamia nuts is a great combo, and I’m a sucker for sliced strawberries and banana with a little dark chocolate. A dollop of coconut or Greek yogurt is also great if you want porridge with a creamier texture and some tang.
Now go forth, and quinoa bowl, friends! I’m very excited for you to experience the magic. For the full recipe, hop on over to FromThePod.com.

Observations on rearing Acanthopsyche atra L. (Lep.: Psychidae) from ova, and of adult behaviour, are presented. The species exhibits strong protogyny, a behavioural mechanism believed to prevent inbreeding, as might be expected in a species with poor ability to disperse. The moth is considered to be overlooked rather than a genuine rarity. The cases, and male and female adults are illustrated in colour.

The behaviour of the Square-spotted clay Xestia rhomboidea, a UK Biodiversity Action Plan moth species, was investigated in Cambridgeshire and Essex during a three year period. Larvae were found on 30 different occasions at 16 sites; larvae wre also discovered at two sites in Scotland. The main larval foodplants were Common nettle Urtica dioica, DogÕs mercury Mercurialis perennis, Oxlip Primula elatior and Primrose Primula vulgare. The larvae were observed in the wild between the 10 January and the 12 April and could be found from dusk onwards feeding at the top of the larval foodplants. Adults were observed nectaring around dusk and later caught in light traps around dawn, mainly in August. The woodlands between Cambridge and St Neots seem to be a stronghold of this species which was found on ride and woodland edges of not only ancient woodlands, but also in secondary woodland, recent plantations and shelterbelts.
Changes in the distribution of butterfly species are presented from the London area for the period 1980-2000. Most species (65%) became more widespread, including some habitat specialist butterflies, but a few show substantial declines in distribution. Although incomplete data prevent a systematic assessment of the biasing effects of recording effort variation, other data are presented (e.g. from abundance monitoring, national distribution trends and site colonisations) to suggest that the distribution changes are genuine. Some of the possible causes of these patterns are discussed.

number of columns present at one time was 22. Estimates of the numbers of thousands of larvae present in four columns of different sizes were about 5, 8, 16 and 26; and the highest total present at any one time was about 110,000 - 220,000 larvae. Column fronts moved at 1-2 cm/min, but larvae on the upper surface of columns moved 3-4 times faster. Columns were most numerous in the mornings. Two unbroken rings of marching larvae were seen, one lasting for more than 24 hours. A few huge linear deposits of frass were found that must have been caused by intense synchronised defaecation by larvae in a column. Individual larvae measured during the study varied between 3 and 11 mm in length. From 20 July - 4 August, mean larval length increased from 6.3 to 8.4 mm and mean mass from 3.7 to 5.9 mg, although on any day there were large variations in both quantities between columns and between larvae. Possible reasons for column formation by these larvae are considered.

Moth trapping using a Rothamsted trap has taken place on the Writtle College estate in Essex since 1968. Over the period 1968 to 1993 moth species richness and abundance was generally on the increase, but trapping ceased in 1993. It was restarted in 2000 and over this second period moth species richness had fallen by 21%, but catch abundance has increased by 25% when compared to the first period. This was not in line with national data, as overall Rothamsted catches have fallen by nearly one third.

"On behalf of The Law Office of Lynnette Ariathurai, A Professional Corporation posted in Mergers & Acquisitions on Monday, December 23, 2013.
The Internet has quickly become an important component for just about every industry. Companies everywhere are becoming more and more web-based, which has fueled a need for freelancers looking to work remotely or from home. This has prompted the growth of websites designed to connect freelancers to potential employers. Now two of the largest websites, both located in California, have finalized a business merger deal aimed at better connecting employers with freelancers.
The two companies, Elance Inc. and ODesk Corp., are planning to combine into one business entity, which will service 8 million registered users . The current CEO of Elance will lead the newly formed company. The name of the new company has yet to be announced, pending completion of the final details of the business deal. The CEO of ODesk will be kept on as a strategic adviser.
The shift in how people now do business has resulted in a large market for Elance and ODesk. Approximately 20 to 30 percent of the workforce in the United States are freelancers, temporary workers and contractors. Upon completion of the merger, both of the websites will remain intact while the new company will maintain both headquarters locations in California.
When two large industry players like these California web companies combine in a business merger, it can be highly profitable for all those involved. However, it is important that the terms of the legal agreements between the two parties are made clear with properly drafted legal contracts. The correct legal paperwork must also be filed with the appropriate regulatory agencies.",en,web

"Amrar Chutney or আমড়ার টক ঝাল মিষ্টি চাটনী is probably the most ordinary condiment in a bong thali, we can almost have it weekly. On the other hand everybody loves Kancha Amer Chatni (raw mango chutney) unfortunately which lasts only for summer days due to unavailability of mangoes. And here Amra or Wild Mango becomes the hero to keep us fulfilled throughout the year in absence of real mangoes.
Amra or Hog Plum is a tropical fruit with sweet & sour taste which is widely available in West Bengali, India & Bangladesh. This fruit resembles raw mangoes that is why it is also known as Wild Mango in Indian continent. Amra is treated almost like raw mango in bengali households and several delicacies are cooked/prepared with this wild mango in absence of real mangoes. Most popular ones are Amrar Chatni, Amrar Kasundi, Amrar Curry, Amrar Tok Jhal Achar etc.
This particular Amra Chatni tastes a balanced combination of sweet & spicy with subtle undertone of sourness from fresh amra. The sticky dark chutney has a distinct flavour from panchforon, perfumed with fresh ginger and further spiced up by bhaja masala. These typical Bengali spices/spice mix actually help Bengali food stand out in the crowd.
Watch detailed Video of Amrar Chatni or Wild Mango Chutney Recipe.
Serve Amrar Chatni or Wild Mango Chutney cold or at room temperature. Chutney doesn’t taste at its best when warm or hot. Chutney gets thicker & sweeter once come to room temperature or chilled (not frozen).
Amra Chatni tastes best after a hearty meal of bhat, dal, Aloo Posto, Macher Jhol (rice, lentil, potato in poppy seed curry and fish curry). Or after simple Mangsho Bhat (Chicken Curry Rice) on Sunday meal.
Soak the hog plums in water for 10 mins at room temperature. Wash and clean amra thoroughly; rub the skin and wash again. It will help to wash away the tartness of amra.
Peel the skin of amra and chop into halves or quarters, depending on the size.
Heat mustard oil in a wok until oil turns pale yellow.
Add panchforon and dry red chilli and allow to sizzle.
Add freshly pounded ginger and fry for 30 sec.
Pour the chopped amra into the wok and fry for 2-3 mins.
Add turmeric powder and fry for another 30 secs or until raw smell is gone.
Pour water and bring it to boil. Cover the wok & cook for 10 mins on medium flame.
Check whether amra is cooked thoroughly. If not cooked properly cook for another 2-4 mins.
Add sugar and mix well until sugar dissolves completely. Don't add sugar if amra is not coocked yet; once sugar is added amra will not be cooked anymore.
Bring it boil until chutney reaches to desired consistency.
Sprinkle bhaja masala on top and switch off the flame.
Transfer Amrar Chatni into a glass bowl and cover. Bring it to room temperature and serve.",en,reference

"Abstract : [en] The combination of the discrete element method and the finite element method is shown to be a suitable technique to resolve different length scales within almost all engineering problems dealing with granular assemblies, which are also in contact with a deformable body of an engineering device. The extended discrete element method (XDEM) describes the motion and forces of each individual grain within the granular assembly. Hence, the XDEM as a discrete approach accounts for each grain individually rather than describing the granular assembly as a continuous entity. On the other hand, the finite element method predicts accurately the deformations and the responding stress of the engineering device. Thus, this part of the simulation domain is efficiently approximated by a continuum approach.
The two domains share an interface which enables the employment of contact models fitting the particular behaviour of the contact problem between each grain and the surface of the device. At the interface impact forces develop which then propagate into the different length scales. Thus, the combined discrete and continuum approach now enables the tracking of both responses by the appropriate resolution. Each grain of the assembly in contact with the solid body generates a contact force and experiences a repulsive force which it reacts on individually. The contact forces sum up on the interface and cause the solid body to deform. This results in stresses which again the assembly recognise as a repulsive response.
The coupling method utilises quite naturally the advantages of both the continuum and the discrete approach and thereby compensating the shortages of each method. The coupling method not only resolves the different scales it further contributes to the efficiency of the computations. The method employs a fast contact detection algorithm, which spares valuable computation time by a fast separation of the important pairs of particles and surface element for the contact force prediction.
The discrete element method - finite element method (DEM-FEM) simulation technique is introduced with two engineering application of entirely different fields. However, both applications inherit similar physical problems of different length scales. In both cases individual particles are in contact with a widely used engineering device that is in contact with the granular material. Thus, the DEM-FEM coupling is shown to resolve the different scale responses within each domain separately.",en,academic

"Cendant Claims $90 Million Per Month in Web Sales - InternetNews.
Cendant Corp., formerly CUC International, said that in a typical month, Cendant's sites, which include apartment classifieds site Rent.Net, generate $90 million in sales from 60,000 transactions.
Scott Melland, vice president of business development for Cendant's interactive division, highlighted the company's emerging e-commerce strategy during a keynote speech delivered at Cowles/Simba Information's recent Inside the Yellow Pages conference in La Jolla, CA.
Cendant currently has 72 million members for its traditional and Internet membership programs, according to Simba Information Inc.'s Yellow Pages & Directory Report newsletter.
The Internet offers traditional marketing companies a more profitable way to reach and retain customers, Melland said.
Cendant Corp., formed from the merger of CUC International and HFS, operates more than 50 Web sites that support its existing real estate, travel and entertainment discounts membership businesses, including the Entertainment books and Traveler's Advantage. Its flagship Web site, NetMarket, charges $69 per year and allows members to choose from about 1 million items at near-wholesale prices.
Cendant does not receive any transaction revenues, but instead relies on increasing its membership to grow revenues, Melland said.
Melland said the Internet is a cheaper method of signing up customers compared to Cendant's traditional methods, which include use of direct mail pieces and catalogues. He also said that the cost of servicing Internet customers is about one-third of the cost of traditional customer acquisition, since customers purchase directly from the site.
Melland also said Cendant makes a profit from Internet customers during their first year of membership while it takes two years generate a profit from a traditional member.
""Online marketing works, it's just very difficult,"" Melland was quoted as saying. As an example, he said a ""successful"" banner ad seen by 100,000 people would result in about 20 to 40 buyers. For an ad that cost $20 CPM, every buyer would need to purchase $67 worth of merchandise to make up the marketing costs.
Melland said that Cendant is able to negotiate low CPM banner ad prices and pays some sites only for the number of visitors and/or purchases made from a click-through. The click-through payment ""essentially offloads a lot of the risk we have,"" he said.
Melland said he sees a bright future for e-commerce and that from his experience, he believes the market is growing much faster than what the analysts are reporting. ""When online commerce works, it's a beautiful thing,"" he said.",en,web

"Transmission: Automatic Color:Black Interior Color: Gray Average Vehicle Review: (4.287 reviews) I loved the look of the 2013, Ford Escape. When I drove it the first time, I thought that it was a really fun car to drive. It was clean and had all of the features I was looking for in a car� However, I purchased the car in November of 2015; I sold the car February 13, 2016. In that time, I learned that FORD stood for, �Fix or Repair Daily�; because, in the time that I owned the car, it was towed twice. It had service or repair issues at least four times! The Check Engine light kept coming on, so I took it back to Car Max. The reality was, the car was at Car Max almost � of the time that I owned it. On February 13, 2016, I traded the car in for a brand new Jeep! I haven�t looked back since!

"Brandel Chamblee is known for bringing the heat as an analyst on Golf Channel. Despite what his critics think, Chamblee has the game to back it up.
On Monday the 56-year-old, who was on assignment last week for NBC Sports/Golf Channel's coverage of the Open Championship at Carnoustie, qualified for the Senior Open Championship with a two-under 69 at Scotscraig in Tayport, Scotland. Chamblee earned medalist honors, and will play in this week's tournament, which will be at St. Andrews for the first time in its 31-year history.
Chamblee, who won once on the PGA Tour in his career, walked away from professional golf in 2003, talked with Golf Digest this spring about his desire to return inside the ropes, saying the Senior Open at the Old Course “was too strong a lure to ignore."" While he's very aware his play will be carefully watched, he doesn't seem too concerned.
“I get a chuckle out of people who try to denigrate my career,” Chamblee told Golf Digest. “I was an extraordinary golfer. I say that with all humility.

"Being classy is all about style, elegance, sophistication, polished etiquette, grace and finesse. And if your realize, there are barely any shortcuts to achieve that. To be classy, you need to invest more efforts in grooming yourself from within than just blowing tons of cash in expensive apparels and accessories. You do not need to have the perfect hourglass figure or chiseled physique or have all the luxuries in the world to be classy. Classiness is about being refined, about carrying yourself with grace and doing things with panache. It is not always about what you wear. Rather it’s about how you present yourself that determines your classiness. Your lineage, social savviness, values, manners, hobbies, speech, achievements— all go on to add to your swish. Having a seven-figure salary may be enough to take you to the world of luxury, but it certainly isn’t enough to make you any classier. Agreed, being able to afford luxuries helps you learn how to be classy. However, it does not make a person advanced. A classy person is special. Trail the list to know what it takes to be classy and posh.
There are few battles, which are worth fighting. Stand up for those people who cannot stand for themselves such as mentally disabled, animals and children. If a person is rude to you, just ignore him/her or better, wait for yourself to calm down and address your issues to that person. You can also treat them in a polite manner by making it clear that you do not encourage what they do, without being hurt. Always remember not to stoop to their level and make nasty comments about other people. Always be in the company of polite and positive minded people who encourage your classy and intelligent lifestyle.
Being fashionable is a necessity. Try reading more fashion magazines to understand the kinds of clothing that go well together and how to put together a classy outfit. Make sure that you develop your own fashion style and make your own posh statement. Avoid anything which you feel doesn’t compliment you. It is advisable to have a personal style than chasing a ‘fad’ look.
Always remember to be clean, comb your hair, keep your nails nicely trimmed and dirt free, brush your teeth and take a bath. While spraying perfume, make sure you use it sparingly. Disproportionate use of perfumes is not attractive and will not enhance the hygiene. Being clean is very important and being filthy is not agreeable.
This shows your politeness. If you speak loudly, it seems that you are desperate to get attention. Being loud in public places is not horrible, but you must be considerate to the people who surround you. Always listen what people have to say and ensure you make an eye contact while communicating.
For women, ensure you wear the suitable jewellery. There are numerous fashionable pieces, but there are some pieces, which do not go well with some outfits. For example, using evening gown along with a cheap plastic jewelry will ruin the classy effect of the gown. The accessories must be worn with the appropriate outfit, which makes the dress classy.
For men, it is not professional to have a beard. Keeping a beard is just unethical and creates an impression that you are too lazy to shave. If you have a mustache, you can keep that, but ensure that it is orderly and clean.
Make sure you walk with elegance and sophistication. Do not keep your nose in the air and your baby finger pointed outwards. You must walk with smooth steps without waving your arms back and forth. You clothes must not be flying around, your chest should not be bouncing up and down and the hair must remain in place. This is walking in an elegant and classy way.
The classy person listens more than he speaks. Developing a strong vocabulary is very important, but never use a word unless you are sure of its meaning. It is also important to correct others while they speak improper grammar. Differences in language, family life, background and education force people to speak in a different manner. Moreover, it is very much embarrassing to be corrected by a know-it-all.
Intelligence is the key for a classy person. You need not be a bookworm to be intelligent and need not show off. However, ignorance about current events does not make a classy person. You must have a basic knowledge in as many subjects as possible as it will make you come across as someone intelligent and well informed.
There are situations where you feel the need to put your foot down and scream. The advice here is not to lose control and have a mindset, which allows moving forward and not damaging your relationship with people unnecessarily.
Proper etiquette while dining out at a restaurant or while sipping a tea is necessary. Posture, manners and grace is essential to show your classiness. If you need to cough, you can use a napkin and if you burp, you can say an ‘excuse me’. If you are listening to someone else, turn your head towards him or her. Etiquette is just a matter of common sense.
Picking up a thing which a lady drops, holding a door open, giving flowers for no reason are some good deeds which shows that you have class. You can volunteer your time at nursing homes, hospitals and in libraries, which shows that you have class and you are giving back to your community at the same time.
Make your inner sophistication and stylishness stand out by dressing better, following proper etiquette, using sophisticated language and giving right body signals to others. It will make you classy.",en,reference
"ISHAD is a multidisciplinary international symposium devoted to the presentation, discussion and publication of scientific studies and original researches on disaster science and engineering.

New or small businesses turn to alternative lending for fast, no-hassle sources of funding, but bankers are urging them to read the fine print first.
If a small business owner is considering borrowing money, it helps to understand how a banker thinks.
Gulf Coast Bank CEO Guy Williams said the results reflect continued strength in small business lending, highlighting loan demand among businesses supporting natural gas extraction and the wave of natural gas processing plants to be built in south Louisiana over the next five years.",en,web
"Items contributed by Dave Grohl, Chris Cornell, Elton John, Iggy Pop and others are being used to make watches to help raise money for musicians' drug addiction treatment.
The musicians, also including Nirvana bassist Krist Novoselic, have given items such as guitar straps, flannel, plaid flannel shirts, denim jackets and leather pants to the California-based watch maker Nixon for its Rock LTD Collection, which will use the materials to make straps for a line of watches whose proceeds will go to the MusiCares MAP Fund, which helps provide addiction therapy treatment for musicians.
Nixon is creating up to 30 watches that will be released this fall and sell for $1,200-$1,800 in its stores in New York, London and Paris. The Cornell watch, made from a guitar strap, will tour the stores before being auctioned off during a MusiCares benefit in May.
Cornell was a longtime supporter of the MAP Fund and had agreed to donate the strap before his death in May; In a statement his widow Vicky says that, ""Addiction is a disease, and we lose far too many loved ones to the illness each day. MusiCares is a crucial organization and the MusiCares MAP Fund 100 percent supports the music community in its fight to protect those battling this affliction.""",en,web

"Here, you'll find the answers to email's persistent questions, and some insights into how the email tool works.
Why is my query total higher than my sent email total?
The query tool works as a selection process, pulling everyone who meets the criteria of the email blast. However, the blaster only loads those records with valid, active email addresses. Unsubscribes, inactive accounts, blank email addresses, and email addresses without proper formatting will not be loaded into the blaster.
Why does my email to my Yahoo! account look different than the one to my Gmail account?
E-mail clients vary in how they accept some formatting, especially in css. As a result, code that may be supported by Gmail, may not be supported by Yahoo!, Hotmail, Outlook, or Thunderbird. Send test messages to as many different email domains as possible to check for these problems.
Why does the preview look different from my test email?
The email preview will view the email in a web browser because code is viewed differently by different email providers. What may be valid code in a browser may look different in an actual email. Use test emails to confirm how your email will appear.
I want to change my template for this blast. How do I do that?
You can only switch from an UNeditable template to another UNeditable template. Go to the eblast, select another template, and click save and continue on both the template AND content pages.
Why is my blast scheduled in the past?
If you copy and recycled an earlier eblast, It will appear as being scheduled when you sent out or scheduled the original blast. It will still send out when you schedule it.
How can I compare the effectiveness of my emails?
Use the Summary Report to compare open, clickthrough, and conversion rates for each email.
Why do emails to mobile device users have such a low open rate?
In order to track the email, images must be downloaded when the supporter receives the email. Since most mobile devices receive email in text-only format, the images are not included, and the open is not counted in the Salsa database.
Why are people receiving blank emails?
Make sure you have checked on the validation page that your email content passed the Microsoft check, as Microsoft Word-generated code can lead to blank emails. Also check to make sure that you have included text-only content in this email blast.
Why are images from my email not displaying?
This can occur for a variety of reasons, but most often it has to do with the settings of the user's web browser (like Firefox, IE, Safari, Chrome), email client (like Outlook, Thunderbird, etc.), email provider (likeYahoo!, Gmail, Hotmail), or any combination. These settings are always set by the user, but some combinations default to NOT display images. Consult your browser, email provider, or email client help to adjust these settings.
Why is someone whose record is unsubscribed still receiving emails?
The supporter is most likely subscribed using another email address that feeds into their original unsubscribed address. Check your records using search for supporters for any other records with the supporter's name, or similar email addresses.
Why is my email sending out late?
Salsa's email processors can sometimes be clogged due to volume, slowing delivery of emails. All Salsa contracts allow for a 3-hour window past the send time to complete sending an email blast. If your email blast is taking longer than this, please contact support. There may be elements in your email content causing a delay.
Why have some targeted supporters not received the email when the email blast appears as Completed?
""Completed"" indicates that the email blast has completed sending from Salsa's email send servers. A supporters recipient email servers may delay delivery of an email to the supporter's inbox due to volume on the email recipient servers, errors in the html, or for spam filtering purposes.
Is there a way to automate a welcome series for new sign ups?

"Fort Collins, Colorado lies at the base of the Rocky Mountain foothills. This also happens to be where East Moon Asian Bistro & Hibachi is situated. Opened in 2008, the restaurant instantly became one of the most popular restaurants in Fort Collins, despite the economic crisis that was gripping the nation at that time.
Located amongst several grand commercial buildings and within walking distance of several residential areas, East Moon satisfies the appetite of not only office workers, but also those living in the surrounding neighborhood. To cater to the demands of its legion of loyal customers, the restaurant offers both dine-in and take-out service.
You will never miss the restaurant, as there is a manmade waterfall out front. Upon stepping into the restaurant, customers will be enchanted by its modern décor. A feeling of freshness washes over the customers as they marvel at the unique details present throughout the interior. Those who are interested in art will be happy to see a number of modern art pieces hanging on the wall. The décor is mainly of Western style and East Moon and thus has become a special place where East truly meets West.
The spacious 6,000 square feet dining area is able to seat up to 225 customers. Nevertheless, the restaurant is always crowded during lunch and dinner time.
At East Moon, a fusion of authentic Asian cuisines is served, including Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, and Thai cuisines. On the menu, you can see many familiar dishes, but when they are served, you may find the dish is different from the versions you are familiar with. This difference in both taste and look is something the customers really have become enamored with and so the twelve chefs at the restaurant continue to introduce new, innovative selections.
General Tso’s Chicken is one of the most popular Chinese dishes in America. But the version served at East Moon will be definitely beyond your expectations. You will find that snow peas and carrots are added to enhance the flavor of the dish. It will be an adventure for you, and you may just absolutely fall in love with it after one taste.
Another dish that often astonishes new customers is the Vietnamese Rice Noodle Bowl, which is quite different from the usual Vietnamese Pho served in other restaurants. As is known to those who are familiar with Vietnamese cuisine, Pho should be noodles with soup, but that isn’t the case at East Moon. The Rice Noodle Bowl is served with dry noodles and Thai chili sauce, which is made of roasted chicken, roasted shrimp, carrots, and white turnip. It has now become a must-order for many patrons.
The amazing flavor of each dish is, to a great extent, due to the fresh ingredients. “We purchase ingredients every day and only the quality ones make it into the kitchen,” says Jason Zhou, the owner of East Moon. Although the cost of the ingredients is quite high, the prices on the menu are still reasonable.
Healthy food is another highlight of the restaurant. Sushi is rolled with brown rice, which is healthier. The dishes aren’t greasy, and only olive oil is used in their preparation. Fabulous and eye-catching in presentation and appearance, the dishes are more than enough to satisfy even the most jaded foodie. Every dish is a work of art. The colorful sushi comes in various shapes, with dishes featuring heart-shape rice with a cherry on top, as well as edible flowers. These little touches have an impressive visual effect and are often commented about by customers.
To make their dining experience a more enjoyable one, customers are encouraged to watch the hibachi show, which features the unsurpassed skills of the restaurant’s hibachi chefs. Half chef, half showman, the chefs dazzle patrons with their repertoire of awe-inspiring knife tricks and affable nature. Those seated at the hibachi table are first greeted by the chef who socializes with their audience before beginning a culinary show which culminates in the delivery of sizzling stir-fry creations to each person’s plate.
The beverage selection with its wide variety of drinks has something for everyone. You can rest assured that no matter what you like, you can find something at the bar. The friendly bartenders treat customers like family and have a keen knowledge of how to mix just about anything.
“Our top priority is serving our customers the types of dishes they are looking for. This is why we have so many loyal customers,” asserts Jason. The staff is friendly to every customer and is always attentive without being intrusive. At East Moon, customers can feel free to make requests, as the staff is so dedicated to keeping everyone 100% satisfied.
One of East Moon’s regulars, a high school student, loves East Moon so much that he wrote an article on the restaurant. The report was published in the local newspaper. Jason feels thankful that the young boy likes his restaurant so much and the experience of seeing East Moon written about in such a positive light has given him further motivation in his work.
Jason, who has been in America for 16 years, has experience working in Chinese, Malaysian, and Japanese restaurants. Busy with managing the restaurant, he seldom cooks now, but still happily returns to the kitchen when patrons ask him to cook for them. As a boss, he is both strict and considerate to his staff. “To ensure the clean sanitation of the restaurant, managers are assigned to inspect everyday. Staff will be rewarded if they do their part well,” explains Jason. The staff is rewarded quite often, as they take delight in serving customers and enjoy working for Jason.
You will never know how tasty the food is unless you come and have a taste. Jason and the friendly staff will always be ready to offer you a spectacular dining experience.",en,web

"Sewing needles have not changed much over the millennia. For a flexible fabric thread sewing needles are good. Obliging fabric thread can easily double back 180 degrees and pulling a double wide piece of thread behind the needle does not require an overwide hole thru the fabric.
Other types of thread are less obliging. Plastic or polymer threads like nylon do not double back easily; likewise metal, leather and especially glass. Surgical needles accommodate this by having the needle attached to the thread. This is fine for them as the needle is a single use item anyway.
The chuck head sewing needle has a grabber at the top and a screw fitted collar. As with a drill, screwing the collar down opens the chuck to receive the end of your thread. Screwing it back up tightens the chuck. Now you can sew with a hole only big enough to admit your needle and thread end on.
[+], but the chuck mechanism is going to have to be extremely slender.
We consider that the best solution would be a sleeve, that slides over the point on the needle and then runs up the shank until it compresses the ""jaws"" of the chuck. There could be machined grooves in the inside of the sleeve and a ridge on the jaws to engage with it.
A special tool might be needed for small needles.
A lot of my students end up working as fashion designers, so I know a bit about the stitching business. My mum was also a stitcher. Changing needles is a pain in every circumstance that I have seen. What is needed is a two part device. You slot the needle into one part, away from the machine, then you attach that part to the machine via a really simple mechanism. This means that several needles could be preloaded.
//A lot of my students end up working as fashion designers// That's sad. You'd expect that at least a few of them would be able to get jobs.
/best solution would be a sleeve/ I thought the threads might be necessary to keep it in place. I can envision the sliding sleeve but not the ridge. How would you disengage the ridge on the jaws?
There is an awful lot of polishing involved in making a needle. Even the slightest roughness on the surface causes it to grab and tear at the fibres it's supposed to be sliding through. The exterior of your chuck will need to be very smooth.
A possibly more practical option would be just an axial hole in the back of the needle, that the thread stuck into, using a glue that could be dissolved later.
//Simone Rocha// Never heard of him.
Be curious. You'll find it an interesting experience.
Well, a quick Google only turned up a ""Simone Rocha"" who designed some dresses. If there's an important or useful ""Somone Rocha"" that I'm missing, let me know.
Life is very short. And there's no time. For fussing and fighting, my friends.
/glue/. The glue would stick onto an area the circumference of the end of the thread. I worry that tiny area will not be enough to support a force able to pull the thread.
The exterior of the chuck should be covered completely by the smooth surface of the device used to tighten or loosen it.
no no no, [bung]. The entire point of life is fussing and fighting. It's, like, the whole basis of evolution.
How do you feel? SEW SEW.
The limiting factor is the diameter of thread so the needle with the new method has to be slightly bigger.
How about an internal cleated tube. Poke in the thread so it never pulls backwards. Of course their needs to be a hole, further down the needle, to push out an old color/type allowing for a new thread.
Getting the thread into the shaft of the needle is going to be tricky - trying to push a diminutive, limp object with no mechanical strength into an aperture can be problematic, as [MB] will testify (although he says he has tablets for it now).
Wetting the tip and twisting it in will create a bit of compression stiffness and get it there.
Yes, apparently he tried that, but he hurt his back and needed to rub special ointment on the affected part, too.
//trying to push a diminutive, limp object with no mechanical strength into an aperture can be problematic// Yes, but it was even more problematic to get you out again.
The thread needs a thread.
Yes, well, we should have guessed that you family's idiosyncratic version of ""Hide and Seek"" would be weird in the extreme.
If the needle were a hollow cylinder, the thread could be sucked into the shaft by a pressure differential between the rear and the front. Once through, the sharp point could be pushed into the cylinder, trapping the thread in place.
The idea could be tested with a vacuum pump and a hypodermic needle.
There shouldn't be a problem pushing the thread into a hole in the end of a needle, since this needle is only designed for thread that isn't very flexible. If you're using flexible thread, stick with a standard needle.
What scad said! I did not even think of that obviousness.
If you want the needle to grip the thread, check out a leatherworking lacing needle (it's hollow, and threaded inside - screw it onto the thread) or a 2-prong lacing needle (the back spreads open, put the thread in, and squeeze the jaws shut on it).
If the needle was basically a tapered hollow cylinder, the thread could be pushed into the end, and then the assembly rolled to a smaller diameter. Rolling, as opposed to crimping, would keep a smooth surface. A once only operation.",en,reference
"This post was supposed to go up before January 1st, but didn’t on account of me not writing it yet. With mere days left to the end of the year, I caught a cold and ended up going to the living room to hide away from the chill in my room under a pile of blankets with a warm heater nearby and a steady supply of citrus drinks to try and burn out this snotty bug. Today, it seems like I can breathe without drugs, so I’m declaring a tentative victory and venturing into my cold, cold room to finally do this post. This is my dedication to you. Witness my love for alla y’all.
How to begin? Well if 2014 was one of my better years, 2015 was certainly one of the worst. Right at the start, my husband contracted a staph infection and had to be hospitalized. Before the doctors could identify the strain, it had already gummed up the stents in his heart, and he had to undergo open chest surgery. He was moved from one hospital to the next, and no one had any answers about how effective the treatments were or when he might finally come home. Even after we had an answer, the doctors kept changing their minds and pushing it back. Poor hubby looked like a pincushion, and he endured so many treatments that eventually the doctors ran out of viable locations to put in new catheters.
Some of you may recall this, but I have multiple sclerosis. I’m mostly fine unless I move around too much. Well for the first two and a half months of the year, I did more moving around than I had in all of 2014 and 2013 combined. It wasn’t just travel to and from the hospitals, either. I had to wash hubby’s things and cart them back and forth. I had to clean the house and care for the animals, all stuff I’d normally done with his help. And when hubby got home, he needed a lot of help with everything. So even if I was exhausted and in pain, I just kept pressing on.
And then I got sick, and that was the final straw for my body. I still have not recovered from the strain, neither mentally nor physically. I can only do a little housework before I need a long sit to recover. I have brain fog even under light mental stress, so I haven’t been able to write or edit much. I haven’t even been able to read, so while in 2014 I hit a new record of 50 books completed, in 2015 I barely managed 20.
Sales were crap, to say the least. Part of that has to do with me not having the energy to get out there and promote my titles, but the other problem lies in my shrinking social reach. It’s been massively difficult to get any message out on any network, and even harder to get my titles reviewed. Amazon’s changed the rules for what books get shown to customers, and now I apparently need more reviews to be seen. In short, all the ways that I’d been using to improve my visibility in previous years have dried up in 2015, and so my one release of the year slipped out like a squeaky fart at a death metal concert.
I can’t promise anything at this early stage, but I really hope to get back to a more regular posting schedule soon. True, it will be mostly book reviews, mainly because I’ve got a huge TBR pile to work through and an empty bank account ensuring there can be no new game purchases for a while. But who knows? Maybe my next few books will sell enough for me to have some free cash again. Even if they don’t I’ll still try to keep the reviews coming somehow.
I want to close this out by thanking the people who have stuck with me this year. I know I didn’t have much to offer you, often going silent for weeks at a time. But you’re still here, still checking in, and I really do appreciate it. To you I wish you a great new year, and I hope to keep you entertained, or at the very least morbidly amused throughout the coming months.
Happy belated new year, y’all. Let’s make it a year worth remembering.

"Expectations: I’ve seen this a bunch of times, I expect to still enjoy it.
Fargo is a twisted tale that begins with a disclaimer that it is based on a true story. The Coens put this on their film because there are certain elements taken from true events, but the actual overall story is theirs. This doesn’t diminish its impact at all, in fact, it’s such a well-written story in its probable improbability that you can easily believe it to be true, which in the world of film is all that really matters.
Jerry Lundegaard (William H. Macy) drives down a snowy road to meet two men at a bar. He has hired these men to kidnap his wife, in an effort to get her wealthy father to pay the ransom which Jerry will use to pay off debts and then give a small share to the kidnappers. It’s all so ludicrous that it has to be true, right? I mean, you can’t make that kind of stuff up.
William H. Macy is perfect in his role as Jerry. He plays the small-time auto salesman in over his head to the letter and you almost feel sorry for the guy when his plan starts to go South. When the criminals you’re hiring to pull your jobs are questioning your motives and the viability of your plan, maybe you should rethink it. But not Jerry Lundegaard. See this plan will work… it’s a good one I tell ya, you just gotta do it like I say. His crackpot scheme remains riveting, even after multiple viewings.
Steve Buscemi and Peter Stormare are like the criminal odd couple, stuck together whether they like it or not. Often when I watch this film, I wonder how they met each other. They are such polar opposites of each other and their scenes are filled with conflicts over the most minor of things, such as stopping for pancakes now or later. These are some of the funniest and most enjoyable scenes in the movie, as two great, relatively unsung actors are handed a great script and they absolutely run with it.
The true star of this film, though, is Frances McDormand as Marge Gunderson. The choice to write a pregnant woman character into the role of the town sheriff on the hunt for the criminals is a stroke of brilliance and something I doubt we’ll ever see again on screen. It’s a choice that’s truly inspired, but easily could have been corny or ridiculous. McDormand is so charming and has such an air of wit and power about her though, that she is ultimately believable in her role and not a thing seems forced. John Carroll Lynch is perfectly cast as her husband as well, and the scenes they share possess a true sense of marriage and love and, like everything else in Fargo, is incredibly believable. This is one of the great on-screen relationships and every time I watch the film I am re-enamored with it. Little things like that are what sets Fargo apart from the rest of the fairly tired, standard thriller genre. Such care is placed on every minute detail, making this one of the most re-watchable movies of all time.
On top of all of this is the beautiful photography of Roger Deakins, one of my favorite cinematographers. He skillfully captures the desolate, snowy landscape of Brainerd with calm, crisp shots that tell a story. There’s a great shot early on of Jerry talking on the phone to a GMAC lender who needs some auto serial numbers from him. It is a revelatory moment for the viewer as a background piece of info as to why Jerry is trying to get his hands on some money is revealed. The scene is shot through the office’s open window blinds, which as the camera moves closer become nothing more than vague, out-of-focus vertical bars, suggesting that Jerry will not pull off his plan and will end up in jail. It’s a subtle use of visual symbolism that works well without seeming heavy-handed.
Throughout the years, the only piece of the film that perplexed me was the Mike Yanagita character. I could never quite understand why he was there, other than for possible straight comic relief. This time around, I think I figured it out. His character states that he recently lost his wife. He’s in a desperate, lonely state and reaches out for the loving Marge in an effort to reclaim some part of his past that is still alive. Marge isn’t able to reciprocate, but she is ultra-polite about it and continues their get together. My mistake in trying to figure out Mike was that I was always asking myself, “What does his character tell us about Marge?” This time I noticed how as a man who has lost his wife, he can be placed alongside Jerry instead. Mike is a man who has lost the woman he loved, despite his best efforts, and Jerry is the complete opposite. He is a man who would do anything, even have his own wife kidnapped, just to not look bad. The most chilling example of Jerry’s cold-hearted nature comes in a scene when he comes home after Jean has been kidnapped and practices the distressed, manic voice he will use when he calls her father.
This is where the Coen Brothers struck their first motherlode. Their previous films are all good in their own ways and each has their set of fans, but for me, Fargo is the first Coen masterpiece and it’s one of my favorite films. If you haven’t seen it, do yourself a favor and take a trip to the cold, barren wasteland of Brainerd, MN.
I’ve never seen that first movie poster but it’s great. I really like that design. I agree with you about the qualities of Fargo, a terrific piece of work and my second favourite Coen Bros. film. Like you discuss above, the casting is fantastic even if they are Coen regulars – Buscemi, McDormand, Macy – just seem made for these roles. This is my fave performance by McDormand.
Yeah I love that first poster. I hadn’t seen it in years until I was searching for the images.
What’s your favorite Coen Bros? I think my #1 is a three way tie between Fargo, Lebowski and No Country. If I were to make a list, I think the Coen’s films would be the hardest for me to put into an order. They’re all different and great in their own ways.
I think this is a brilliant film, and you do a great job of analysing why. The Mike Yanagita character confused me too, but I think your idea about this character makes a lot of sense.",en,books

"The city shone some light this week on its proposal to develop “a social services and housing campus” on a large tract of land recently purchased from London developer Shmuel Farhi.
City manager Wendell Graves updated council at Monday’s reference committee meeting on the development process at 230 Talbot Street which will be undertaken in three stages, anchored by a new home for Ontario Works which is currently leasing space in the Mickleborough building at 423 Talbot Street, the second property purchased by the city from Farhi in the same transaction.
The city this week locked in place two more pieces of the Talbot Street West redevelopment puzzle with announcement of the purchase of two properties from London developer Shmuel Farhi.
The acquisitions are the Mickleborough Building at 423 Talbot Street – the home of Ontario Works since 2000 – and a parcel of land on the south side of Talbot St., between William and Queen streets, and stretching south to Centre Street.
While a conditional offer was announced last April the delay, according to city manager Wendell Graves, revolved around environmental issues.
An independent player in the movement of people and parcels around St. Thomas and environs since 1944, taxis branded as Cox Cabs picked up their last fare early this year.

At over 220 pages the Orchid Growers Companion by David Banks has a great range of information for orchid lovers. 50% of the pages are dedicated to orchid care advice, the other half is a directory of orchid species. At over 120 pages, this directory alone is more than the entire set of pages from many other orchid book authors. This allows more species to be described, with for example the section on Dendrobium running to 17 pages! The pages measure approx 8.5” x 11”, that’s 21.5cm x 28 cm and literally all of them are color.
The Care sections of the book tend to include an average of at least 2 to 3 photos per page, and this increases to an average of 3 to 4 photos per page in the directory section. The chapters seem to be sensibly laid out. The photographs, which are often full page, are vivid and detailed, and the tables and symbols are clear and easy to follow. The directory pages have symbols next to each species description indicating preferred light and temperature.
The book starts with 30 pages on the nature of orchids, and covers orchid plant structure, pollination, names, history of cultivation, geography locations of species, conservatory growing, and exhibiting orchids (along with competitions award schemes). The next section covers 34 pages of orchid cultivation and care, discussing where to grow (indoor or outside, in pots, on mounts or in baskets), watering, fertilizing, repotting, pests and diseases, and a full 10 pages dedicated to propagation. The pests and diseases section has a fantastic series of photographs indicating the different leaf damage caused by different bugs and viruses. The directory approaches the species in alphabetical order, dedicating approximately 200 words to describe the main features of the species. This is then followed by approximately 40 words per sub species.
The significant number of pages in the Orchid Growers Companion means it has a great balance of practical care advice, together with enough content to help you identify your orchid collection. This would be a great book for enthusiasts who have begun to get the orchid lovers bug, and want to gain a comprehensive appreciation of how many orchids are out there, and indeed how to care for them. RATING: 8/10.
This book, A Beginners Guide to Orchids by Geoffrey Hands, would indeed be helpful for an absolute orchid beginner. At 128 pages in length, the majority (119 pages) are dedicated to orchid care advice, with a mere 4 pages at the end for an orchid directory.
The initial 21 pages cover common orchid types. The next 30 pages have an interesting approach to helping you discover orchids; the reader is shown the various seasonal patterns of growth exhibited by orchids, helping you answer the question of “what’s going on with my orchid???” throughout its annual cycle….no more being alarmed if there is no bloom for part of the year! The final 50 pages cover where to grow (discussing humidity and light), watering and feeding, and a basic guide to repotting. The book rounds off by introducing you to such techniques as hydroponic growing, propagation, as well as a few pages on pests and diseases.
The pages measure 9” x 11” (23cm x 28cm), and generally contain at least 2 photos per page. Most graphics are in fact photographs, meaning the remaining page is covered in words (and few, if any, symbols, tables or diagrams). The title of the book is not claiming anything else other than “a beginners guide to orchids” – this title tends to be accurate and therefore is suited to those less experienced orchid lovers. RATING: 7/10.
Ortho's All About Orchids has a total of 92 pages. Each page measures 8 inches by 11 inches. The book uses a combination of text, thumbnail images, tables, and illustrations for most pages. All About Orchids focuses on practical growing and orchid care advice.
The first 12 pages cover an introduction to the environment that an orchid needs, discussing light, temperature, humidity and air circulation, plus advice for growing orchids outdoors. There are some useful tables of information in this book and the introduction on light has a useful diagram on the amount of light that each orchid alliance is most comfortable with. This section even shows you how to measure and monitor your light for your orchid. The introduction to temperature is similarly useful, again with a great table showing the ideal night-time temperature ranges for each of the orchid alliances. This is then followed by 24 pages on buying, growing, and routine care of your orchids. This chapter starts off with dividing the orchid alliances into beginner, intermediate and advanced orchid types, and explains monopodial, sympodial, epiphytes, terrestrial, lithophytes. The two pages on potting mediums in this chapter provides a good visual introduction to the different potting medium types.
Each topic in this book is generally covered with two pages per topic, and the sections on watering, fertilising, dividing and repotting, and propagation are all covered nicely with a combination of thumb nail images and descriptive text. There are four pages on orchid diseases and common problems and another six on orchid botany breeding and orchid identification (these pages are a good resource to gain further knowledge on orchid types, breeding, and learning the correct names of the orchid flower parts). This section leads nicely to the final chapter, the orchid gallery, which is 36 pages long. The orchids in this gallery are organized alphabetically by genus. The common features of the gallery pages discuss characteristics of both the species and hybrids for each genus, along with tips for success, and 4 to 5 thumbnail photos.
This is a good all-round book, primarily focussing on orchid care. Even the orchid gallery is written with a view to providing practical orchid advice. Having reviewed many orchid books I can’t avoid saying that if this book had double the amount of pages that it currently has, it would be one of the most in-depth practical orchid books out there. That said, the 92 pages of this book will provide a beginner a great set of practical tips and tricks to look after many orchids in their collection, and would also be a good ""top up"" tip resource for an intermediate orchid enthusiast. Indeed, Ortho's All About Orchids might be a worthy book for any orchid lovers collection. RATING: 8/10.
Orchids for Dummies by Steven Frowine is a useful starter book containing basic and practical information, especially for the first time orchid buyer. For those already familiar with the ""Dummies"" guides, this book maintains their regular and distinct style of publishing. It is user friendly, full of easy to understand tips, all written in a simple way to help you realise that some orchids are not as difficult to care for as people believe. There is no fear of the unknown as Orchids for Dummies takes you from choosing your first plant, onto orchid care, maintenance, and hopefully enjoyment! This is an excellent reference book where even the more experienced orchid growers can find some useful tips. RATING: 7/10.
The second edition of the Complete Book of Orchid Growing by Peter McKenzie Black prefers words and diagrams and is lighter than many other orchid books on photos. However, this does not mean its content is lacking. Indeed, the approximate 7.5” x 10” (19cm x 25cm) pages are richly covered in words, diagrams and tables. 152 pages in total, the first 46 pages cover an introduction to the characteristics and habitat of orchids, followed by culture and care advice covering pollination, composts, pots, watering, feeding, lighting, temperature, hybridization, and pests and diseases.
The remaining approximate 90 pages describe the particular characteristics of a selection of 43 orchid species, along with associated sub species. Not listed in alphabetical order, it’s necessary to rely on the index to find the specific care advice for your orchid. Each of the 43 species is discussed with its Etymology, description, cultivation and characteristics being covered. The book rounds off with 4 appendices dedicated to Hybrid lists and taxonomy.
For those readers who want more than what many other orchid books offer (if one prefers more written words, diagrams, sketches, tables and lists), the Complete Book of Orchid Growing is certainly worth a further look. RATING: 7/10.
The title of this book, Growing Orchids in Your Garden (by G.M Friend), sums up its content very nicely indeed! Its approach is different to many orchid guide books out there, because the author has written the book with the clear intention of thoroughly considering WHERE you will be caring for the orchids you grow. As the author states himself on the inside front cover of the book – “wherever you live, you can grow orchids”. After you have read this book, you will have gained a great appreciation of your options for growing orchids in the context of where YOU live. The book is 218 pages, each measuring 7” wide by 9” high. Most pages contain 1 to 2 color photos with the remaining half of each page containing text. After the first 24 introductory pages discuss how to use the book, where orchids grow, orchid growth types (2 excellent hand sketches show everything you need to know), orchid climates, and choosing the right orchid, the next 80 pages cover types of orchid that fall into 1 of 3 categories (Orchids that grow on trees, Orchids that grow on rocks and walls, and Orchids that grow in the ground). Each of these 3 categories has a similar sequence of pages; the author covers how to grow the orchids, companion plants, aftercare (of the tree/wall etc), and a specific and thorough selection of orchids suited to each category. Following these pages, a section covers outdoor orchid pests, including birds, lizards, frogs, and small mammals. A 4 page section on the strengths and weaknesses or orchid species versus orchid hybrids is followed by 25 very useful pages that discuss the TYPES/SIZES of orchid gardens (for example, a large garden, a sub-urban garden, courtyard and balcony gardens). This is then followed up with 15 pages on containers to use for growing orchids outdoors, covering aspects in sufficient depth to even cover pots suitable to avoid wind damage!. The book draws to a close with 6 pages on growing your orchids indoors (it even includes a section on growing orchids indoors on trees). The conclusion then leads you to the excellent 25 page long table of recommendations for growing orchids in your garden. This table is very powerful, and has column headings of orchid plant name, the garden type and climate it is most suited to, and other specific growing advice/ comments. If you are considering growing your orchids outdoors, you’ll be using this table as a reference source time and time again. The book rounds off with the usual pages of glossary, bibliography, subject and plant indexes.
If you had previously thought that it was not possible to grow orchids in your garden where you live, then a read of this book is recommended. Growing Orchids in Your Garden by G.M Friend will leave you with a greater understanding of orchid types, and where it is best to grow them in YOUR garden or home. Many orchid books out there seem to be a “read once only” category, but with this book, you are likely to be supported time and time again by its thorough and broad coverage. It certainly is a book worth seeking out. RATING: 8.5/10.
Ultimate Orchid by Thomas.J. Sheehan is a very visual 160 page book. Its larger 9” wide by 11” high pages provide plenty of space for numerous color photos per page. Indeed, almost every second page of this book has a full color photo of an individual orchid, and its opposite page has at least 3 to 5 orchid photos with annotations of at least 20 words per photo. The book would be a very useful resource for you to determine the precise species of all of the orchids you own. The first 15 pages cover orchid history, what is an orchid, and orchid classifications The majority of the remaining pages of the book are divided into 2 sections. Section 1, with its 120 pages, covers all of the major orchid alliances (paphiopedilum, cymbidium, oncidium, cattleya, pleurothallids, dendrobium, vanda, and phalaenopsis) and botanical orchids. Each alliance has a page introduction followed by a series of pages covering each alliance species and hybrids. Section 2 continues to use the large page size to good effect and covers topics on orchid conservation, media and potting, propagation and care, where to grow orchids, pests and diseases, orchid shows, awards, and collectibles. However, with section 2 only being 15 pages in total, the book struggles to cover any of these latter topics in great depth.
With almost 75% of Ultimate Orchid being dedicated to orchid alliances, this large paged color book lends itself more of a reference book, allowing you to identify the species or hybrid type of the orchids you are currently growing. RATING: 7/10.
At 256 pages, with each big page measuring 9” wide by 12” high, there is a lot of paper inside Growing Orchids by Brian and Wilma Rittershausen! The good news is that it has been put to good use, covering in equal depth both orchid growing advice and orchid types. There are 2 to 3 visuals per page (usually photos, but sometimes tables of information), but the large page size means there is still sufficient room for in depth supporting text (maybe 100 to 300 words per page). The first 45 pages cover orchids in the wild, history of orchids, and include a strong 11 page section on the botany of orchids which shows photos of various parts of an orchid in sufficient size and detail. The next 30 pages cover where to grow your orchids (indoors, outdoors, under glass) and provides advice on temperatures, methods, heating, ventilation, shading etc. This is then followed by almost 60 pages on orchid care and cultivation; many pages include labeled step by step photo guides including advice on tools, potting mediums, propagation, routine orchid care, and pests and diseases. Yet, there is still more to come, with the following 100 pages providing an orchid directory. The directory groups the orchids by “popular” and “specials/temperate terrestrial orchids”, and each group is sub-categorized by orchid alliance type, with each orchid alliance covered by an introduction page followed by numerous pages each showing specific orchids photos with approx 20 words per photo. The book concludes with a glossary, index and list of suppliers.
With its 250 large pages, Growing Orchids by Brian and Wilma Rittershausen is a comprehensive and informative book containing both orchid care advice and a suitable orchid alliance directory. Many other book are strong in EITHER care advice OR orchid directories, but this book has enough content to be strong in both aspects. This book is well worth a further look. RATING:9.5/10.
The title of this book, Understanding Orchids by William Cullina, says it all. The author certainly does understand his orchids! The book is written in the first person tense, with William Cullina describing his own orchid experiences such as “I went on to manage a conservatory collection of orchids”. This method of writing tends to really make you feel the author is offering real experience and advice that has brought him successful orchids time and time again. The book (whose pages measure approx 8.5” x 11” or 21.5cm x 28 cm) is a whopping 260 pages, with the latter 50% dedicated to an orchid directory.
The first 99 pages (with generally at least 1 color photo per page) cover in detail what you need to know about setting up a suitable environment for your orchid. It's hard in fact to find a weak area of this book – the strong sections include those 10 pages covering the vast range and features of orchid potting mediums, and another 6 on fertilizer. This section ends with a handy 3 page trouble shooting guide. Next, 12 pages are dedicated to orchid reproduction, which is then followed by an excellent 12 pages on hybridization and species.
Often guide books can make species information seem like you are learning a new language, but the William Cullina presents this section in an easy to understand format. The approximate 98 page orchid directory section has more specific care advice than many other orchid books; the approximate 2 pictures per page help you identify your orchid, allowing you to subsequently read specific advice on skill level, temperature, light, humidity, water, fertilization, potting and media. The book is rounded off by Appendices which list such aspects as taxonomy, orchid organizations, orchid competitions, and a glossary.
Understanding Orchids By William Cullina is a great book, for both a beginner and an experienced enthusiast. Indeed, with so much advice and experience in this book, if you do buy a copy, it’s likely to stay in your book collection for a long long time. RATING: 10/10.

"Our team has been instructed to help advise on a business case involving a restaurant, The Mongolian Grill. It’s owner, John Butkus, is contemplating renovations, in hopes of adding capacity and increasing revenue. There are several scenarios that are available to him. One option is to add an extra food bar. The second option is to move the location of the cooking area. He can also implement both options, if he so chooses. Our team has done the appropriate financial calculations, as well as qualitative considerations.
The new positioning of the cooking grill is estimated to save customers 80 seconds per trip waiting for an open space along the counter of the cooking station. It was also noted that the average customer makes three trips to the food preparation area during a meal.
Mr Butkus also provided the forecasted costs associated with each potential alternative. These costs are also assumed to be accurate. The food bar would cost $3,200 and the sauce, oil and spice bar would cost $2,100. Additional counter space along the cooking station has a cost of $600. The required extra member of kitchen staff would be paid $8.00 per hour while the additional cook would be paid $12.00 per hour.
We were told that the average customer spends $15.00 and that the restaurant’s profit margin is 50%.
We began our analysis by calculating the total incremental cost associated with each alternative. To calculate yearly costs, we assumed that there are 52 weeks in a year. There are no incremental costs associated with alternative 1. We made the assumption that there is currently one cook scheduled to work, and therefore one additional cook will be needed to implement alternative 3.

"Since the earliest days of the Internet entrepreneur, there have been vast shifts in ideologies about what makes for a successful online business. These shifts have been predicated by thought leaders who challenge our attitudes about financing, development, business models and the very reason for creating a startup in the first place.
Here are five investors, developers and entrepreneurs who have changed startup life as we know it.
Founder of the iconic Y Combinator startup accelerator and related aggregator Hacker News, Graham is a hero to masses of would-be startup gods. He's helped launch more than 150 startups throughout his career, and he's done so with a lot less cold, hard capital than you'd imagine. As he told the Harvard Computer Society in 2005, ""You need three things to create a successful startup: to start with good people, to make something customers actually want, and to spend as little money as possible. Most startups that fail do it because they fail at one of these. A startup that does all three will probably succeed.""
Y Combinator gathers large groups of startup teams — generally a young, developer-heavy crowd — and infuses them with advice, training and small amounts of seed capital, which let founders keep ramen on the table and prove their passion for the work over the course of a few months.
This program has spawned dozens of spin-offs around the country. More than an incubator and more than a VC fund, Y Combinator has changed how we think about timelines, road maps, the importance of mentorship, and what it means to be a lean startup. The program has also created an elite crew of alumni who still dine out once a week and secure funding for later projects based on their former Y Combinator successes.
A survivor (barely) of the 1990s dotcom boom, Calacanis is now known as one of the most outspoken, enigmatic figures in the modern startup community. As the quintessential modern investor and the fearless leader of L.A.-based Mahalo, he continues to lead by example, even as he speaks, blogs, judges and podcasts his way through the current tech scene.
Calacanis is no stranger to controversy and is usually willing to ruffle a few feathers for a good cause. Lately, he has taken a stand against what he feels are exploitative investment practices, particularly groups of angel investors who charge startups for the privilege of pitching them. What we've learned from Calacanis is that passion and conviction trump comfortable complacence every time. ""I try to scare people in the interview,"" he once said to reporters. ""I tell them this is going to be hard. You're going to suffer, but we're going to make great stuff.""
Vaynerchuk's evangelizing these days makes ample use of the phrase ""cash in on your passion."" This wine-loving dynamo created a presence — and a viable business and huge cult following — for himself on the web through Wine Library TV. He's a well-known speaker at tech and business conferences, and he's even got himself a book deal.
Vaynerchuk may not have been the first non-technical tech startup founder, but he's inspired, nay, driven countless others to follow in his footsteps through impassioned, expletive-laced speeches, and no-nonsense advice on how to get business done on the Internet. Vaynerchuk strips away the mystery of startup life by insisting that audience members owe it to themselves and the world around them to do what truly inspires them. As he often says, ""I just want people to do things they love.""
Steve Jobs showed us you can build an empire from an empty house; Larry Page and Sergey Brin showed us you can do it from a garage. But Zuck, as he is known, proved you can build the world's most powerful social network from a dorm room.
One of the 2.0 era's most well-known wunderkinds, Mark Zuckerberg has inspired legions of young folks to pursue their ambitions, whether in college or high school, and to hack away at new and innovative social web ideas of their own. He's also changed how people think about privacy, customization and a slew of other issues surrounding social networking.
How do you become a titan of Internet industry without even finishing a college degree? Again, the message remains: Do what you love. ""Like a lot of college kids,"" Zuck told Newsweek last year, ""we spent a lot of time talking about abstract things that interested us and how things in [the] world would play out, about trends in technology ... I was just building something that would let me and the people around me stay in touch. But then it just kind of grew and grew. The cool irony is that now we are able to have an impact on some of those lofty things we used to discuss in our college dorm room.""
One of the biggest differences between the dotcom era and the 2.0 era is the bar of entry for building web applications. A new generation of programming languages arose, and they were simpler to understand and quicker to compile and run, making rapid iteration in web development possible like never before. A handful of languages come to mind in this category, including Java, Ruby and Python. But we're going out with PHP's creator, Rasmus Lerdorf, as our fifth startup mastermind.
Lerdorf authored the first two versions of PHP, a language that powers some of the biggest sites of today's web, including Facebook. He also contributed to the Apache HTTP Server and MySQL projects, main components of the popular LAMP stack. Further, he champions the causes of security, optimization and browser excellence.
In essence, without developers like Lerdorf, the Internet as we know it would not exist. Yet he remains modest and, we feel, under appreciated by the masses of people who benefit from his work. ""I did not develop the PHP we know today,"" he once said. ""Dozens, if not hundreds of people, developed PHP. I was simply the first developer.""",en,reference
"The most fundamental part of any landscape project is the design. It is considered the overall “skeleton”, and is used to dictate the whole project from beginning to end to ensure that no mistakes are made and everything runs smoothly along the way. Our designers will make sure your design is truly one-of-a-kind and is exactly what you are looking for. The design process begins soon after the initial inquiry to Glenoaks is made, and is as follows.
The process begins with a one on one discussion with you to determine your wants and needs. We will present a portfolio of our previous installations to help stimulate your imagination. We will provide you with suggestions to meet your sites unique requirements. Based on your sites needs and conditions a design fee will then be established.
Our landscape designer will then visit your property to take detailed measurements and photos. A site analysis will be completed to determine any special site requirements, such as drainage or elevation issues.
With the information gathered from the site visit as well as your personal requests, we will produce concept drawings for you and your family to review and comment. After hearing your feed back we then produce a finished landscape design.
Along with your finished design you will receive a detailed cost estimate for your landscape project.
Once the project cost is approved a deposit is required to schedule an installation date.
Once the Job begins, you will be in contact with Joe continuously during the entire duration of the project. If you should have any questions, Joe or the site foreman will be there to answer all questions and or concerns personally and swiftly. Once the project has been completed, Joe will be there once again to walk through the job in its entirety to make sure everything is up to his standards.",en,reference

For example, we debate the ways in which internal processes affected the emergence of an O2-rich surface environment on Earth, paving the way for complex life. As a result, we lack a guiding theory from which we can infer the likelihood that O2 will accumulate in the atmospheres of exoplanets with slightly different mass or composition from Earth. The implications for exoplanet habitability and life detection strategies have barely been considered.
This workshop will bring together astrobiologists, astronomers, planetary scientists, geochemists, geophysicists, and others needed to develop a working theory about the complex relationships between the surface habitability and internal evolution of Earth and Earth-like worlds.
The goal is a community research roadmap and whitepaper aimed at developing a theory of planetary evolution, from solar nebula to evolving world, that will guide the search for inhabited worlds into the next generation. To this end, the workshop will be open to community participation via face-to-face attendance at ASU, and virtual participation as a NASA Workshop Without Walls.
What can we observe now and in the near future that has bearing on facets of exoplanet geophysics and geochemistry that shape habitability and detectability?
How does our understanding of planetary formation inform our ability to predict planetary compositions and hence important geophysical and geochemical parameters?
What are our longer-term observational aims and how are they affected by surface-interior interactions?
What are our limits of understanding of planetary material behaviors and surface tectonics, and how must this understanding extend and evolve to guide the search?
What are our limits of understanding of solid planet evolution and how must this understanding extend and evolve to guide the search?",en,academic
"Each time we roll out the mat and move our bodies the sublime understanding is that our mat is like a mirror. How we perform on the mat is how we perform in life. If we are hard on ourself in poses chances are we have high expectations of others and of our self in life. If we want to take strides in a certain direction it starts with the behavior we lay out on the mat and hopefully spills into our behavior off the mat. This is why yoga is referred as a ‘practice’. It is meant to be a preparation for our real life experience.
When we experience yoga in the form of asana (postures) the layout reads like written paragraph and has three separate phases. First there is the opening (breath work and warm-up) the body is next (sequence and asana) and the third is the conclusion (sivasana). The incorporation of all three phases often is what gives us the euphoria we experience upon completion of our yoga practice.
So if our practice is meant to spill into our daily living why is our euphoria a fleeting affair rather than an oasis we have throughout our day? The obvious answer may be that real life includes much more that just our individual self and there are many more balls being juggled than the steps to triangle pose. This is a very valuable response. Yet perhaps there is also deeper underlying layer that we continuously overlook in our busyness of daily life. If we were to examine our daily activities we may see that we take less time in our introduction, we focus primarily on the body, and almost always eliminate sivasana, the conclusion and most important part.
Take for example a scheduled meeting. If we arrive 5-10 minutes late were frazzled. We lack the time to set-up how we would like, to pause and think about what needs to be discussed and to simply adjust to the space we have walked into. However we do manage to ‘pull it off’ and cover the topics needed and have a general sense of accomplishment. This is the body. The meeting finishes and often one of two things happens next. We either are so tightly scheduled that we rush off to the next appointment or we convince ourself that we can squeeze one final little task in before we need to be somewhere else. There is no reflection...no sivasana.
What this creates is a constant snowball of either the mind, body or spirit trying to play ‘catch up’ with the rest of the body. The end result is that we lack presence and awareness. If this sounds familiar and perhaps a cyclical tendency that we would like to adjust perhaps begin by taking your yoga practice off the mat. in other words spend time on completing each paragraph that makes up the different chapters of your book of life.
Introduction: Breath deep. Absorb your surroundings and attune to your space. When making a meal gather the needed ingredients, set the oven temp, and pull out the pots and pans.
Take Sivasana. Reflect for a moment or two on what you just did. Was it rewarding?, Were your needs met?, Was your relationships fulfilling. etc. It may mean sitting in your car for a few minutes before turning the engine and driving off. It could be hugging someone you love and watching them walk away. Savoring your meal by actually tasting your food.
It seems small and simple but it contains the potential to bring purity or Saucha into the everyday and at the end of it all isn’t that why we love our yoga?
When the journey of mindfulness calls there is a deep feeling of both commitment and optimism. However the beginning stages of this path can sometimes shine it’s light on where we fall short in behaviours and relationships both within ourselves and with others. For some this is where the journey ends. Old habits and patterns enter back in, or worse we spiral into a spiritual darkness replaying the story of our short comings and limiting beliefs. What appeared so clear to us when we started is now so very far away from the direction that we were headed on. Yet if we were to listen a little closer we’d actually see that were are right on course.
The word ego often times has a negative perception, a part within ourself that needs to be conquered. The ego is so incredibly amazing. Here is this piece within ourself whose sole purpose is maintaining our survival. It acts in order to protect us and keep us safe…just like a loving mother. Yet like a loving mother the ego can be blinded. Where behaviours were once put in place, in order to keep us safe or maintain our survival, they may still be playing out even years after the threat has left.
When we turn our attention into the practice of soul or spirit we begin to shift from the need to do (ego) and start to experience the state of being (consciousness). At our core we are human beings not human doers.This shift sends the ego on high alert because the ‘law of maintenance’ states that ‘that which we feed… grows.’ If we are no longer feeding the ego and instead nourishing the spirit then over time the spirit will begin to flourish and the ego will diminish. The ego feels this threat coming on and like a mama bear finds the resources within us to preserve our survival. Ego preservation will transform in many ways such as the inner critic, the skeptic, or the image consultant.
So step back into the scenario of where an individual is embarking on a spiritual path but rather than feeling the euphoria and enlightenment sensations they begin to feel the opposite. The inner critic may enter speaking statements of unworthiness “I can’t believe you just behaved like that…and you call yourself spiritual”. Or perhaps the skeptic enters “really you think waking up at 6 a.m. to meditate is the secret to peace?” Then there is the image consultant “hmmm wonder what Larry would think if he knew I was listening to Deepak Chopra”.
These responses are not a signal to wave the white flag and admit that we are unable to lead ourselves forward. They are instead the perfect opportunity to begin the honest work of bearing witness to our own ego and engaging in relationship with it. The inner critic when used in the right manner can be such an amazing driving force to help inspire higher standards; to no longer be content with playing small. Engage in conversation with your own critic. “Really you think I’m unworthy? Hmmm that’s interesting because my kid thinks I’m awesome and my kid is one of the smartest people I know.” Or “How can I be unworthy if I was born whole? This unworthiness must have somehow been taught to me along the way” The skeptic when used honestly is going to make sure that you validate what you are doing so that you are not lead down the path of scams and unsupported product claims. Let’s face it there is a lot of money to be made in the business of spirituality. So begin to decipher as to when the skeptic has a valid voice and when the skeptic needs to move to the backseat and let go and let be. As for the image consultant what better way to take a deep look at your relationships and need for approval. If the people you surround yourself with don’t see you as your best self and inspire you to be your highest self then are they honestly loving you? If you seek the approval of others more than the approval of yourself why is that?",en,books

Otherwise it is a static string. Note: as of ICU 4.4, choice formats are not used, and the value returned in isChoiceFormat is always false.
IllegalArgumentException - if the nameStyle is not SYMBOL_NAME or LONG_NAME.
Returns the display name for the given currency in the given locale. For example, the SYMBOL_NAME for the USD currency object in the en_US locale is ""$"". The PLURAL_LONG_NAME for the USD currency object when the currency amount is plural is ""US dollars"", such as in ""3.00 US dollars""; while the PLURAL_LONG_NAME for the USD currency object when the currency amount is singular is ""US dollar"", such as in ""1.00 US dollar"".
IllegalArgumentException - if the nameStyle is not SYMBOL_NAME, LONG_NAME, or PLURAL_LONG_NAME.
Returns the display name for this currency in the default locale. If the resource data for the default locale contains no entry for this currency, then the ISO 4217 code is returned.

"Fruit and vegetables nutritional value has been gaining interest for consumers and it plays an important role for human health and diet. The nutritional value is generally represented by the accumulation of bioactive molecules that are in large part constituted by secondary metabolites and antioxidant compounds. The biosynthesis of these compounds mainly occurs thorough the phenylpropanoid pathway. The accumulation of bioactive compounds is highly dependent on the plant species considered, cultivar/genotype, agronomic management, and environmental conditions before harvest and during postharvest. The preservation of the nutritional value after harvest is influenced by storage conditions, packaging systems, and postharvest treatments.
Fruits and vegetables bioactive compounds content is very important for consumers, but it is also important for the produce preservation during the distribution chain as, for instance, produce with higher antioxidant compounds also have a longer shelf life. Among bioactive compounds, ascorbic acid, phenolic compounds, carotenoids, and glucosinolates represent the most important groups. The storage conditions and postharvest technologies can help to reduce the degradation or losses of bioactive compounds and even promote their accumulation. The physiological, biochemical and molecular changes can be correlated to the nutraceutical variations in pre- and postharvest stages. The plant hormones such as ethylene and abscisic acid possess a pivotal role in the regulation of fruit and leaf senescence of produce and directly influence their nutraceutical value. The regulation of the phenylpropanoids biosynthetic pathway can lead to the preservation or improvement of produce nutraceutical value.
Therefore, understanding how the accumulation of bioactive compounds can be enhanced or preserved is becoming crucial in crop and product quality. The availability of advanced molecular tools allows fast and accurate transcriptome profiling that can help in the identification of the main gene clusters that are activated or repressed under different conditions. Such data coupled with metabolomics information can provide useful information for production and postharvest management of produce with high nutritional value.
• New insights on biosynthesis and catabolism of bioactive molecules in fruit and vegetables and the relationship with growing conditions and abiotic stresses.
• The regulation of biosynthesis of bioactive compounds in fruit and/or vegetables during development and ripening: role of plant hormones and elicitors.
• New postharvest technologies or treatments able to promote or preserve bioactive compounds of produce.
• Potential role of molecular studies and genetic improvement for enhanced accumulation of bioactive compounds on fresh produce.",en,academic

"Mega Man Battle Network 3D, the long awaited fan-game, is shaping up nicely. A new video shows off Mega Man.EXE's updated model in action, bustin' viruses. The new model has a higher poly count and adheres closer to the source material's proportions.
That's not all, though! Team MMBN3D also announced the first playable demo coming later today. You'll find it at the project's official site here. Check back often!
It's certainly a definite improvement, but even as a artistically challenged individual, there are two major flaws with his new design.
1. His boots are still not proportionate. They're a bit too big in pretty much every aspect. Most official artwork show that the boots taper down to the same radius as the rest of his leg immediately below the flair at the top. The flair is also more pronounced than it needs to be, and it comes up too close to his knees.
2. His idle pose needs to be modified. I know they're trying to stay true to the in-game sprite, but the pose does not translate well into 3D if going for 1-to-1 accuracy. Sacrificing accuracy for looking better in a 3D environment is the way to go here, especially since we're going to be viewing him from different angles as he moves around, a problem the 2D sprite never had.
I critique because I see potential in the project and I like the series as a whole. I also understand that this is very much still a work in progress, which is why I'm happy that progress is indeed being made. The boots are probably the only real issue the model has now, honestly.
Lots of improvement, the attack animations are still a little bit too stiff but the new model looks great.",en,web

"Schools Get Taste of Own Medicine - WSJ.com: ""Schools long have graded students. Now they are being graded themselves, as a growing number of states assign them A-to-F scores to evaluate their performance. The results can be surprising. Eliot Elementary School in Tulsa, Okla., has been well-regarded by parents for years, in part for its high scores on state achievement exams. The school draws young families moving into the historic Brookside neighborhood that surrounds it. So parents and administrators were stunned when a new state report card last autumn gave Eliot a ""C"" on an A-to-F scale. Stephanie Coates, a mother of two Eliot students, called the ranking an ""unpleasant surprise"" and said she isn't convinced the state ""assessed what's going on with Eliot very well."" In the past two years, at least 10 states, from Arizona to North Carolina, began handing out letter grades to schools and, in some cases, districts. Modeled after an accountability program pioneered in Florida by then-Gov. Jeb Bush in the late 1990s, these systems gather reams of data, feed the numbers into complicated formulas and spit out letter grades. The formulas typically take into account test scores, graduation rates, attendance and progress among the lowest-achieving students.""",en,web

"PATNA: Actor-turned-politician Shatrughan Sinha, who just lately give up BJP and joined Congress, rushed to 10, Circular Road residence of former CM Rabri Devi along with his son Luv Sinha soon after attaining the town on Friday.
Shatrughan, the Congress nominee for Patna Sahib Lok Sabha seat, had earlier mentioned that he joined the Grand Old Party at the suggestion of RJD chief Lalu Prasad.
Through a chain of tweets, Shatrughan stated he met and greeted family members of “true buddy” Lalu Prasad. Shatrughan even posted two photos of his assembly with Lalu’s more youthful son and leader of opposition in state assembly Tejashwi Prasad Yadav on Twitter.
Sinha used to turn unity with the incarcerated RJD chief and his family even when he was in the BJP. He met Lalu on a few events at Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS) in Ranchi, where he (Lalu) is present process remedy. Shatrughan has additionally been a common customer at Rabri’s residence here.
Many had been surprised when Tejashwi and Sinha went for pandal-hopping in combination throughout Durga Puja closing 12 months. They additionally carried out ‘aarti’ in combination. Tejashwi too considers Sinha as a “mum or dad” and a “true family buddy” who stood with them even in unhealthy times.
Sinha, the BJP’s two-time Patna Sahib MP, had steadily been important of PM Narendra Modi and party president Amit Shah. After quitting the saffron party, he had described BJP as “one-man display, two-men army”. This time, Shatrughan is set to tackle Union law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad. Interestingly, both Shatrughan and Prasad are from upper caste Kayastha neighborhood, which has a sizable presence in Patna Sahib constituency.
Sources stated Shatrughan would get started his campaign in a few days. Prasad, then again, has been campaigning in the town for round a fortnight.",en,web
"In last week's post, I shared about the concept of emotional regulation. Regulating your emotions and keeping tabs on your ability to do so is an important part of your mental health strategy and self-care, not to mention your overall physical health.
Now, don't get me wrong. Expressing emotions is very healthy, whether those feelings are so-called ""positive"" or ""negative"" in nature. The expression of anger can be very good for your well-being, especially when that anger is justified. But when those emotions rule us, ruin our day, or otherwise have power over us, it's time for action in the interest of our greater well-being.
The power of emotional equanimity is the ability to self-regulate, know when it's time to get mad, when it's appropriate to be sad, or when you need a good cry. With an intact ego and emotions that are well-managed and under our control, we can be more productive, have healthier relationships, and communicate more effectively.
Like I said in my previous post, it's always our choice how we react in response to what others say or do, or to circumstances in our lives. While we may have a natural human urge towards attack, blame, or defensiveness, we can learn ways to short-circuit our knee-jerk emotional reactions and come up with new ways of dealing with conflict or bad feelings.
Keeping our stress at a relatively stable level can be a challenge, but being able to maintain our equanimity and not overreact can help us to navigate our relationships in a more manageable way, all while helping us to see our circumstances with more perspective.
Meanwhile, lower stress levels and lower emotional reactivity keeps our blood sugars lower and fewer stress chemicals circulating in our bloodstream, wreaking havoc, and causing unnecessary inflammation and physiological harm.
Like I said, anger and other emotions all have their place, and their expression can be healthy. But if there's a person in your life who is angry, upset, or otherwise unhappy most of the time, how is that person's health? How is their quality of life? Do you think that their level of stress and anger impacts their well-being?
Such people are like traffic signs to us; they people remind us that we have the choice to ""dial it down"" and move towards the center, towards emotional equanimity. ""Dialing it down"" doesn't mean turning off the emotions or burying them in our psyche. It means striving for the center, a place where we can lower our reactivity and increase our ability to respond without overreacting.
Emotional regulation can do wonders for your mental, physical, emotional and spiritual health. Think about your own level of emotional regulation, and consider the strategies or tools that can assist you in moving towards your own healthy center.",en,reference

"As I’ve shared before, I’m a big fan of oatmeal chocolate chip cookies (let’s be serious — they leave oatmeal raisin cookies in the dust!), so when a friend sent me a link to an oatmeal chocolate chip cookie recipe WITH PUMPKIN it was pretty much impossible to resist.
So yeah — pumpkin cookies? I’m down.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees and line a couple of baking sheets with Silpats (or parchment paper).
In a medium bowl, stir together the flour, golden flax meal, both kinds of oats, cinnamon, baking soda, and salt.
In a larger bowl, combine the butter and both sugars, blending until light and fluffy. Add in the pumpkin, egg, and vanilla, and blend until all ingredients are incorporated.
Add half of the dry ingredients and combine well, then repeat with the rest of the dry ingredients.
Form dough into rounded tablespoons and place them on the prepared baking sheets.
The result? A familiar treat infused with the taste of fall. I’ll take it. Now it just needs to stop being about 80 degrees and start feeling autumnal. Come on, North Carolina!",en,unknown
"Weight loss is a personal journey, so there are some things that just shouldn’t be said.
It’s important to support the efforts of someone trying to lose weight.
Suggesting a specific diet could actually be taken as an insult.
Suggesting that someone try a specific diet can be problematic because it encourages people to favor extreme weight loss solutions over tried-and-true healthy lifestyle alterations.
Asking a question like that can remind people of their past failures.
“Such pessimistic feedback can take all the wind out of someone’s sails and discourage them. It reminds them of past failures and negative experiences,” Leslie Heinberg, director of behavioral services for the Bariatric and Metabolic Institute, told US News.
People have the right to decide what they want to eat.
Not all body types of comfortable for all people.
You can ask the same question without pressing them for numbers.
This comment could make a dieter self-conscious about how they are eating.
This negative take on the question isn’t the best way to word it.
This might be a well-intentioned question. After all, you might not want to offer someone food that they’ll be obliged to turn down. However, by phrasing the inquiry as a negative, you’re forcing both of you to focus on a dieter’s restrictions.
This kind of comment can also make someone feel like they’re being perceived as a picky eater or a difficult dinner guest. Instead, try asking what kinds of meals that person has been enjoying lately rather than making them list the foods they’ve eliminated.
Over 50% of dieters say that they have been pressured to eat food on their diet.
You don’t know what is going to make someone feel better — even if it is “only” a few pounds.",en,reference
"The cause of Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) is not well understood. The current theories are that CRPS is caused by an injury or an abnormality of the peripheral and central nervous systems. CRPS generally occurs as the result of a physical injury or trauma such as infections, surgery and heart attacks.
There are two main types of CRPS. Type 1 is also known as Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy Syndrome (RSD). Type 1 CRPS develops after an injury or illness that does not directly damage the nerves in the affected limb.
Type 2 is also sometimes referred to as Causalgia. Type 2 and Type 1 CRPS have similar symptoms. The difference is that Type 2 CRPS follows a definite nerve injury.
Stiff joints and swelling and damage to the joints.
Swelling of the painful area.
Early treatment of CRPS is generally the most successful.
Medical providers use a wide range of medications to help treat CRPS, including: pain relievers, anti-depressants, anti-convulsants, corticoid steroids, bone loss prevention medications, and injections of nerve blocking medication. A variety of therapies can also help, including heat therapy, topical analgesics, physical therapy, TENS Units and biofeedback. In some cases spinal cord stimulation is also used.
Living with a chronic pain condition such as CRPS is very challenging. Continuing as many of your regular activities as possible is generally helpful. Therapy with a professional or a support group is also a good approach for many people.
CRPS is frequently present in an injured worker’s hands, arms, or legs. Generally, injuries to the hands, arms, or legs are treated as scheduled injuries with a specific limitation of how many weeks of permanent partial disability benefits a worker may recover.
However, an injury to a scheduled body part which includes CRPS is treated as an industrial disability injury. Therefore, the potential recovery for the injured worker is larger.
On March 7, 2018 the Iowa Workers’ Compensation Commissioner issued an Appeal Decision in the case of Luscombe v. IDA County Sheriff’s Dept. and Iowa Municipalities Workers’ Compensation Association which is a good example of how a CRPS case is analyzed under Iowa law.
The Claimant was a 44 year old high school graduate. The Claimant was hired by IDA County in June of 2006 as a 9-1-1 operator and as a jailor. The Claimant’s normal shift was from 6:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m.
On October 23, 2012 the Claimant was cleaning a jail cell when she struck her right hand above her little ring finger on a metal table attached to the wall. She reported the injury immediately. The injury was also recorded on a security video.
The emergency room assessment was that the Claimant had a bruise, pain and swelling to the back of her right hand. X-rays were negative for any fractures. The Claimant was advised to ice her hand and take anti-inflammatories for her injury.
Unfortunately, the Claimant’s hand injury did not resolve. The symptoms actually worsened and spread. The Claimant developed severe burning pain in her hand and arm that limited her ability to use her hand.
The Claimant was evaluated and treated by a large number of medical care providers.
By July of 2013 one of the doctors gave the opinion that he had no other treatment to offer and he did not see clinical signs of CRPS. Based on this opinion the Defendants took the position that the Claimant’s continuing hand problems were not related to the work incident and closed the case.
After this denial the Claimant moved forward to obtain medical care on her own and at the time of the workers’ compensation trial was being seen by John Cook, M.D. who is a specialist in pain management.
The Claimant was in pain, but continued to perform her regular duties without restrictions.
“The defendants provided a formidable defense. The diagnosis of CRPS is a complicated diagnosis and the defendants have solid treating experts, including most notably, Dr. Benedetti, who does not believe it is the correct diagnosis. The problem is that the evidence is quite convincing to me that there is something wrong with Ms. Luscombe’s right hand and arm. The defendants have not provided me with an alternative of what the problem is. It seems that as soon as the physicians decided that the correct diagnosis was not RSD/CRPS, there was no further attempt to diagnose the correct condition. The defendants simply denied the claim and moved on. It is unclear, for example, what Dr. Benedetti deemed the problem to be. Dr. Wampler stated that claimant ‘has a subjective pain syndrome that cannot be defined medically and should not warrant any additional treatment, investigation or restriction.’ (Def. Ex. L, p. 6) When read in conjunction with the remainder of his report, he seems to be suggesting that the pain is either in her head, not real, or somehow entirely unrelated to her work injury. I do not find that the greater weight of evidence supports such a conclusion.
The Workers’ Compensation Commissioner noted that three different doctors had all felt confident treating the Claimant using the diagnosis of CRPS. These were all treating physicians who were merely attempting to help the Claimant to prove her medical condition.
The Deputy Commissioner also noted that the Claimant had a strong expert opinion pursuant to her independent medical examination.
Both the Deputy Commissioner and the Commissioner found that the Claimant suffered from CRPS and that the CRPS was substantially caused, aggravated or lit up by her work injury. The Commissioner ordered that the Defendants pay the Claimant 100 weeks of permanent partial disability benefits.
The Defendants were also ordered to pay for all of the Claimant’s medical expenses after the Defendants closed the case, and all of the time that the Claimant missed work for attending these medical appointments.
The Defendants were also ordered to authorize and pay for the ongoing care of the Claimant by Dr. Cook.

"Once clinicians rule out organic conditions in the GI tract, such as ulcers or cancer, using endoscopy and other structural testing modalities, WMC testing is a valuable tool for diagnosing motility disorders, including gastroparesis and slow transit constipation, according to Dr. Kuo. He added that even if WMC testing shows no abnormalities, the clinician still can glean valuable information from the test. “If the test comes back normal, it allows us to move more confidently into the next area, checking for problems with nerve endings, such as visceral hypersensitivity, that could be driving the patient’s symptomatology,” Dr. Kuo said.
Wireless motility capsule ingestible capsule hardware.
Reproducibility is another advantage offered by WMC testing, according to Michael Cline, DO, a gastroenterologist at the Cleveland Clinic Twinsburg Family Health and Surgery Center in Twinsburg, Ohio. “If you conduct the WMC tests repeatedly, your results will be consistent,” Dr. Cline said. “We have documented that at our clinic with approximately 16 patients who have had to do 2 tests, and the numbers were within about 2 minutes of each other.” Dr. Cline uses WMC testing at the Cleveland Clinic in addition to his private practice. “There is nothing else that compares to it in terms of availability, and nothing that gives you that much information with one test,” he said.
Dr. Cline and his colleagues at the Cleveland Clinic retrospectively compared the results of WMC testing in 118 diabetic patients with those of 244 idiopathic patients, all of whom presented with upper GI symptoms and had prior documentation of delayed gastric emptying.9 The prevalence of generalized delay was similar at 36% and 30%, respectively. Also, diabetic patients were nearly 3 times as likely (42% vs 15%) to have isolated gastric delay as idiopathic patients.9 Dr. Cline and his colleagues hope to use WMC testing to characterize transit patterns in other diseases: He is currently collecting data on transit times in various connective tissue diseases, including Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, and lupus, to determine whether they have identifiable transit patterns through the GI tract. Please see the case study for a typical example of how WMC testing can influence patient diagnosis and treatment.

Mining or dam construction) or which cover a considerable area, ecological planning attempts to achieve integration between the project and the ecosystem. g. fuel, raw materials and the assimilation of waste). g. excessive weed growth in stored water) and maximize the life span of the benefits derived from the development. It will be clear that this holistic approach to development has economic as well as ecological advantages. Conservation Where regional development is to be undertaken it is reasonable to adopt a positive ecological approach.
Probably the ultimate factor behind the choice of location is the influence key personnel can bring to bear on the decision. Project success largely depends on people, especially those at the top. With limited options on the person and/or team to lead the project’s implementation, their location preference could be final. 1 Availability of water A water supply is an essential service for all manufacturing and process industries for domestic, cooling or process use. The significance of a water resource on the location of an industrial plant is essentially cost and security of supply.",en,academic

"Those who know Don call him a saint, but he just shrugs off such idle talk. For the year that ended this Veterans Day, Don could be found each Saturday morning at the foot of the memorial to a fallen soldier, next to Holy Ghost Church, in the shadow of 1999 Broadway. He took this protest action on because, in his words, which I can only faintly reconstruct, it felt like it had to be done. Most Saturdays during the year, only Don and his pet sheltie Juliet could be seen between 8 and 9 in the morning. Some mornings, a few of Don’s friends or his nephew would stand by him. Sometimes the dogs outnumbered the people.
If you know the memorial, it is one of those sad scenes depicting the reality of war, a soldier draped with a blanket lying prone atop a ten-foot pedestal. Those who stood with Don on many of those Saturdays also recognize this spot as one of the coldest in Denver. At first, he might’ve raised a few eyebrows from the security personnel at the shiny high-rise beast that envelops the church and memorial, but they soon ignored Don and his motley attendants, who could be seen shivering out in the cold. Instead, the homeless who would visit Holy Ghost Church for a cup of coffee paid attention to Don; he could always be hit up for a bit of change or a dollar.
Through the summer, Don and his cohorts imagined if the Democratic National Convention would pay attention to this protest, but it seems that the feds were much more interested in masked activists. Not a fellow who makes his voice heard in more private ways. Not a middle-aged slightly built man bundled up sitting on a campstool reading Thomas Merton. Not someone who will always give money to a person asking for a handout. Certainly not a person who had gathered at this same memorial some twenty years earlier in support of Vietnam veterans gathered for peace; he sometimes arranged food for their meetings, even though he had not served in that war. The DNC paid Don no attention. So, there never was publicity. Only the regular weekend drivers and riders of light rail might have noticed Don. But that was fine with Don – it still felt like it had to be done.

"Apartments in particular seeing steady supply as new year approaches.
Vietnam’s real estate market will continue to see stable development in the apartment segment with abundant supply in 2017, a conference in Hanoi on December 20 heard.
Mr. Nguyen Manh Ha, Deputy Chairman of the Vietnam National Real Estate Association (VNREA), told the “Prospects for the Real Estate Market in 2017 - Impact of Policy” conference that the country’s real estate market has seen steady development in apartments in 2016, with particularly strongly growth in high-end and luxury segment. “Stable development will continue in 2017, especially in the high-end and mid-end segments,” he said.
The luxury segment will not be as vibrant as in 2016 and the affordable segment will see more opportunities to grow but will be affected by government policy.
Mr. Tran Kim Chung, Deputy Director of the Central Institute for Economic Management under the Ministry of Planning and Investment, said that the structure of Vietnam’s real estate market will see movement from the mid-end and high-end to the affordable segment. “The market will focus on the actual living demand, so the market structure will move toward real needs,” he said.
In 2016 the policies of the government were advantageous for the real estate market. The State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) issued Circular No. 06, replacing Circular No. 36, aimed at tightening its regulations on asset-liability management and real estate loans. More policies promoted the development of the affordable segment, which is suitable for real demand.
Eleven new projects and the latest phase of one active project were launched in Ho Chi Minh City’s real estate market during the third quarter of 2016, supplying more than 4,600 units, for a significant decrease of 47 per cent quarter-on-quarter, according to the latest report from Savills Vietnam.
There were approximately 40,300 available units across all grades. Sales reached 7,500 units, increasing 7 per cent quarter-on-quarter and 43 per cent year-on-year. From the fourth quarter of 2016 to 2018, over 50,000 units are expected to enter the market.
In Hanoi’s real estate market, the total primary stock was 17,000 units in the third quarter, down 2 per cent quarter-on-quarter but 16 per cent higher year-on-year. Thirteen projects with fresh launches and ten newly-launched projects supplied 5,700 units, down 6 per cent quarter-on-quarter.
There were approximately 5,700 sales, down 6 per cent quarter-on-quarter and 15 per cent year-on-year. Over 13,000 units will enter the market in the fourth quarter of the year.",en,web

"Drawing portraits is an essential part of an artist’s development and education. Art Instructors use portraiture as the basis for practicing workflow, perspective, spacing, and the understanding of basic shapes. My fundamental growth as an artist occurred during my first two years in college when I drew from a live model 6 hours a day.
Portrait of a live model done by Liz in charcoal her Freshman year at The College for Creative Studies in Detroit.
Working as the lead artist at Alchemie, I’ve had to study business visuals to incorporate effective representations for the marketing and branding of the company. It can be a difficult task for an artist to put heart and soul into corporate artwork, but once complete, has proven to be quite a rewarding challenge and a valuable learning experience.
Our most recent presentation, a pitch for the Gates Foundation funded XR Education Challenge in LA, afforded me the opportunity to create new team illustrations, which utilized both my portraiture and corporate art experience. I had to balance overall look and feel of the presentation, which follows a minimalist and clean design, while doing my best not to offend anyone. A face is the mirror to the mind and many people perceive themselves differently than how someone on the outside may observe them. Caricature and portraiture artists have the same fear that what they note as distinguishable features may not match how the subject views themselves.
A slide from the alchemie presentation displaying the minimalist design.
Initially, I tried a simple pixelated look, with this method I used implied shapes to suggest an individual’s likeness rather than dive right into specific defining features. After comparing the results a pixelated portrait with the images from the presentation we decided the two styles conflicted.
Below is the first initial pixelate design, created in 3D, of our CTO, Joe. I was ambitious and wanted to tackle an isometric pixel portrait that would also be a gif.
Instead, I decided to combine the flat and minimalist teacher and student styles from early in the presentation with slightly more details and basic shapes to create our team’s portraits. This was a bit of a challenge (but also a lot of fun!) as I needed to add enough detail in the right places to show each individual’s likeness while not going overboard and throwing off the simplified design.
The final version of our Alchemie team shows off the personal style of each individual, while enhancing the flow of the overall presentation.",en,reference
"A command-line interface (CLI) is a text-based user interface (UI) used to interact with applications and operating systems. In this article, I am going to share with you 15 must-know CLI commands for every Linux user.
You might be new Linux user and you be finding it difficult to use while being in comfort of using GUI based operating system like Windows, and on another hand, you are curious to know new things and wanted to work with commands in Linux.
Before starting the list you must know there are lots of commands out there and you will come across all of them one day but the list below states the commonly used and important commands which every Linux user must know.
If you want to see the list of files on your Linux system, use the ls command. It shows the files /directories in your current directory.
The rm command removes files from the system without confirmation.
Directories can be created on a Linux operating system using the mkdir command. This command will create a subdirectory in your present working directory.
The cd command, which stands for “change directory”, is used to change the current directory. Use it to move around within the hierarchy of your file system.
This command prints the full pathname of the current working directory. To know which directory you are in, you can use the “pwd” command. It gives us the absolute path, which means the path that starts from the root.
The touch command is used to create a file. It can be anything, from an empty txt file to an empty zip file.
clear command clears the screen of terminal and get you back to current directory.
The cat command is used to perform three related functions with regard to text files displaying them, combining copies of them and creating new ones.
more is a filter for paging through text one screen at a time.
find can be used to find files and directories and perform subsequent operations on them. It supports searching by file, folder, name, creation date, modification date, owner and permissions.
apt-get is a shell command, which installs and maintains programs and other collections of files (data, documentation, etc.) in the form of packages.
wget stands for “web get”. It is a command-line utility which downloads files over a network.
wget is a free utility for non-interactive download of files from the Web. It supports HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP protocols, as well as retrieval through HTTP proxies.
It stands for “super user do!”, which allows a user with proper permissions to execute a command as another user, such as the superuser.
ifconfig stands for “interface configuration”. It is used to view and change the configuration of the network interfaces on your system.
man is used to learning more about a command or a particular tool and how to use it. It shows the manual pages of the command. If you need any help in understanding any of commands just add man command before it and you will get in manual i.e full information on command.
I believe ifconfig is in the process of being obsoleted by the ip command.
Thank you for your insight. We are very well aware of the fact that ip will eventually replace ifconfig, but the latter is something which will be around for some time and people are more aware of it. Hence, we wanted to share something that they find easy to use and remember. By the way, have another article underway which describes the ip command with proper usage.
Glad to here it helped you.
Hope you like our other articles too.
Thank you. Kindly share it in your social network as well.
Thank you for your feedback on our Article. Kindly share it in your network.

"We start by teaching phonics to the children as early as our Pre-School. This means that they learn how to ‘read’ the sounds in words and how those sounds can be written down. This is essential for reading, but it also helps children learn to spell well. Children learn ways of remembering these sounds and letters.
Teachers read to the children too, so they get to know all sorts of stories, poetry and information books, modelling intonation and expression as well as promoting a life long love of books. They learn many more words this way which then helps their writing.
Children’s reading books are assessed and levelled using Oxford Reading Tree Assessments, along with teacher knowledge of the child and the national Curriculum 2104 objectives.
All children from Year 2-6 also take part in comprehension and inference lessons where they are taught the wider skills of reading with the support of a teacher. They are given the opportunity to look at texts in more depth and practise a range of reading skills to support their development.
At Early Years and Key Stage One, their understanding of text is developed orally through open ended questioning. From Year 2 upwards, lessons become more formal, teaching children how to back up their thinking with evidence from the text.
HIGHER ORDER - Higher order questions make progressive cognitive demand on children. They encourage children to think beyond the literal. The effective use of higher order questions enables you to assess children’s understanding and thinking (inference).
Can your child find evidence directly from the story to answer your questions?
The answer is right there in the text.
Can you tell me what this word/bit means?

"Surgery for chronic pulmonary aspergillosis is often technically risky. The choice of immediate thoracoplasty or muscle flap plombage to prevent postoperative space problems remains controversial. This study focused on the use of muscle flaps to prevent postoperative complications.
During an 8-year period (2004 to 2012), all patients surgically treated for chronic pulmonary aspergillosis were enrolled in this retrospective study. Concomitant intrathoracic transposition of the latissimus dorsi muscle flap has been performed since 2011. The clinical records of these patients were reviewed retrospectively.
From 2004 to 2012, 16 patients were treated for chronic pulmonary aspergillosis. Fifteen patients received lobectomies and one had a partial resection. A preventive latissimus dorsi muscle flap was used in 6 patients (37 %). No postoperative deaths occurred. Prolonged air leaks appeared in 2 patients without muscle flaps, resulting in empyema in both. None of the patients with preventive muscle flaps suffered prolonged air leaks and subsequent empyema. In the outpatient clinic, late onset air leaks developed in 2 patients, one of whom had a lobectomy with muscle flap while the other had a lobectomy without muscle flap. Residual pleural space persisted in these two patients and Aspergillus infection later recurred.
Concomitant latissimus dorsi muscle flaps may be effective for the prevention of prolonged air leaks and subsequent empyema. Late onset air leaks are problematic.
Surgery for chronic pulmonary aspergillosis is often technically hazardous, resulting in a complicated postoperative outcome [1–3]. Chronic pulmonary aspergillosis may occur following a pulmonary insult such as tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, or pneumothorax [1, 2, 4]. The presence of hemoptysis is the most commonly used indicator of the need for surgery due to the risk of massive and fatal blood loss [1, 5]. Up to 30 % of patients with minor hemoptysis may subsequently have life-threatening hemoptysis [1, 2, 6]. Dense adhesion, pleural thickening, and incomplete re-expansion of residual lung parenchyma have resulted in mortality rates of up to 43 % and morbidity rates of up to 60 %, characterized by hemorrhage, residual pleural space, bronchopleural fistula, and empyema [1, 7]. The decline of tuberculosis has led to a dramatic reduction in both mortality and morbidity [1, 8–10], but surgical risk remains an issue in complex cases. Surgical treatment has been helpful not only in reducing symptoms but also in prolonging the survival of patients, including those who are asymptomatic [7, 8, 11]. The overall 10-year survival of surgically treated patients (84.8 %) is significantly better than the survival of medically treated patients (56.7 %), even in patients without symptoms (82.5 % vs 50.5 %) . Our institute recently introduced the use of a primary latissimus dorsi muscle flap to prevent prolonged air leaks that result in postoperative pyothorax. In cases with life-threatening hemoptysis, bronchial artery embolization was performed first as a temporizing measure, and non-emergency surgical treatment was planned. Here we report the results of a retrospective study on the surgical treatment of chronic pulmonary aspergillosis, with specific attention on the use of a preventive latissimus dorsi muscle flap.
During an 8-year period (2004 to 2012), all patients surgically treated for chronic pulmonary aspergillosis in our institution were enrolled in this retrospective study. The clinical records of these patients were reviewed retrospectively for clinical presentation, underlying disease, preoperative treatment such as anti-fungal therapy or bronchial artery embolization, indications for surgery, surgical procedures performed, postoperative mortality, complications, and long-term follow-up status. A diagnosis of chronic pulmonary aspergillosis was made on the basis of clinical symptoms, radiologic findings and serological examination, such as serum Aspergillus precipitating tests or serum beta-D glucan testing. Patients were classified as having simple or complex aspergilloma on the basis of medical imaging and operative findings: simple aspergilloma was defined as a thin-wall cavitation occurring in an otherwise healthy lung, while complex aspergilloma was found either in a thick-walled cavitation or in the presence of severe underlying parenchymal or pleural sequelae [5, 12]. Aspergillomas and Aspergillus organisms were histologically confirmed on all resected specimens.
We selected patients for surgery if they presented with aspergilloma or unstable symptoms after antifungal therapy with micafungin or voriconazole. Since 2008, bronchial artery embolization is performed first for patients with hemoptysis, and elective surgery is planned thereafter. Since 2011, concomitant intrathoracic transposition of the latissimus dorsi muscle flap has been performed, including one case with primary thoracoplasty. The Institutional Review Board of our institution approved this retrospective study of surgical treatment for chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (#25–39).
The Pearson chi-square test or Fisher exact test was used to compare categorical and dichotomous variables. Analysis of variance with life tables and Kaplan-Meier curves were used for the analyses of overall survival. Differences between two groups were analyzed using the log-rank test. Statistical significance was assumed to exist at two-tailed p values less than 0.05. All statistical analyses were performed using a statistical software package (JMP, version 11.0; SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).
From 2004 to 2012, of 62 patients diagnosed with chronic pulmonary aspergillosis, 16 were surgically treated for chronic pulmonary aspergillosis at our institution. The study group consisted of 14 male patients and 2 female patients with a mean age of 65 years (range 50–78). Patients with pulmonary aspergillosis had a variety of underlying lung diseases. Only 3 patients had no known underlying lung disease (Table 1). Tuberculosis was the most frequent underlying disease (56 %), followed by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (38 %) and pneumothorax (19 %). Comorbidities other than lung disease were found in all 16 patients. Diabetes mellitus was the most frequent comorbidity (63 %). Each patient had at least one of the following diseases: tuberculosis, COPD or diabetes mellitus. None of the patients had human immunodeficiency virus infection.
The mean Body Mass Index (BMI) of the group was 18.9 (range, 12.3 to 25.6). Six patients (38 %) were classified as underweight (BMI < 18.5) and 3 patients (19 %) were categorized as severely thin (BMI < 16.0). The mean Smoking Index was 31 pack-years (range, 10 to 100) among 12 smokers (75 %). The mean size of the fungus ball was measured as 3.4 cm (range, 1.5 to 6.1 cm). One patient (6 %) had simple aspergilloma and 15 patients (94 %) had complex aspergillomas. Lesions were located in the right upper lobe in 10 patients and in the left upper lobe in 6 patients. There were no statistically significant differences in patient characteristics between the group surgically treated with muscle flaps (n = 6) and without muscle flaps (n = 10, Table 1).
Seven patients (44 %) were free of symptoms, but demonstrated radiological lesions with fungus balls. Surgical treatment was chosen for the remaining 9 patients because of massive hemoptysis in 6 patients (38 %), minor hemoptysis in 2 patients (13 %) and pneumothorax in one patient (6 %). Previous antifungal therapy had been administered to 15 patients (94 %). The median interval from initial presentation to surgery was 8.2 months (range, 0.5 to 127.9 months).
Preoperative embolization was performed for 4 patients with massive hemoptysis, 2 patients with minor hemoptysis and 3 asymptomatic patients. It was successful for 5 of the 6 patients (83 %) with massive or minor hemoptysis. Embolization for the 3 asymptomatic patients was performed to reduce intraoperative blood loss. The median interval from preoperative embolization to surgery was 6.0 days (range, 1 to 21 days). Fifteen surgical procedures (94 %) were planned as elective surgeries; emergency surgery was performed for only one of the patients with pneumothorax.
Lobectomies were performed through posterolateral thoracotomies in 15 patients with complex aspergillomas, and partial resection through axilla thoracotomy in one patient with simple aspergilloma. After 2011, concomitant intrathoracic transposition of latissimus dorsi muscle flap was performed in 6 patients (38 %), including one patient with primary thoracoplasty resulting from a large residual pleural space. The mean operative time was 323 min (range, 93 to 625 min). Operative time was longer for patients with muscle flaps (mean 406 min, range, 315 to 625 min) than for patients without muscle flaps (mean 273 min, range, 93 to 392 min, p = 0.023, t-test, Table 3). Mean intraoperative blood loss was 725 mL (range, trace to 2225 mL). There was no statistical difference between patients with muscle flaps (mean 1017 mL, range, 381 to 2225 mL) and those without muscle flaps (mean 550 mL, range, trace to 1500 mL, p = 0.140, t-test, Table 3). There was no statistical difference between patients with preoperative embolization (mean 903 mL, range, 180 to 2225 mL) and those without preoperative embolization (mean 497 mL, range, trace to 1500 mL, p = 0.192, t-test).
Intraoperative spillage occurred in two patients (Cases 4 and 5 in Table 2). Massive irrigation was performed (6 L and 10 L, respectively) and postoperative antifungal therapy was continued. One patient suffered late onset air leak and recurrent aspergillus infection 22 months following surgery. The other remained free from recurrence 25 months after surgery.
No postoperative deaths occurred within 30 days. While the postoperative courses of 12 patients (75 %) were uneventful, postoperative nonfatal complications occurred in 4 patients (25 %) (Table 2). Prolonged air leaks developed in 2 patients who had either a lobectomy without the muscle flap or underwent partial resection, resulting in empyema in both. Open window thoracostomy was performed on one patient, and thoracoplasty on the other patient. None of the patients with the preventive latissimus dorsi muscle flap suffered prolonged air leaks and subsequent empyema. While two patients required home oxygen therapy at discharge, all patients were discharged to their homes. No occurrences of postoperative excessive bleeding or bronchial fistula were found. Length of stay in the intensive care unit was 2 days for most patients. One patient did not stay in the intensive care unit, and one patient stayed 3 days. The mean length of hospitalization after surgery was 22 days (range: 7 to 72 days). There was no statistically significant difference in postoperative complications between the two patient groups surgically treated with or without a muscle flap (Table 3).
In the outpatient clinic, late onset air leaks were found in 2 patients who had received lobectomies, with and without a muscle flap. Two and three months after the surgery, intrathoracic fluid levels decreased with no aspiration pneumonia on chest radiographs. Although no further surgical intervention was required and the patients were clinically stable, residual pleural space persisted and Aspergillus infection recurred 8 and 15 months later. One patient declined 24 months after the surgery; the other is alive and well 92 months after the surgery. Two patients suffered pneumonia and were readmitted, and one of them declined 5 weeks after the surgery. The remaining five patients died from malignant disease (n = 2), gastric perforation (n = 1), and unknown causes (n = 2). The 3-year overall survival following surgery was 63 %. There was no significant difference in the 3-year overall survival rates between patients with a muscle flap (31 %) and patients without a muscle flap (79 %, p = 0.242, log-rank test, Fig. 1).
We selected patients with chronic aspergillosis for surgery when they presented with aspergilloma or unstable conditions such as hemoptysis after antifungal therapy. For patients with hemoptysis, bronchial artery embolization is performed first and elective surgery is planned thereafter. For patients with complex aspergilloma, who were supposed to have tight adhesions, potential risk for incomplete re-expansions and postoperative persistent air leakage, concomitant intrathoracic transposition of the latissimus dorsi muscle flap was considered. Since full posterolateral thoracotomies were usually performed because of tight adhesion or invasion of a cavitary lesion into the chest wall, the latissimus dorsi was often cut and not available for potential use in a second surgery [3, 11]. While Daly et al.  have recommended sparing the latissimus dorsi muscle for potential use, such an approach can hinder the operative field of the first surgery . Harvesting the latissimus dorsi muscle flap at the full posterolateral thoracotomy, instead of cutting or sparing it, and covering the bronchial stump and the cutting surface of the residual lung parenchyma was performed to prevent prolonged air leakage and consequent empyema, although we could not demonstrate the benefit statistically because of the small sample size. Patients with muscle flaps required longer operative time and experienced slightly more blood loss than patients without muscle flaps, but the differences should reflect the difficulty of the surgery. The procedure of harvesting and transposition of the latissimus dorsi muscle flap usually requires approximately 30 min without significant blood loss.
Incomplete reexpansions after lung resections are frequent and responsible for severe complications following surgery for chronic pulmonary aspergillosis . Pleural space problems can manifest as prolonged air leaks, residual pleural pocket, and Aspergillus empyema . Before introduction of the latissimus dorsi muscle flap, 2 patients developed prolonged air leaks, which progressed into empyema requiring thoracoplasty in one patient and open window thoracostomy in the other. Prevention of prolonged air leaks is essential for the deterrence of postoperative empyema.
The use of immediate thoracoplasty versus muscle flap plombage to prevent postoperative space problems is still an issue of debate. Massard et al.  prefer to use thoracoplasty as a second choice procedure to avoid unnecessary mutilation of some patients. They use the preventive immediate thoracoplasty reported by Personne et al. in up to 25 % of their cases . Akbari et al.  and Kim et al.  do not employ primary thoracoplasty or latissimus dorsi muscle flaps. Park and Jheon , Endo et al. [14, 15] and Babatashi et al.  perform concomitant thoracoplasty in some cases to prevent space problems, and the possible development of empyema, if a large volume of dead space is encountered. Chen et al.  use additional surgical procedures such as pleural tenting and partial thoracoplasty to avoid prolonged air leaks or residual space, sometimes clamping the phrenic nerve to induce temporary paralysis in patients with good lung function. Farid et al.  have reported that persistent space problems might be addressed with a pectoralis flap, modest thoracoplasty, or both, and that the use of a muscle flap reduces the extent of a thoracoplasty, which is helpful for later functioning of the chest.
The late effect of the muscle flap is another concern. Farid et al.  explained that initially the muscle flap will often nearly fill the cavity and then atrophy, leaving considerable space. Chest x-rays showed findings of a small finger of muscle, which were believed to be sufficient to keep Aspergillus from recolonising the cavity . In our series, although the muscle flap was effective for preventing postoperative persistent air leakage in all cases, one case developed late onset air leakage resulting in persistent space and recurrence of Aspergillus infection. Late onset air leakage has also occurred among patients without a preventive muscle flap and resulted in recurrence of Aspergillus infection, probably accompanied by pleural aspergillosis. Late onset air leakage and subsequent persistent pleural space would be a possible risk for recurrent Aspergillus infections.
While recurrent hemoptysis or Aspergillus infection following surgery is reportedly rare [5, 8, 9, 19], Farid et al.  found that 8 out of 30 patients (26 %) experienced disease recurrence (Table 4). Although the difference is not obvious, Farid et al.  discussed how their postoperative follow-up protocol was formulated to enable early detection of recurrent disease, but concluded that recurrence is problematic. In our institute, 2 of 16 patients (13 %) with late onset persistent air leakage and subsequent pleural space have developed recurrent Aspergillus infection. One patient declined 24 months after surgery.
Regarding the extent of resection, anatomical lobectomy might be suitable for inflammatory disease, if the residual lung function permits. Chen et al.  preferred complete lobectomy to avoid possible complications and recurrence, with only 2 of 256 cases of postoperative fungal relapse: one patient after a wedge resection by video-assisted thoracic surgery and another after a lobectomy combined with a segmentectomy. Although it is desirable to limit resection as much as possible, to prevent a decrease in lung function , a radical resection of affected areas most effectively improves patient outcome  and minimizes the risk of postoperative prolonged air leakage. Although division of interlobar fissures using electrocautery has been used to reduce the residual lung volume caused by stapling , the potential risk for prolonged air leakage should be considered in cases with incomplete reexpansion of the residual lung.
Preoperative bronchial artery embolization for hemoptysis was successful in 5 out of 6 patients (83 %) in our series, allowing immediate cessation of life threatening hemoptysis. Non-emergency surgical treatment was then planned to proceed within two weeks. This modality has been used as a temporizing measure and not with permanent intent [5, 9, 10, 13, 18]. While the control of bleeding has been achieved in more than 90 % of cases , recurrent fatal hemoptysis has been reported in the weeks following embolization  or 30-50 % in 3 years . Long delays before surgery are not recommended .
Farid et al.  reported pre-operative percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy feeding as another method of preoperative stabilization. Major surgical procedures require sufficient nutritional and performance status . The survival of patients with preoperative weight loss exceeding 10 % of their usual body weight was significantly diminished, with a 5-year actuarial survival rate of only 30 % .
This study had several limitations. First, it was a retrospective analysis covering an 8-year period. Second, we could not confirm any statistically significant differences because of the small number of patients. However, we believe this study may provide some useful information for the surgical management of patients with chronic pulmonary aspergillosis.
In conclusion, concomitant latissimus dorsi muscle flaps may be effective for prevention of prolonged air leaks and subsequent empyema, while late onset air leakage resulting in residual pleural space and recurrent Aspergillus infection were problematic. Surgical management remains the mainstay of treatment for aspergilloma. With preoperative stabilization using bronchial arterial embolization, early surgical intervention on a non-emergency basis is recommended.

"A couple who recently opened a HoneyBaked Ham and Caf� in Jacksonville are also looking at New Bern as a possible site for one of the franchises.
Jackie Barton, who worked for the Beasley Broadcast Group for 16 years before retiring, and her husband Michael, who is a retired Marine master gunnery sergeant, opened the Jacksonville franchise recently at its permanent location in Cross Point Shopping Center off of Western Boulevard.
They opened temporarily in the shopping center just before Christmas and 1,000 people visited the first week, Barton said.
Barton said the HoneyBaked Ham Corp. is now considering locating a store in New Bern or Morehead City.
The study is being done to see if the area market can support the store in New Bern, Barton said.
Since opening the store in Jacksonville with the 25-seat cafe, Barton said the response has been huge.
But since they keep selling so well along with sandwiches, soups and salads, Barton said it was a good indicator that people in the area would build a strong market for HoneyBaked Ham.
�We�ve already had a huge response for (ham and turkey) reservations for the Super Bowl,� she said.
The Jacksonville store has 25 full-time and part-time employees and has an outreach program for local communities, Barton said.
The store supports the Onslow Ministries and would also support charities in New Bern if one is located here, Barton said.
The HoneyBaked Ham Company is a privately-held, family-operated business with more than 260 company-owned and 184 franchise locations nationwide.

"Alexandra Handal is an artist who lives and works between London and Jerusalem. Born into a Palestinian family in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, Handal had a transnational upbringing. She has lived in a number of cities, among them: New York City, Paris, Boston and Berlin.
Handal’s short film, From the Bed & Breakfast Notebooks (2008) was selected for the prestigious New Contemporaries 2009 internationally juried exhibition which showcases emerging artists in the UK. It culminated in an exhibition at A Foundation, London (2009) and Cornerhouse, Manchester (2009). Her short film was described as a ‘quietly powerful political engagement’ in Studio International magazine (2009) and she was listed among the ‘few names to watch’ in the Guardian (2009).
Handal has shown her work in group exhibitions internationally, at the Rencontres Internationales Documentary Programme, Paris/Berlin/Madrid (2009 & 2010), Al-Hoash Gallery, Jerusalem (2009), Art Dubai (2009) DePaul University Museum (2005), and DUMBO Art Center, NY (2002). She had her first solo exhibition Alexandra Handal, Recent Work at the International Center of Bethlehem, Al-Kahf Gallery, Bethlehem, Palestine (2004).
Handal is currently completing a combined practice/theory PhD in Fine Art at Chelsea College of Art and Design, London. She is the recipient of the University of the Arts London Research Studentship Award (2004) and the Chelsea College of Art and Design Graduate Fund (2007 & 2009). She was a participant at the Royal Geographical Society with IBG, Annual International Conference (2009) and has been invited to present a paper for the upcoming Oral History Society Annual Conference in association with the Victoria Albert Museum (2010). She will be discussing the role of oral history in the making of her web-based artwork, Dream Homes property consultants that will be launched in 2011.
Handal obtained an MA in Studio Art at New York University (2001), a BFA in Painting and Minor in Art History at Boston University, Boston, MA (1997); and pursued parallel studies in Paris and Madrid. The year after she completed her undergraduate degree, Handal was selected for The 4th International Exhibition of Women’s Art at SOHO20 Gallery in NYC – a show that was juried by curator Leslie Jones from the Museum of Modern Art, NY (1998). She was an artist-in-residence at the School of Visual Arts NY (1999) and at Altos de Chavon in La Romana, Dominican Republic (2003). Handal was a Finalist for the Young Artist of the Year, Hassan Hourani Award from the A.M. Qattan Foundation, Ramallah, Palestine (2004).
Alexandra Handal is currently conducting research for her next short film, Sketches from the City of Whisperers to be exhibited at the Liverpool Biennial (2010).

"Olan Stubbs is director of Campus Outreach Birmingham, Alabama, at Briarwood Presbyterian Church. He is a husband and father of four. He writes more at his ministry blog.
My wife and I fought a lot early in our marriage. My wife became increasingly emotional and hypersensitive. I became increasingly cold and insensitive. We had a shouting match almost every day about something.
Typically I could catch myself and turn my emotions off. I would wait for my wife to say something that was slightly irrational in my opinion, and I would pounce like a lion. She would usually just walk away in anger.
And so we rode the downward spiral.
For the first time, I saw a glimpse of just how Pharisaical I had been as a husband. I had not washed my bride with the water of God’s word. Rather, I had viciously attacked her in her weakness, using his word like a swift sword of justice. I also had downplayed my sin and excused my weaknesses.
Something finally clicked that night.
When Jesus teaches us how to love each other, he tells us to focus first on the sin in our own lives before moving too quick to help others with theirs. He says, “First take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother’s eye” (Matthew 7:5). Even if we think our spouse is 99% wrong, and we are only 1% wrong, we first should turn our energy and effort on our own sin — the sin closest to us, the sin we are responsibile for.
If my wife and I both had a speck of dust in our eyes, the speck in my eye would look larger because it is closer to me. Ignoring our own sin to focus someone else’s is like having a 2x4 stuck under your eyelid. We compare our sin to others, thinking they are wicked, while we aren’t so bad.
I’ve made many promises in my life, and broken too many of them. But God helped me keep this one. My wife and I would get into an argument. As soon as I caught myself, I would shut my mouth and listen. I didn’t attack her. I would focus on receiving and embracing her correction.
It was hard. Often I was boiling inside. But when the conversation ended, I would go pray. I would start out complaining, telling God how he needed to change her. But eventually I would confess my own sin to him. Over time, I started to soften, break, and be humbled by how much God was constantly forgiving me. The radical mercy of Christ, flowing from the cross to me, began to change me as a husband.
It took more than a year, with counseling, to work through our baggage. But the tenor of our marriage changed over those months. For the first year or so, we had been in a race to defend ourselves and attack each other. We wanted to score the most points by landing the best rebuke. We wanted to win the argument.
Now, for the last fifteen years or so, we typically race to see who can repent first. Rather than rushing to the other person’s specks, we try to focus on our planks first. In the process, we have become more humble, because we are more conscious of our own brokenness and need for grace. We have become more gracious, because we are so much more aware of how much Christ is constantly forgiving us. We have become much more gentle, because we realize how tender it can be to get sin out of our own eye.
God saved my marriage not by fixing my wife’s problems, but by helping me see my own and showing me mercy where I am wrong. After years of apologizing, extending grace, and learning, we now are far more likely to repent and forgive than to fight and scratch.",en,books

Absolutely gorgeous, these family friendly chairs were stunning against a taupe gray wall with teal silk drapes. Came quickly, well protected and just what we needed.
This is the coolest chair I have ever purchased! It brightens up my living room so well! The colors match the greens, blues and the magenta in my room, matches perfectly!!
These beautiful upholster chairs added the pop to my living room that I was looking for. The colors are vibrant and they are so comfortable.
I have never before purchased furniture on-line, but after lots of searching at my local furniture stores and not finding anything I liked, I turned to online. I am so happy that I did! I am re-doing all of the rooms in my home and I have found everything I need/want here. I bought two of these chairs for my up-dated cottage-style living room. They are gorgeous and I really love them. They were carefully packed and arrived in perfect condition - and a week earlier than originally scheduled. They are so easy to set up...all I had to do was take them out of the box, screw in the legs and they were ready to go. And even though these chairs are on the lighter side, they are very sturdy and very well made. The bolts on the legs are extra long so the legs are very securely attached and do not wobble at all. Also, I would say that the colors in the upholstery are accurately represented on the computer monitor. I'm just really in love with these chairs. I can't wait for my other purchases to arrive!",en,web

"Abstract: Emotional experiences have aroused HCI researchers’ interest once these types of experience involve many parts of our body, such as muscles, body postures, and psychophysiological measures. Hedonic experiences give us pleasure and good emotions, and this paper focuses on it. Some psychophysiological measures have already been correlated with both valence and arousal, the main dimensions of emotion. However, a consensus has not been reached on which psychophysiological measure better represents the emotion’s dimensions. In this paper, three combined non-invasive psychophysiological measures were used to verify which of them represents the emotion’s dimensions. Besides that, an approach to studying the tendency of user’s emotion is presented, assisting HCI researchers in HCI experiments. An experiment was conducted using quantitative and qualitative data analysis, and the results show important correlations that were used in the proposed approach.",en,academic

The Stipendiary Stewards reported that they had questioned Trainer Altamaash A.Ahmed and Jockey Neeraj Rawal in the above connection. Trainer Altamaash A.Ahmed said that the instructions to Jockey Neeraj Rawal were given by the Owner i.e. he was given a free hand to ride his own race, however, at the time of mounting the horse in the paddock, he told Jockey Neeraj Rawal not to go to the front, let the horse enter the straight with a lead and then to pick him up and do his best. When asked about his observation of the race, Trainer Altamaash A.Ahmed said that Jockey Neeraj Rawal is a top Jockey in the country and has won many Group races, however, in this race he had all the opportunity to take the gap on the inside in the straight which he failed to do. He said that at the top of the straight Jockey Neeraj Rawal has first gone in and then come out and travelled behind ARTICULATE (A.Sandesh) and then further come out to make his running despite there being ample room to come from the inside at that stage. In view of this, he was very dissatisfied with his riding.
The video recording of Race No.192 was viewed. Pointing to the video recording, Trainer Altamaash A.Ahmed substantiated his statement that at the top of the straight Jockey Neeraj Rawal has first gone in and then come out and travelled behind ARTICULATE and then further pulled him out and made his run despite there being sufficient room to come from the inside.
Jockey Neeraj Rawal requested that he would like to see the race once again from the 1000 metres.
The video recording of the race (from 1000 metres) was viewed. Pointing to the video recording, Jockey Neeraj Rawal explained that approaching the 600 metres he initially wanted to make his move from the outside of ARTICULATE, however, Jockey P.S.Chouhan (NOTTING HILL) moved alongside him whereby he had no room and as such he had to sit behind ARTICULATE, thereby he was pocketed. Further, ARITICULATE being a decent horse, he thought that he would lead him till the 400 metres, hence he continued to tail ARTICULATE . He said at that stage, since he was pocketed and running very close on the haunches of ARTICULATE, his main thought process was to avoid clipping the front horse and he did not realize during the race that a gap had emerged on the inside and only realized the same after he was called by the Stipendiary Stewards and saw the replay. He added that approaching the 400 metres he wanted to come from the inside, however, seeing Jockey A.Sandesh (ARTICULATE) sitting motionless, he thought that ARTICULATE may shift in and he would get tightened and hence he waited behind ARTICULATE and NOTTING HILL (P.S.Chouhan) was alongside on his outside and he felt that NOTTING HILL would fizzle out but unfortunately he did not.
The video recording of the race was viewed again and it was pointed out to Jockey Neeraj Rawal that even accepting that before negotiating the bend, passing the 600 metres, he was sitting behind ARTICULATE as he wanted him to lead him into the straight, however, after coming into the straight, from the 400 metres onwards till going past the 300 metres, there was a huge gap opened up on his inside and how could he miss that big gap. Jockey Neeraj Rawal said that he was on the heels of ARTICULATE and his mind was preoccupied to make his move from the outside and in the process he did not notice the gap on the inside. He admitted that what was being pointed out to him now was right and if he had made his move from the inside, he would have won the race. He said that normally when riding Mr.Shyam M.Ruia’s horses, he waits and then makes his move but in this case he was specifically asked to make his move coming into the straight and hence he was very keen to make his move and in the process he did not realize the gap opening on the inside.
Having considered the submissions made by Trainer Altamaash A.Ahmed and Jockey Neeraj Rawal and having viewed the video recording of the race, it is evident that there was a big gap opened up on the inside from the 400 metres till passing the 300 metres which Jockey Neeraj Rawal failed to take and instead made his move from the outside and Jockey Neeraj Rawal admitted that if he had taken the gap he would have won the race. Although there was no drift in the odds, however, the Stipendiary were not satisfied with the explanation tendered by Jockey Neeraj Rawal and reported him to the Stewards for unsatisfactory riding.
that he had admitted his mistake and also that there was no drift in the odds, the Stewards decided to suspend his Jockey’s license for only 3 Race Days i.e. if he applies for a Jockey’s license for the Season 2019/20, the same will be granted to him, however, his license shall stand suspended for 3 Race Days starting from the first race day of the Pune Meeting 2019 (permitted to ride work/mock race).
The Stipendiary Stewards reported that they had questioned Trainer H.J.Antia and Apprentice H.Zeeshan in the above connection. Trainer H.J.Antia said that he gave similar instructions in both the races i.e. to take a good jump and go to the front or sit 2nd/3rd and to do the best. He said that in Race No.170 the field was strong and the winner clocked a good timing of 1 Minute 24.760 seconds as compared to 1 Min. 25.524 clocked by DECCAN KING in Race No.187. Also, his horse received a bad check soon after the start and thereafter he did not improve since he is a front running horse. Subsequently, he used Blinkers on the horse in Race No.187 which has helped the horse. He said that the horse was not fancied both the times and he was at long odds.
Apprentice H.Zeeshan who rode DECCAN KING in Race No.170, confirmed the instructions and added that soon after the start the horse drifted outwards and he immediately corrected the horse and brought him in, however, at that stage the horses on the inside shifted out, due to which he received bad interference and dropped back. He said that it is evident on the video recording that after the interference he has pushed the horse and caught up with the field but he was not able to get a good position. Thereafter, coming into the straight the horse responded to the first two cracks of the whip but on the third crack he started leaning inwards, hence he collected the reins and rode him out, however the horse did not respond and kept dropping back. He said that after the race, he had advised the Trainer to use Blinkers on him next time out.
The video recording of Race No.170 was viewed and it was pointed out to App.H.Zeeshan that he was lacking in his efforts to hit the front or sit in a good position as instructed. App.H.Zeeshan reiterated that after the start the horse drifted outwards and he immediately corrected the horse and brought him in, however, at that stage the horses on the inside shifted out due to which he received bad interference and dropped back. Thereafter, he pushed the horse and caught up with the field was not able to get a good position.
Having considered the submissions made by Trainer H.J.Antia and Apprentice H.Zeeshan and having viewed the video recording of both the races, the Stipendiary Stewards were not satisfied with the explanation tendered by Trainer H.J.Antia. In that, although the horse did receive interference at the start in Race No.170 and he was at long odds in both the races, however, the horse had shown marked improvement vis-à-vis the common horse NAVIGATOR in 18 days time (In Race No.170 NAVIGATOR had finished about 4 ¼ lengths ahead of DECCAN KING and in Race No.187 DECCAN KING beat NAVIGATOR by more than 10 lengths). Therefore, they decided to fine Trainer H.J.Antia a sum of Rs.20,000/-.
Further, the Stipendiary Stewards were not entirely satisfied with the explanation tendered by Apprentice H.Zeeshan, especially with regard to the positioning of the horse in the early part of the race and severely reprimanded him for the future.
The Stewards of the Club at their meeting held on 14th March, 2019, had considered the Stipendiary Stewards Note dated 6th March, 2019 Re : Enquiry into the comparative performance of UNTITLED (Hanumant Singh) in Race No.161 run on 21st February, 2019 which the gelding won as compared to his previous starts, especially in Race No.74 where Jockey Hanumant Singh was suspended for 2 Race Days for injudicious riding and Trainer H.J.Antia was fined Rs.10,000/- for tacit approval.
It was noted that by declaring a better Jockey (S.Zervan) on SLAM DUNK in Race No.161, Trainer H.J.Antia diverted the attention from the eventual winner, UNTITLED, with a Jockey of a lower caliber (Hanumant Singh), who had been punished for his riding in Race No.74 on the same horse and it was felt that the said race was a build up to this race which the horse won with substantial betting. Under the circumstances, the Stewards of the Club had permitted the Stipendiary Stewards to re-open the enquiry into the running and riding of UNTITLED in Race No.74 run on 30th December, 2018.
Subsequently, vide office letters dated 18th March, 2019, both Trainer H.J.Antia and Jockey Hanumant Singh were asked to show cause in writing latest by 24th March, 2019 as to why further action should not be initiated against them in connection with the running and riding of UNTITLED in Race No.74.
b) To change the charge on Trainer H.J.Antia from tacit approval to unsatisfactory running of his charge UNTITLED in Race No.74 and to fine him Rs.20,000/-. Since, Trainer H.J.Antia has already been fined Rs.10,000/- earlier, hence to impose on him an additional fine of Rs.10,000/-.

"For the vast majority of homeowners, maintaining a beautiful home is a source of immense pride. Figuring out exactly what steps to take to keep your house looking great without spending all of your free time and extra money on maintenance, though, can be a bit of a challenge. As you read this guide, you will find some useful information about the essential things you need to do to make sure your home’s exterior looks great all year long.
Make sure shrubs and trees are trimmed.
Overgrown shrubs and trees can instantly make an otherwise well-kept home look shabby and poorly maintained. If you’re going to have foliage on your property, make a point of maintaining it properly by having it regularly trimmed and sculpted. Generally, homeowners who don’t have much experience with landscaping hire professionals to prune their plants. This is a good choice as it ensures the job is done correctly and no plants are actually damaged.
Keep your eyes peeled for water damage.
Over time, a variety of exterior materials, including wood, asphalt shingles, paint, and caulking, can be affected by water damage. While you can’t do anything about precipitation, you can make sure any sprinklers you have in your lawn aren’t inadvertently aimed directly at your house.
Furthermore, correct any water damage as soon as you notice it. Repainting, recaulking, and even replacing rotten wood are all relatively simple tasks that will go a long way toward making the exterior of your home look great. It’s also important to have a professional make sure the damage hasn’t impacted your home structurally in any way.
Have your siding cleaned annually.
Siding is designed to withstand the elements, but it still takes a beating over the course of a year, especially in parts of the Carolinas that frequently experience bad weather. To keep your home looking its best, it is a good idea to have your siding pressure-washed by a professional once per year. This will remove any dirt and debris that have accumulated, leaving it looking brand new!

Replace or repair cracked paths and steps.
Walkways and exterior steps made of natural stone or concrete tend to crack over time. This may take many years, but if your house is older, you may be dealing with this issue. Having broken stone all over your yard is an eyesore, so the best option is to have the walkways or steps in question replaced. This project typically isn’t as expensive as homeowners are expecting it to be and it does wonders for curb appeal.

"Before I left again for Ireland, we took some picture in the famous Japanese restaurant Zushi. We thought it could be the best location to show you these fantastic Prada pilot sunglasses. Well, we were definitely right!
Probably, those among you who like to watch the catwalk events have recognized them. Yes! These new shades are the ones that the models wore during the Prada F/W 2013/14 runway show.
I think it’s unnecessary to say that they are simply incredible and that I love them! Most of all because of the new light that they can give to the simple outfit that I’m wearing. They are indeed an amazing touch that makes it unique! So, let me say that, when you are wearing a pair of sunglasses and this happens, it means that you’ve chosen the right one!",en,web

"This study was undertaken just as the UK Government increased its commitment to the adaptation agenda – at the same time as public-sector funding cuts reduced the scope and scale of climate change activities at the local level. The findings are relevant for all bodies operating at this level whose climate change adaptation activities affect vulnerable communities. The study provides insight into how social justice can be incorporated into adaptation planning.
Socially just adaptation is a complex concept and will take time to become embedded in policy and practice. As a continuous process, climate change adaptation is not as straightforward to plan or deliver as mitigation.
Socially just adaptation responses require, first, an understanding of which groups are most vulnerable to climate change impacts and, second, adaptation to ensure the needs of these groups are met. Social issues related to adaptation are both diverse and contextually specific.
While national and local policy and practice are beginning to recognise the importance of embedding social justice in adaptation, this is not being realised across the board. Public sector funding cuts have reduced the priority of, and resources for, local climate change responses.
Social vulnerability to climate change tends to be interpreted in terms of spatial exposure or health rather than broader factors affecting people's ability to prepare for, respond to and recover from extreme weather. Local authority adaptation plans focus mainly on building adaptive capacity rather than delivering direct adaptation actions.
There are some excellent examples of just adaptation across the UK but more needs to be done to ensure this is more widely adopted. Information sharing is crucial to promote good practice.
Opportunities to support just adaptation include new mechanisms and funding streams, such as Local Nature Partnerships, neighbourhood planning, the transfer of health responsibilities to local authorities and the Community Infrastructure Levy.
The National Adaptation Programme due to be published in 2013 provides an opportunity for government to set out its expectations.",en,academic

"This is because when the sugar is taken out, something else goes in otherwise the product in question will taste like cr*p. And the thing that goes in is always a lab-produced sweetener that's about as good for you as drinking bleach. That's before you get to the chemicals and processing required to get the sugar out in the first place. So, should you be using sugar free sports drinks and other low/no sugar products as part of a performance diet?
While it's true that a bucketload of sugar is not good for us, some is no bad thing, and its demonising in the mainstream media has had a deeply unfortunate knock-on effect on the food and products lining our supermarket shelves from cereal to sports nutrition.
Because - in what can be glibly passed off as a fine upstanding piece of corporate responsibility - food manufacturers everywhere have rushed to remove sugar from their products and save lives the world over. Aww, bless their little cotton socks.
Yet instead of grabbing this golden opportunity to light a shiny new path to a healthier population, the dunces behind these new products have instead snatched defeat from the jaws of victory by replacing the sugar with cheaper, nastier and significantly less healthy sweeteners. Ingredients connected to diabetes, cardiovascular disease, dementia, arthritis and more.
And they have saved a ton of cash in the process.
First by swerving new government taxes on soft drinks like the UK's sugar tax, and secondly by slashing ingredient costs.
After all, sugar, as a natural product, is subject to nature's whims as harvests go up and down affecting supply and ultimately cost price, while the artificial sweeteners replacing the sugar are cheaper to start with and, being made in a lab, their prices don't fluctuate half as much, if at all.
All of which means that while food manufacturers look like angels and governments look tough on health, consumers instead get stitched up with worse products made even more cheaply.

"It all started in 2013 when two best friends decided they had had enough of everyday protein bars full of dubious ingredients. They decided to shake the protein bar industry a bit and, boy, did they shake it. Aside from the efficient packaging and the exception ingredients of these protein bars, the introduction of the RXBAR discount code has made this brand more successful than ever! This article, however, is not dedicated to the brand’s success story or the RXBAR nutrition facts. We are here to provide you with an informative guide concerning all the ways you can save when shopping these delicious protein bars!
Getting a discount code at this store is usually quite simple. You can either visit RXBAR’s website and see what promotion is currently on or sign up for their newsletter to receive exclusive offers, promo codes, and important information about their products.
One of our team members decided to join the RXBAR community, and the first email he received contained an RXBAR 25% off discount code. Any discount code is usually applied automatically, but sometimes you’ll have to type it in during the checkout process.
Among other sales and offers, you can easily find an RXBAR printable coupon online. This coupon is valid in any of their brick-and-mortar stores, and you’ll probably receive it as a welcome gift when you sign up for their newsletter.
Another recurring offer is the RXBAR sample pack discount. People from RXBAR know that the taste of their protein bars is their greatest advantage and they try to utilize it to the fullest.
Coupons are truly a magnificent way to make great savings; they’re not the only way you can get terrific products at bargain prices. Read on and learn more about coupon code alternatives at RXBAR.
At the moment, there’s no RXBAR free sample offer. However, if you subscribe to get a sample pack every 30, 45 or 60 days, you’ll earn yourself a 5% discount on all those orders. Furthermore, you can change the number of units, modify the delivery frequency or skip the next delivery if you feel the need to do so.
Even though people are all about finding RXBAR coupon codes, 2018 has been marked with RXBAR’s sitewide sale. Throughout this sitewide sale duration, RXBAR offered 15% off on all products as well as free shipping. This offer was nearly an equivalent of a 20% off coupon. While this sale ended on January 22, 2018, we think that another treat of the sort will surely become available again.
If you’re wondering about the cost of a trial pack, $6 won’t be enough to buy it. Even though there are kids’ packs and peanut butter/blueberry packs for adults that cost around $6, the full-grown RXBAR trial pack costs $12 now and contains six protein bars in six different flavors.
The RXBAR best flavor choice consists of chocolate sea salt, peanut butter, blueberry, chocolate chip, mixed berry, and peanut butter chocolate. Moreover, there are five different protein bar packs, and if you want to try them all, make sure you look through the website for coupons and subscribe to the RXBAR newsletter. Signing up and getting a family whole30 coupon can save you more than $15 and shipping fees.
Free shipping is often available in combination with RXBAR discount codes. However, when there aren’t any codes available on the website, and there’s a shortage of email offers, remember that free shipping is available for all orders over $40. So far, shipping is available only in the US, while shipping to Canada will soon be available as well.
New customers are always appreciated at RXBAR. Spreading the word about the best protein bars is the first thing people usually do after consuming them. So, make sure you tell your friends to buy one as well. Send them a referral link, and both of you will save $5 each on an RXBAR healthy snack. It’s like getting a discount code every time you guide a friend towards better protein bars and grant them a $5 RXBAR discount code.
If you’re not satisfied with your purchase or have received damaged merchandise, RXBAR urges you to send an email to [email protected] Their customer service team will either replace the product you’ve bought or issue a refund.
However, you must return the product within 30 days from the delivery date. Furthermore, the package must have no more than three bars missing when you return it. Finally, note that return and exchange fees are paid by the buyer and that your RXBAR coupon won’t be refunded.
Aside from contacting RXBAR via email, you can reach them at 312-624-8200. Their working hours are Monday to Friday from 9 am to 5 pm (CT). You can also fill in a contact form on their website stating your inquiries, offers, etc.
You can purchase RXBARs directly from their website or in one of many Crossfit gyms, stores, coffee shops, juice bars and other well-equipped retailer shops all over the country. You need to use RXBAR’s store locator to find out places that sell RXBARs near you.
Creating an authentic product isn’t easy – it takes a lot of hard work and dedication. Furthermore, delivering a high-quality product to customers and keep them coming back is even harder. RXBAR have proven that, although hard, these two missions are not impossible. By introducing the RXBAR discount code, this brand has achieved exceptional success when it comes to promoting a high-quality product.",en,web

"Looking for a Vermont resort with pool?
Pool? Yes! At long last… it’s summer at Sterling Ridge Log Cabins in Vermont! There were times during this last winter when we doubted we’d ever see those lazy of summer again, too—but the sun is out, and we are, too!
There is something so wonderfully carefree about the warmer weather; something so rejuvenating about leaving the house (or, even better, the log cabin!) without boots and hats and layers upon layers of clothing; something beautifully childlike about the joy that summer brings.
The snows of winter helped to feed the Lamoille River this spring. Canoe or kayak down the Lamoille at your leisure-take in the sights; pause for an old fashioned picnic along its banks, or plunge into the cool waters. Vermont Canoe and Kayak offers many options, and we have paddleboards, too! Check out the Sterling Ridge Resort and Log Cabins Stay and Paddle package. It’s like having your cake and eating it, too!
Nothing appeals to the kid in us as much as a swimming pool on a hot summer day. A Vermont resort with a pool? Yes! We’ve got that covered, too! Whether for a quick dip, an afternoon of non-stop paddling (and the occasional cannonball), or just lounging with a book pool-side, our pool is ready and waiting!
Not every activity revolves around water at Sterling Ridge Resort. For landlubbers and animal-lovers craving a fun-in-the-sun activity, might we suggest horseback riding? Horseback riding in the Green Mountain foothills is another memorable way to take in the breathtaking scenery of the meadows, woods, and mountains.

"Using an 18-month process, the City of Manassas will update its Comprehensive Plan–the City’s key policy document for land use, development, preservation and related economic and social issues. As part of that update, the City will also develop its first Transportation Master Plan to guide future transportation investments and improve mobility in the City. This is an exciting time for City residents as the Manassas community envisions its future!
Citizen input in updating the Comprehensive Plan is vital to a more livable Manassas. Throughout the summer and fall, the City will host a second round of Community Conversations on key topic areas, like land use and transportation. These conversations began on June 19th with a visioning session on land use. Additional meetings are scheduled throughout the summer and fall. City Staff will also be available to meet with neighborhood and community organizations to gather feedback. Please contact 703-257-8223 for more information about hosting a meeting.
Tuesday, June 19th– 7 PM @ Boys and Girls Club, 9501 Dean Park Ln.
Please visit www.manassascity.org/planmanassas for additional information and additional meeting dates.
As part of the ongoing Comprehensive Plan update, the Prince William County Planning Office has created several small area plans to guide development in key areas of the county. Each small area plan may offer opportunities for improved transit, increased open space, and greater walkability.
Public outreach will be accomplished through one or more public meetings and design charrettes for each project. A charrette is a collaborative planning session among a project’s various stakeholders – in this case, government officials, consultants and/or developers, and interested members of the public. A planning outline and some anticipated outcomes are provided for each active plan at the links below. There are no upcoming public hearings or charrettes currently scheduled, but the Planning Department promises to update the website when they have been. We will monitor the website as well.
The basis for this project is two studies completed earlier this year: one by the Dale City Sustainable Design Assessment Team (SDAT) and the other under a Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments (MWCOG) Transportation/Land-Use Connections (TLC) Program grant. The scope of the studies includes redevelopment of both the Dale Boulevard/Minnieville Road intersection and Mapledale Plaza at the intersection of Dale Boulevard and Queensdale Drive, as well as extensive redesign of vehicular, cycling, and walking infrastructure throughout the area.
An examination of the Innovation Park area and a couple of miles of Prince William Parkway between Sudley Manor Drive and Godwin Drive/Nokesville Road, with the goal of developing Innovation Park as an economic center for PWC.
Covers US-1 between Occoquan River and Occoquan Road, north to I-95 and south to Belmont Bay Wildlife Refuge. The major issues appear to be the US-1/VA-123 interchange and multi-modal transportation options. There is currently very little usable infrastructure for non-motorized traffic in this area.
An update of the existing Parkway Employment Center sector plan at I-95/Horner Road/Prince William Parkway. A .pdf of the 2008 sector plan is available here.
There is not a lot of information available for this plan yet. It will include a bike path along US-29 between US-15 and Somerset Crossing.
Future SAP projects include Independent Hill, Triangle, Yorkshire, and Fairgrounds/New Dominion.
Ryan Foster (rfoster@pwcgov.org), Community Development Manager, and David McGettigan (dmcgettigan@pwcgov.org), Long-Range Planning Manager, are the primary points of contact for questions or comments.
Active Prince William is a group of concerned citizens who advocate for improving opportunities, support, and infrastructure for active transportation and healthy lifestyles within Prince William County, Manassas, and Manassas Park. We are interested in helping to make Prince William County and Greater Manassas a more livable and sustainable Community.
The City of Manassas is holding a series of “Community Conversations” to gather ideas, priorities, and visions for the community’s future from individuals, families, neighbors, business professionals, and community leaders. This is your opportunity to shape Manassas by sharing your perspectives and providing input on key topics such as quality of life, services, transportation, land use, and economic development.
This community engagement process follows up on the City’s 2014 and 2016 community surveys, in which the following 10 community priorities were identified in order of importance.
You can also engage with City staff at the farmers markets in downtown Manassas on September 16 and 28 and October 21 and 26.
In addition, you can participate online through the City’s new online engagement portal!
The Community Conversations will dig deeper into the “why” of the top priorities to find location-specific issues and gauge if any priorities are missing from the list generated by the survey. The findings from both the survey and the Community Conversations will assist the City in updating its strategic priorities and comprehensive plan. Join the conversation!
The City of Manassas is in the planning stages of a redesign of Grant Avenue, a road considered the southern gateway to downtown Manassas. Citing pedestrian safety and safe routes to schools, City staff are considering a road diet from 4 to 3 lanes with improved pedestrian sidewalks and crossings. A public meeting was held on 29 June with additional public engagement in the planning process to come in the future. Implementation of the Grant Ave Streetscape Project will also enable the city to move forward with smart growth re-development on the southern side of the city.
At the public meeting on 29 June, there was considerable staff, consultant, and community support for implementing a four-lane to three-lane road diet to improve walking and bicycling conditions, enhance bus stops, and increase aesthetics without significantly degrading motoring. Mayor Parrish, three current City Council members, and senior City staff were present at the meeting.
At the meeting, staff guided interested individuals in using the Streetmix computer program to design alternative cross sections for Grant Ave. While conventional bike lanes are eminently feasible and should be adequate for many bike riders with a road diet’s traffic-calming influence and a lowered 25 MPH speed limit, it was clear that the current street right of way is constrained, and expanding the sidewalk areas to include planting strips with street trees, urban street lamps, and bus shelters is an important “competing” priority that may preclude adding buffered or separated bicycle lanes.

While a simple road diet can often be accomplished using only maintenance funds to repave and re-paint the new lane configuration, expanding the sidewalks and planting strips, undergrounding the currently overhead utilities, and adding bus shelters, urban street lights, street furniture, trees, and other landscaping along Grant Ave will necessitate considerable construction funds.
The Initial planning and design for the project has been funded, but there’s not yet any funding allocated for construction, and thanks to HB 2 and HB 599, which target road capacity expansions, neither the Virginia Commonwealth Transportation Board (CTB) nor the Northern Virginia Transportation Authority (NVTA) are likely to provide any money for a road diet. If construction will be locally funded, it’s unlikely that the curbs will be moved, so as to greatly reduce construction costs. At the meeting, Active Prince William advocated for alternatives–including buffered bike lanes–that could fit within the existing roadway.

"Home Review Shall we consider a three-tier government for a moment?
Shall we consider a three-tier government for a moment?
Raila at this year’s Devolution Conference held in Kakamega county.
At this year’s Devolution Conference, Raila Odinga urged the country to consider introducing a third tier to the government structure. Two things came to mind: Raila is a good governance junkie and this proposal was not a surprise to those who know him well. Secondly, it is meant to test the waters and ignite debate that will lead to changes in the devolution law.
Raila’s obsession with constitutional changes as a basis for good governance makes him appear as a one tool artisan. His astute political skills serve this obsession well, making him a warrior of good governance.
The objectives of devooution, which are also its spirit, are to promote democratic exercise of power, foster national unity, recognise communities’ right to manage their own affairs, give powers of self-governance to the people and enhance people’s participation in county governance, to decentralise state organs and ensure equitable distribution of resources in Kenya. The spirit behind the letter of the law is well worded but Kenyans have summarised it to “let us all ‘eat’”.
Devolution was born out of the majimbo (federalism) debate that was part of the push for changing the constitution in the nineties. The idea was to go back to the government structure that was proposed at independence and advocated by KADU.
In the 90s, the civil society, realising the futlity of trying to dislodge Moi, determined to water down the presidency by giving power to regional governments.
In an article by Robert Maxon featured in ‘Kenya at 50’, titled ‘The Demise and Rise of Majimbo in Independent Kenya’, he explains how the centrists pushed away federalism from our laws. While the independence constitution introduced in 1963 had some significant characteristics of federalism, the regionalism created fell short of a full federal system of governance. Within a year of independence, the regional system was rendered redundant through constitutional changes. At the inauguration of the republic on December 12, 1964, majimbo had disappeared as KADU folded and joined KANU. That is how federalism disappeared from our political vocabulary until its return in the 90s.
At independence, the “small tribes coalition” around KADU then led by Ronald Ngala and Daniel Moi, was born out of the fear they would be dominated by the Luo and Kikuyu. Federalism, with 8 regional presidents, was thus a way of safeguarding their interests against the big tribes who were pushing for a centralised government.
In the 90s, the tribalism ghost came back again but this time it was Kikuyus in the fear zone. The government of Jomo Kenyatta had settled Kikuyus outside Central Province, especially in the Rift Valley Province, where the Kalenjin had formed a habit of throwing them out of their farms.
In the run-up to the first multiparty elections in 1992, tribal clashes instigated by the Kalenjin had displaced many Kikuyus from Nakuru and Eldoret. If the eight regions were to be retained then, Kikuyus would be at the mercy of KAMATUSA (Kalenjin, Maasai, Turkana and Samburu), the larger conglomerate of Rift Valley tribes. The Kikuyus in the opposition like Mwai Kibaki, Martha Karua, as well as their sidekicks like Kiraitu Murungi, pushed for constitutional change but skirted around majimbo. Raila became the most devout defender of federalism.
The first legal framework for review the Constitution was designed in The Constitution of Kenya Review Act – CKR Act, which came into effect on May 13, 2001. The CKRC Draft Constitution, commonly known as Ghai Draft, was ready by 2002 but Moi dissolved Parliament prematurely in October before it considered it, ahead of the 2002 General Election in December.
When Moi handed over power to NARC leader Mwai Kibaki in 2003, a cabal of new generation of Mt Kenya Mafia put constitutional change on ice. Kiraitu Murungi, then minister for Constitutional Affairs, had the audacity to say the push had only had the objective of removing Moi from power, which had happened.
In 2005, the Bomas Draft was ready but the PNU side of NARC led by Mwai Kibaki sent Attorney General Amos Wako to Kilifi to re-draft it. The Bomas draft had provision for 14 regional units, and a power sharing formula between a President and Prime Minister.
The Kilifi Draft retained an all-powerful president and Raila Odinga and his LDP brigade in NARC campaigned against it in the November 2005 Referendum. In the end 58% of Kenyans voted against it, and the change-the-constitution push was shelved as politicians went for 2007 elections.
The 2007 elections became a blessing in disguise for the clamour for constitutional change. Mwai Kibaki was controversially sworn it at night and the next day Kenya began burning. The post-election violence forced Kenyans to take constitutional changes seriously, an effort that culminated in the promulgation in 2010.
Before the political class agreed to the draft, the basis of which was the Bomas Draft, PNU managed to water it down to a pure presidential system based on the American Constitution. Federalism was watered down to Devolution and the units increased to 47 Counties.
Raila gave in by giving up on parliamentary system so as to appease the fear of Kikuyus but also win on Devolution. His hope was that devolution would transform the lives of Kenyans. The reality, eight years later, is very different. This is why he is pushing for another round of reforms.
Raila meant to give power to the people but the truth is politicians wanted a piece of the national cake. The Kikuyu and Kalenjin elite under Kenyatta and Moi had amassed a lot of wealth. This prompted the political outsiders to come up with a formula for distributing the cake to the grassroots. Everybody wanted a piece of corruption, and that was the true spirit behind devolution. Luo politicians have not bothered to conceal this fact, as some have said openly that Raila brought them devolution so that they can also eat.
It is now evident that as much as there are success and promising stories from devolution, many counties have not moved from teething problems and are not sustainable. Some do not even make economic sense and the leaders appear lost in the details of governance.
Meanwhile, no county collects as much revenue as did the municipal and county councils in the former dispensation.
Raila’s proposal for a third arm of government, and referred people questioning him to the Bomas Draft, is an indication that he wants to push for a reduction in devolved units.
His fear is that the new political class in counties will not receive it well. People have been preparing to vie for Governor and other posts and they will not give in without a fight. So he is taking the long route because he believes a majority of people will support him once it finds its way into the referendum. The trump card is to cater for the fear the Kikuyu have about Rift Valley.
Most of these counties were hived out after independence with the latest coming in the early nineties. Vihiga was part of Kakamega until 1992 and there is no reason they cannot merge. Kisii can merge with Nyamira, Homa Bay with Migori, and Kisumu with Siaya; the latter is largely a rural county and merging it with Kisumu would give it an urban and industrial edge, just like Kericho will do to Bomet.
The former Eastern province can give us Lower Eastern – Makueni, Kitui and Machakos. As well, Eastern can have Meru, Tharaka-Nithi and Embu while Isiolo and Marsabit can form Upper Eastern.",en,books

When I was learning to show Bearded Irises I had the best teacher Helen Reid, a lovely lady that is very well know to many Iris fanciers around Australia and has been the treasurer of the Victorian Region Iris Society for many years. I was taught well by an expert. I won two big flower shows soon after, back in 2000 or 2001. One of the shows was a country show and nearly every lady, including some men from the surrounding districts. Lots of people in the Riverina area entered a flower or many spring flowers from their gardens. They got so many exhibits because anyone could enter their produce on the day. Two large halls full of flowers near bursting out the doors were staged as well as floral art and many home made garden art items. Sadly this doesn’t happen anymore, the young ones don’t seem to be interested or they move away to the cities for work.
To win the best flower in a country show back then was an absolute honour, and would never happen again in a lifetime. I was very lucky to win the best flower in that country show once. Read on to see how and why I won Ist Prize.
This particular morning in spring, it was early Iris season for the talls, when most country shows are held in Australia. I went out to my Iris garden about 18 years ago and saw this lovely iris flowering, a very early variety out of my 400 varieties that I grew and supplied back then. I couldn’t believe my eyes it had 4 gorgeous new flowers out on one stem, this Iris flower had flared falls and the first flowers flowering from the flower socket as well. Back then flared falls was a new type of Iris flower especially to get one to flower so early. The Bearded Iris flowers that were bred and in gardens had always, big downward drooping flowers some narrower than others but was rare to have an iris with flared falls flowering so early in the season. It was a new release and new fashion to the Iris world just like when the horns and spoons were introduced to irises years later. I new I had a good chance of winning the best Iris in its class with this amount of first flowers out at once. If only I could get the stem to the show in one piece without any damage. So I picked it and packed it and I drove 47km to the Walbundrie show, to enter the iris. After I entered the Iris in the show I had to go straight home. I couldn’t wait around till after lunch time to find out the results because I had 2 very young autistic children to look after. I was told that night that I had won the best flower in the whole show and not just the Iris section. Yay I was so excited I couldn’t believe it!
The second time I won the best flower in the show, was at the Inland Region Iris society in Yarrawonga Victoria not long after and never found the time to show Irises since. I still have both of these two winning Iris flowers growing in my garden to this day and more time to show them now.
Here are the two Tall bearded Iris that I have won ”Best Iris In Show”. They are definitely show winners.

"LED Downlights in Perth - Why Purchase Now?
If you wander into your regional Do It Yourself superstore as well as go to the lighting area you will certainly find that screens of LED downlights are coming to be more noticeable. One of the most common are direct substitutes for GU10 keys voltage halogen downlights (exact same dimension & shape as well as you do not have to change your light fittings). Nevertheless one take a look at the price and also the assured response is EXPENSIVE!!!.
A halogen bulb costs around a ₤ 1.00 contrasted to about ₤ 18 for a 4 or 5 watt LED. Eighteen times the price.
Nevertheless, LED's use less power, last longer as well as do not generate as much heat.
A normal LED Downlights in Perth is rated at 25,000 hrs whereas a keys voltage halogen bulb benefits 1,000 hrs. So purchasing one LED light is equivalent to getting 25 halogen light bulbs. A web saving of ₤ 7.
As far as power intake is worried about LED' eat a tenth of the power of halogens. If you presume that electricity costs 10p a kilowatt hr a 5 watt LED eats ₤ 12.50 during its lifetime. Compare this to 50-watt halogens which will certainly cost ₤ 125 to run. An internet saving of ₤ 112.50.
The third consideration is heat. Halogens fume so you can not cover after that in insulation without throwing down the gauntlet (increased fire risk, melted wires, light bulbs often popping). If you mount them according to the producer's guidelines halogens require a gap in the insulation around each downlight. This sort of beats the suggestion of insulation and also means that halogens are excellent at heating up your loft room when they are on and cooling off your space when they are off.
LED's don't fume so you can insulate and save on your home heating costs.
So do you replace your halogens with LED's or otherwise? The only negative aspect is initial price however if you take a longer-term view each LED conserves you over ₤ 100 during its lifetime.
As with all new technological technologies rates start high yet decrease as sales boost. You can wait till LED rates come down or you could be proactive. Just get one and also try it. You will conserve loan, you are decreasing your carbon footprint as well as you are helping to enhance those sales volumes which will certainly bring rates down.",en,web
"Paper Darts Micro Fiction Award.
At an artists' residency that took place in the shell of an old elementary school, I was placed in a haunted room. A plumber came to investigate the moaning sounds. On my last night, when there was a riot of knocking down the hall, the residency head barged into my room with a shotgun and sage.

Q: Where is your favorite place to read? To buy books?
This is a bit of a sad-sack answer, but I can't really read when I'm not in bed—because of chronic illness, being upright quickly exhausts me, and so it makes the most sense for me to read in bed. That said, I really love both of my beds; I have one in my office and one, obviously, in our bedroom. And my favorite place to buy books is Green Apple Books on the Park in San Francisco. They were so supportive of me and my debut novel, and the space is full of light and space.
Any one of the self-help books that I own, probably. Women, Food, and God by Geneen Roth is the first one that comes to mind.
Thyroid medication. I have hypothyroidism, among other medical issues, so I wake up, take a pill, and wait for twenty minutes (the minimum amount of time that must pass before I eat or drink) before getting out of bed.

"A common theme I see in my office is difficulty with discipline. Parents come in overwhelmed by certain behaviors and feel that no matter what they do, what they say, or what punishment they give – nothing seems to help. Let’s face it, hearing screams coming from the back of the house, siblings fighting, temper tantrums, kids not doing school work, and getting calls from school can be frustrating. All you want is to get them to stop and make better decisions. How can we do this in a less painful and frustrating way? I would like to offer an alternative framework for discipline that encourages your child to learn and grow.
Traditionally, discipline is thought of as punishment and consequences; in order to get a child to stop a behavior they must be punished and shown there are consequences for their actions. This form of punishment is fear driven. While this may be effective in the short term, it most likely will not change the behavior or teach them anything in the long term. Unhealthy discipline involves yelling, screaming and everyone leaving angry and elevated. Instead of viewing discipline as punishment, we want to reframe the situation as a teaching opportunity. We want to help our kids make better decisions and improve how they handle themselves in the future. In order to stop the bad behavior, we need to nurture our child’s developing brain by teaching them how to handle emotions and situations appropriately.
The first thing to do before you discipline is to simply pause. Ask yourself: Why did my child act this way? What lesson do I want to teach? How can I best teach this lesson? We can use the example of a child throwing a controller at their sibling after losing a video game. Why might they have acted this way? Did they have a hard day at school? Are they getting overwhelmed by anger and frustration? Is trying to keep up with their older sibling a theme? Was cheating involved? There is a host of reasons this action may have occurred and we have to keep that mind. What do we want to teach in this moment? Do we want to teach how to appropriately manage anger, respect property, express our emotions properly, better handle the situation?
Second, how can we best teach these lessons? This might look like connecting empathetically with their anger and frustration: “it’s really hard playing video games with older brother, I would be really frustrated and angry too if I kept losing,” “sometimes when I get angry, I just want to throw something too.” Once we have connected and empathize with the child’s emotion, we can take the next step. Maybe we include them in on the discipline: “what do you think we can do differently next time we feel really angry like this?” or “what do you think we can do to make this right?” This creates a dialog and a teaching opportunity to facilitate the understanding of themselves, what may have caused the situation, their emotions, and helps them make better choices in the future.
For more in-depth information on disciplining from this framework I would highly suggest reading No-Drama Discipline by Dan Siegel and Tina Bryson.

"The Argentina area of the Atacama offers some unique landscapes not found with its Chilean and Bolivian siblings. For example, the Desert Labyrinth is a massive area of red clay mountains formed and shaped by the elements while the Campo de Piedra Pómez is many many miles of stunning pumice rock sculptures. But I think my favourite place here is the Cono de Arita, perhaps one of the most otherworldly volcanoes I've yet seen.
The Puna de Atacama is at an elevation of 3,600 metres. We come straight here from the town of Salta and stay at this elevation for most of our time. Participants may find themselves slightly breathless and it's important to slow down and take things easier. Carrying lighter / smaller cameras and smaller bags is advisable.
With limited infrastructure, the roads are very bumpy and long. The Puna region of Argentina is one of the poorest areas in South America and although every effort has been made to make your stay as comfortable, it can be demanding on your comfort levels. If you like an adventure, wish to see some of the most amazing landscapes you'll ever see, and are happy to slum it a little, then this trip is for you.
As soon as we leave the main city of Salta, there is no wifi or mobile coverage for the duration of the trip. We are in a very remote region.
This trip has been given a Moderate to occasional Strenuous Grading even though all locations are close to the vehicle. This is because some of the vantage points require a 10 minute walk up steep inclines at high altitude. Also, because of the high altitude and less oxygen - you will find that the simplest of walks is more demanding than normal.",en,reference
"I just want to try to convince you here, to make your own Hummus. It’s fresher, lighter and you control what goes in it. Not to mention you get more of it, for the money. There’s no “natural flavors”, whatever those could be, and it’s not dripping with oil, because we really don’t neeeeed those empty fat calories.
I am addicted to Hummus! The problem is, trying to find a store bought hummus that is not filled with those things I mentioned above. This recipe won’t be that exciting for many of you and I totally understand, but for my friends who might not have stopped to think about how easy it is to whip up your own fat free hummus, this one is for you!
There are so many possibilities and all different kinds of flavors. Just leave out the roasted peppers and play with it. And depending on what you are going to dip… chips, veggies, pita bread, gluten free pretzels (which we love, along with sliced cucumber) or crackers, you can adjust the seasoning to compliment it best. For instance, you probably don’t want to over salt the Hummus if you are going to eat it with something salted. But you might want to add some extra spice and sea salt if you are going to eat it with plain veggies.
Without the oil, there is a lighter feel to the Hummus, you may have to spice it more to compensate until you get used to it. But did you see my post about the dangers of oils? We certainly don’t need the extra oil. I am now making my own Hummus and it tastes so good! It might take some getting used to if you are only familiar with store brands. Our taste buds can get so manipulated that we have to stop and reset them back to “natural”. It takes a little time.
Although everyone who tries my Hummus, likes it a lot. I am a picky person, a tough critic of my own creations. I was right up until the other day, looking for that unique ingredient that will really push this dip above and beyond. I was thinking that it may be I want to try adding another roasted pepper to really go bold? Or add some of my dad’s canned peppers from the garden? But what I stumbled upon was the addition of Vinegar. Yep. Vinegar. It gives it that zesty zing that makes this dip awesome.
When you make your own Hummus, just know that the flavors really come out as it sets, chills and thickens up (in case you added too much liquid) in the fridge. Just have fun and adjust the seasonings to suit you. Try adding different herbs and spices. Add lemon zest and cayenne pepper. Just don’t be afraid to make your own… your way! It’s so much healthier, especially when you soak and cook your own chickpeas. I haven’t gone that far yet. But I imagine I will one of these days. The canned chickpeas I found at my local Meijer store, are organic and contain only 100 mg of sodium per serving. Not great, but certainly better than most canned beans out there. These just make the cut off being 110 calories per serving. It is wise to make sure that any packaged products in a healthy diet contain no more sodium than it’s calories. Tough to do! So being in a hurry most days with our schedule, canned chickpeas it ends up to be.
I like the idea of adding roasted red pepper because red peppers have such a good dose of Vitamin C. Higher than an orange… 3 times more, actually. I understand that by lightly roasting the pepper, some Vitamin C may get destroyed. It’s still good. And I’m still gonna roast ’em!!
Note* The ingredients above can be adjusted to your liking. First clean the pepper and remove seeds. Cut in half and place on a baking sheet and roast lightly. Do not brush the pepper with oil. I like to put mine in the toaster oven at 350 degrees for about 25 minutes while I do a quick workout in my living room. Why not?
Next place all the ingredients except the spices and about half of the liquid from one can of the chickpeas into your Vitamix blender or high speed blender. If you don’t have a Vitamix, but you think your blender can handle it, go for it. I am pretty sure that this can be made in a food processor as well. Save the other half of the liquid from the chickpeas and use it to thin out the Hummus as you blend only if needed. Blend for 1 minute and use the tamper (with a Vitamix) to press the ingredients into the blades. Blend until creamy consistency.
Season the Hummus with the spices and lemon zest and plenty of sea salt. Place the dip into the refrigerator to chill and set for at least an hour.
First, I just threw my son a birthday party. He turned 4! I can’t even believe how time flies. I really wanted it to be a party for me though. A celebration that mommy made it this far with my sanity still in tact! Had I remembered how much work a party is, I may have just packed us up and went on a fun trip (for the price) instead! Mommy didn’t get to do much celebrating, she was hard at work in the kitchen! Do you know how hard it is to find a healthy gourmet caterer in the burbs of Chicago let alone anyone prepping vegan dishes? There’s a niche there just waiting to be discovered. I don’t think it’s for me though.
I wanted my guests to enjoy great food that is healthy and kind all at the same time. So if you want anything done right, sometimes you have to do it yourself. I made it happen! Everyone loved the food. Kids included. They also had a blast with the batman theme and bounce house. When the party wound down, who do you think was in that bounce house getting her money’s worth and bounce on? That’s right. Mommy. That was a fun stress relief that I highly recommend. I am thinking some fitness classes need to be catered to grown-ups while in a bounce house. That could be fun!?!
I would love to show you more pics of the party and food. Visit me at my Karmatarian Facebook page. Please “like” me and check out a few photos! You can bet that this mango avocado salad was on the kitchen island along with some other yummy apps. When I was in search of another dish to serve, I thought of my amazing client and friend Maureen!
Fun story of how I met Maureen. Back when I worked at Emmett Rode Salon in Lincoln park, I was new there and trying to build my clientele. I plastered flyers all over that town. I hated doing it too. I went far and wide and put some on the back board at Karyn’s raw cafe. That’s how I met Maureen. She was interested in the organic hair color line that I use and took her chances and called me up. Any marketing person knows the feedback you get from a flyer. It’s like 1% or something ridiculous. I don’t know why I bothered? No, I take that back. I got an amazing friend out of it! Who would have know that Maureen and I would hit it off so well and have tons of fun at our hair sessions every few weeks since!? Every time I see Maureen she hooks me up with the most amazing raw food! She makes wonderful green smoothies for us and our conversations are so much fun and in depth. I appreciate you Maureen! You are the best!
Maureen has been raving about this salad since I met her. She makes it for so many parties and occasions that she deserves the title. She didn’t make this one up though. I will get to that in a sec. Anyway, she swears people just devour this. I often wondered about it and it was on my “list” to try and then she served it to me a few weeks ago! OMG. She was not kidding! Something about this salad. It’s a refreshing change and very flavorful. A must try!
Maureen has a great hook-up herself. This is my third part to the story. Maureen has a really great friend named Linda who is a fabulous Raw food Chef! Hence, where all of Maureen’s raw food comes from that she in turn shares with me when I visit. Can you say… Lucky! Although I don’t know Linda personally, I feel like I do. She sounds like such a cool person. Linda owns Green Spirit – healthy living Please check out her great website! Linda offers home delivered raw food packages that are very reasonable. She has classes where you can learn how to create raw food for yourself and there are a lot of recipes on her website too. If she only wasn’t so far away from where I live, I would be there bugging her all the time! I do plan on taking a few of her classes in the near future and giving you a much more in depth review of Green Spirit! I love that places like this exist! Thank you Linda! Your food is amazing!!! This I know, because I have tried so many of your different dishes. Each one full of flavor and presented beautifully! So. A long story short. This recipe for Mango Avocado salad is originally from the famous Linda! Please try it out for yourself and please check out Green Spirit if you are in or near the North Chicago area! You will love the food!!!
Well here it is… The Famous Mango Avocado Salad!
Combine all ingredients and toss gently. Serve immediately.
Note* I have also tasted this recipe with just a small amount of diced (very tiny) red bell pepper. Maybe a tablespoon, possibly more. It’s great for added color. I had enough red colors running through my party theme as far as food goes, so I chose to leave out the red pepper!",en,web
"A squeaking stationary bike, an uncomfortable seat, an exercise bike without resistance... follow our buying tips and advice to avoid bad surprises! Here are the 10 most important criteria to look for when choosing an exercise bike.
​The flywheel weight determines the comfort and fluidity of cycling. The higher is the weight, the more fluid and comfortable will the cycling be on the stationary bike. When the flywheel is too light, you may feel jolts when pedaling. The flywheel weight that you choose will therefore depend on your goals, whether you aim for climbing Mont Ventoux or simply cycling peacefully around the lake, and secondly on your budget, rather 300-600€ or towards 1.000€ or more.
OUR ADVICE : We recommend to choose a stationary bike with a flywheel of at least 7 kg for a comfortable pedaling without bumps. If you plan to exercise 2 to 3 times a week, you should consider a stationary bike with a flywheel above 9 kg.
2) The resistance : mechanical or magnetic?
The mechanical resistance is activated by turning the adjustment wheel on the stationary bike, whereas the magnetic resistance can be directly modified from the bike's console (controlling a magnet that comes into contact with the wheel of the bike). Only the magnetic resistance allows you to have predefined workout programs with dynamic change of the resistance.
The watts are a unit of measure of your pedaling power and are a good indication of the maximal power a bike can provide. High watts enable you to have a more precise and efficient training exercise. For example the stationary bike Kettler Ergo S has got a maximum of 600 watts. On the other hand the exercise bike Skandika Cardiobike Ulisses has got a maximum of 350 Watts.
4) The console: with or without Bluetooth ?
The stationary bike's console had not been changing for ages... although our phones and screens keep evolving! The Bluetooth connection remedied that awkward (and unacceptable) situation since it allows to connect a smartphone, an iPhone, iPad or tablet to the exercise bike wirelessly and use it as the bike's console.It is then possible to control the bike's resistance directly from one's smartphone, create new training programs and customize them, follow one's training stats and even play a video game which is interactive with the speed and the resistance of the stationary bike (see the Vescape exercise bike app). The Bluetooth is therefore a must!
On the left: 36 buttons, on the right: 3 buttons. More user friendly and intuitive, isn't it?
Make sure the seat can be adjusted vertically to be able to adjust it to the height of your hips as it will prevent you from hurting your back and joints. The horizontal adjustment is a plus but is not necessary.
6) The handlebars: adjustable as well?
Make sure that the height of the handlebars can be adjusted so that you will be able to find your optimal position on the bike.
7) Upright bike or recumbent bike?
The stationary bike that we all know is the upright bike. The recumbent bike has a back support and enables you to seat properly on what looks like a chair. The recumbent bike is less demanding than the upright bike. Moreove, the range of the recumbent bikes is much more limited.
Have a look at the maximum user weight before buying your exercise bike. The stationary bikes from middle and high range usually support up to 130-150 kg whereas the cheapest models only allow up to 90-100 kg.
Design both means the ""industrial"" conception or design but also its appearance (which is also important!). Look carefully at the material before buying your stationary bike: Are the pieces in metal (more durable) or in plastic? And choose an exercise bike that you like since it will probably stay in your bedroom or your living room!
10) Last but not least: the price of the exercise bike!
The price of an exercise bike may vary a lot, unfortunately like its quality! A 150 € bike is obviously much less robust than a 650 € bike, it has usually not the same pedaling fluidity and comfort (see 1. flywheel weight) and may be loud or even squeak after some time (even some days for the lowest quality stationary bikes). It is therefore recommended to think twice before buying a cheap exercise bike that won't last more than a few weeks... and maybe invest a bit more in quality and durability. After all, good health and condition have no price ;) almost! According to these criteria, our favorite at the moment is the DKN AM-3i.",en,web

"In the picks we make for the paper today, I called for a 27-21 victory by Seattle tonight against the 49ers.
— The home field advantage. Seattle is simply just so hard to beat at home right now, going 8-0 last season and 17-7 under Pete Carroll (and 59-29 in the history of CenturyLink Field). Location, location, location is definitely one mantra that suits the Seahawks right now.
— Turnovers. Seattle gets so many home field wins by forcing turnovers — something that the home crowd undoubtedly plays a role in by getting opponents off their game, even if just for a split second. Seattle is 18-3 under Carroll when winning the turnover battle and have finished in the top eight in turnovers each of the past two years and won the turnover battle last week at Carolina, seeming to prove none of it is a fluke.
— Marshawn Lynch. He has rushed for 100 yards or more the last three times Seattle has played the 49ers. And simply put, he and the Seahawks seem to know the way to exploit a San Francisco defense that has looked a little more vulnerable of late.
— The return of Cliff Avril. He should help the pass rush quite a bit, and just in time.
Think I’m right on? Crazy? As always, happy to hear your views in the comments section.",en,web

"a vast and beautiful sky spreads endlessly in varying shades of blue.
Trees dance as I pass, waving their leaves in rhythm to the erratic strings of Vivaldi.
The wind plays cheerfully with my hair as the afternoon sun warms my face.
My soul is free; my spirit soaring.
For this moment in time, my thoughts are my own.
I find myself giddy with the pure joy of it all.
I had a total bipolar meltdown on my dad.
He was, at first, completely blindsided, and then perplexed.
I usually meltdown on my mom, who knows to just let it ride until the event is over.
But she wasn’t there and I was melting down in real time.
I think it was good for him, my Dad, that is, to see me as I have a propensity to be.
Totally crazy, on the edge of straight-jacket territory.
I try to shield him from this side of me, because, well, at the risk of starting a riot, he is my dad and is, with abject certainty, a man.
Men rarely understand the astounding psyche of women.
Don’t roll your eyes and pretend to be insulted.
Add bipolar to the mix and a total discombobulation takes over.
He is my, second only to Jesus and third to John Robert (who is dead, by the way), my hero.
A man who’s integrity I would bet my last dime on.
But he isn’t my mom.
He wants desperately to pat me on the head and tell me all is ok.
I’M HAVING A MELTDOWN, WHERE IS MY MOTHER?
In my own defense, I didn’t say that.
I wanted to, but felt the ramifications would skew the effort to find out WHERE THE HELL my mom was.
So I cried, sobbed, made little sense while blindly clinging to my Dad.
ever be quite the same.
It’s a bit, I suppose, like trying raw oysters.
It sounds gross, but the rewards … well, they, by spades, outweigh the risks.
I hope, some day, to eat raw oysters with my dad.
A small, and yet ambiguous dream.
He hugged me while I was sobbing incoherently and told me he loved me, no matter what.
I’m standing on the front porch as the day completes itself.
The sun is setting over a field fresh with young wildflowers and high, lovely hay-grass that will grow tall and be mowed mid-summer.
It smells so good; nearly, but not quite as good as freshly turned earth in early Spring.
The soon-to-be full moon will shortly rise over budding trees freed from their winter solitude.
After this night, changes will come.
I am uncertain of the changes, but am trying to make myself ready for what will happen in my brain.
How odd this must sound.
I have things I must contend with that will very likely alter the way I see everything, including the moon.
It has been a difficult decision to make; this knowing that the way my brain perceives things and people and emotions will change.
I am only what I am, and if I cannot be what I am then I could very possibly be what I have always feared.
I have dear friends who are angry with me, who have not forgiven me for things I was not aware of.
While that hurts me now, next week it will likely be irrelevant.
There is a better then average chance then I will not remember that.
A curse more than a blessing for I am sorry but may not recall my remorse.
I sacrifice one madness for another.
Where, I ask, is the sanity in that?
This night, my last night without the influence of medication, I watch for the moon and hope, that when the lightning bugs come, I will be happy to see them.
I have always found joy in the lightning bugs.
For the first time I can recall, I am not an optimist.
That, in itself, frightens me.
And I dislike being afraid nearly as much as I dislike knowing I am potentially sacrificing my identity.
I suppose I am, after all, a coward.
By showing me what He sees through the eyes He sees them with.
And by allowing me to capture on film that which He chooses to show me.
Being a photographer is one of His greatest gifts to me and I don’t take His beauty lightly.
I am, in the space of time that I walk through the beauty of creation, one with that creation.
I am part of that which lives, thrives and survives.
He reminds me every day of His love for me by showing me the wonders of the earth He created, of His beauty and, for whatever reason, He allows me to see it through His perfect eyes. I am often blinded by life, by moments, by disappointments and disillusionment, but He reminds me, every single day, that I am His.
Through the fragrant blooms of springtime that make their way even while winter tries to force his hand. They are strong and resilient, those blooms. Strong-willed and fearless as they burst forth with courage and strength.
Through the fireflies of summer, which frolic beneath a summer moon and compete with the magnificence of the stars. They blink and fade, wander and mesmerize, bringing magic and comfort and the promise of something wonderful.
Like a moth to a flame, so the fireflies are drawn to the moon of summer.
Through the colorful leaves that adorn the trees that catch my eye, the smell of decay on the ground mixed with the subtle scent of of beauty that can only be felt in the heart. The joyous chatter of the brilliance of fall as it rains down on forgotten paths and leaves the mind reeling with possibilities.
Through the winter, the cold air and frigid temperatures that can freeze a waterfall in her tracks, making her song one of unrivaled silence as her beauty emanates praise and thanksgiving.
A bubbling creek becomes suspended in something, motionless and full of such magic that only the heart can understand it. Some things are so rare, so precious, so full of beauty that nothing is left but to offer praise.
Seeing it, immersing myself in it, becoming a part of it reminds me that I, too am, a child of the creator.
His beauty unfolds before me in the misty rain of barren landscapes, foggy sunrises behind mountains and beneath a black sky glittering with stars.
I am blessed and, when I forget that, He reminds me with His magnificence.
From my driveway, I am reminded that i am worth His magnificence.
Unequivocally, my favorite line of any song I have ever heard.
A bold statement, yes, I know, especially considering that I have heard thousands and thousands of songs in the decades of my life.
It doesn’t change this revelation in the least. I first heard this song less than 72 hours ago. It has been around for a while. As a matter of fact, it was released eight years ago on my birthday.
I had to know more about who wrote words that surpassed any I have ever heard. Maybe they struck a chord in me because I have a deep love and respect for trees and, on occasion, imagine myself to be one; swaying in the wind, basking in the sun, playing in the moonlight beneath a sky bursting with stars.
Being a seeker of knowledge, I went in search of answers.
The song was written by an independent singer/songwriter named John Mark McMillan. In an interview, he says that he wrote this the day after his best friend died after sustaining injuries in a terrible car accident. In the same interview, he tells of his friend, Stephen Coffey, a youth minister for Morning Star Ministries who said aloud the words “I would give my life today if it would shake the youth of the nation” the morning before the accident.
John Mark wrote the song the next day. He says that the love he is singing about is not a pretty “Hollywood hot-pink” love, but the kind of love that is willing to love even when things are difficult and messy. He goes on to say that “This song isn’t a celebration of weakness and anger. It’s a celebration of a God who would want to hang with us through those things, who would want to be a part of our lives through those things, and,despite who we are, He would want to be a part of us, our community and our family”.
I have listened to this song at least 200 times since I first heard it. I am listening to it now. I cannot pull myself away from what it says to me, how it makes me feel, where it takes me.
I imagine, before the anniversary of the song’s release, (on my birthday), I will listen to it several hundred more times. I know every note, every sound, every pitch, every word and I hold them deep inside of me.
They make me want to sing; the make me want to cry. But not tears of sadness, but ones of joy and celebration that even with all my imperfectness, I am loved and cherished by a Savior that I adore.
I have taken the blinders from my eyes, the plastic wrap from my mirrors and have embraced life with a fullness and freedom that I have never quite been able to achieve.
The freedom to love, to be loved, to seek and, in seeking, expect to find.
I will never be the same again and that may be one of the most beautiful gifts I have ever been given.
I’m putting a link to John Mark’s version. I have heard several artists sing it in the last couple of days, but this version, his version, is by far my favorite.
John Mark McMillan ~ How He Loves ….
there is an emptiness. A change in the air, the sky, the trees, the grass, the morning, that reminds us that time is passing.
In those long months of seemingly colorless moments, there is a beauty that can only be found in Winter.
Just as each season has its own to offer, Winter is no different.
The trees will be bare of leaves and standing tall and proud, naked sentries during the cold and dreary months of winter.
And then there is snow.
Snow cannot be discounted as one of the most marvelous sights of all creation.
Mornings quieted under a blanket of white that transcends all rational thought. How can something be so silent and still be so beautiful?
The sound of snow falling, the soft “pfft” it makes as it falls, one flake upon another until there are inches to be measured, is a sound of solace.
It reminds me a bit of a piano. It is no secret that I love the piano and have a deep and awe-inspired respect for piano players. And the snow, as it makes its soft sound while falling makes music that nothing else in nature can duplicate.
I look forward to the snow, laying heavy on the bare branches of the trees, covering the brown grass and leaving the road white, tire and animal tracks evident in its otherwise malevolent stillness.
October is gone, November is here and before we can be fully accustomed to the cold of winter, the tulips of spring will be blooming.
Mother Nature will have her turn again come springtime, but the here and now belongs to Old Man Winter.
He is a shrewd and unpredictable one and I tend to think he likes it that way.
Although October has officially ended, I feel the need to share one of my favorite songs by one of my favorite artists just to make it official.
Enjoy the remnants of Autumn, relish every day, live every moment and take nothing for granted.
There is, after all, no promise of another day so in actuality, this may very well be the last one.
Look at it, really look at it and see the beauty that surrounds you. There will never be a moment exactly like the one we are in now. Time marches on.
That is what time does. Don’t hold its nature against it. Instead, embrace it and enjoy each segment as though it were the last.
There can, if each moment is enjoyed and embraced, be no regrets for a life not lived.
Until next time, be well, my friends … be well.",en,books
"Car has 105k miles on it. Changed the spark plugs today in anticipation of taking a 2,600 mile road trip later this summer. Started on the driver side, removed driver side plastic cover, engine cover already off, and all 4 old plugs on that side came out easy and and new ones went in very easy. Toughest location was first plug because the dip stick tube is partially in the way. Making the job a lot easier I used a gearwrench sparkplug tool, along with a universal knuckle, and attached to that various straight extensions on my socket wrench to get at some of the tighter angles required.
Passenger side requires removal of air-filter box cover and the passenger side plastic box breather assembly that is attached to the throttle body. One bolt needs to be removed and then detach one thin hose and one larger hose to remove the plastic box breather assembly. First two plugs are easy in and out on passenger side. The last two are tighter spaces - third plug is tight on the passenger side fuse box, then the last rearmost plug is very tight on the battery case. Working carefully it was still not that hard to pull the coils, plugs and install new in those tight spaces using just the gear wrench with universal knuckle joint and various length extensions.
One critical item is to always reinstall the new plug just gently rotating gearwrench containing new plug by hand. They go in and screw down super smooth - gently finger tighten until you meet hard stop and then use socket about 1/2 to 3/4 turn or so until you feel the compression washer/gasket compress down. Do not over tighten. Manual says to use a torque wrench but limited access with my TW made that impracticable.
I used a very small flat head screwdriver to pry up (mostly sideways and out) the little locking tab that locks the electrical connector to each coil. This made getting the connectors off without damaging or pulling wire loose much easier.
First time plug change for the LS, doing the job going slowly and carefully, taking my time was just over 2.5 hours. If I had to do it again I could do it in 90 minutes.
Only surprise was the 3rd plug on passenger side was in only finger tight...likely from the factory. The plug looked different than the 7 others in that it had uneven color and wear pattern so I assume it may have had some amount of ignition blow by but not enough to throw a code.
Hard to believe Lexus wants supposedly quotes apprx $500 to do replace plugs.

The plugs I used have a relatively soft metal compression washer/gasket on them.
The plugs screwed in (by hand) very smoothly and it was very easy to tell when they had snugged up. Then it is actually very easy to feel the washer compress at the base of the plug and stop as you turn the extra 1/2 to 3/4 rotation with the socket (after plugs is finger tight). Given the close tolerances involved and the very low torque setting (17 ft/lbs) I trust my experience and feel snugging down by hand way more than trying to use my 1/2 inch torque wrench which is high quality but I bet not super accurate at such a low setting. It is much better than feel at getting 82 ft/lbs on the lug nuts.
Gotcha, the BMW as well wants 17 ft. lbs. Your torque wrench would likely need to have an upper range of no more than 75 (mine is a 3/8 5-75), because torque wrenches are inaccurate below 20% of their upper range. We had this huge never ending thread on the BMW forum years ago where someone stripped all 6 cylinders, and said his torque wrench was from work, was really high end and had a range of like 1-20 ft. lbs. with a NIST calibration, so no way at all he overtorqued (everyone said not rocket science only way you stripped all 6 was too much torque).
Never heard of anti-seize doing that. Have always (at least for fifty years) set spark plugs by feel. I use a very short ratchet and grip the head of the wrench while tightening to snug. This is for aluminum heads. I use a DROP of anti-seize.
I think what may have happened to the BMW is he stripped the threads taking them out. Very common with some engine designs and why it is smart to replace spark plugs at about 50 K miles. I sometimes shoot PB Blaster down on the spark plugs before removing them. I do this when the engine is warm.
Believe it or not, some Ford engines need the cylinder head replaced if the plugs are to be removed. It is that bad.
My plugs in the LS had been in for 105k miles - I was also concerned the plugs might be difficult to break loose and remove since they had been in for 12 years and 105k miles but they came loose very easy and screwed out very smoothly. Actually one of my plugs - the 2cd to rear-most on passenger side was in only hand tight. It came out without any resistance at all. Weird because the plugs had never been touched since the car was brand new so it must have been installed without snugging the compression washer at the factory. For 105k miles the engine ran smooth as silk despite the slightly loose plug. I have noticed that changing plugs the engine seems even smoother now - honestly difficult to tell engine is even running at stop lights.
Waiting to 120k to do the job, but not looking forward to it lol Sure it will be fine. Having only a 1 car garage, whenever I am working on a car outside, I make sure that at least one car is on the street, just in case (we have a pad so those cars cannot get past a car in the driveway).
I agree with all....likely by feel is a sure fire way that things would be ok. With a torque wrench, in theory, it's better, but there are other factors. Putting anti seize then setting to 17 ft. lbs. will cause the torque wrench to be off. The drain plug on my wife's car is a lesson in doing by hand. I should not have been using a 1/2"" ratchet last Sat. When I redid I switched to 3/8"". That tapered bolt just keeps spinning--I don't have an inch lb. torque wrench, so I attempted to set my wrench to 9 ft. lbs. It never reached it (inaccurate below 15 as it's 5-75). I have seen a youtube of a guy using an inch lb. torque wrench and it beeped for the same job. So that plug was done by hand and no leaks once it had thread sealant.
Those DIY spark plug change just be mindful of the clips. I've done two LS spark plug changes, the first one was no issues at all, the second one I accidentally pulled out one of the wires on the coil pack clip. It was the rear passenger side which is a little harder to reach over and pull out. The clips don't have much to grab onto so you end up trying to use the wires to pull up on and you should try your best not to do that. The wires are small in the first place and then you couple that with the age and all the heat cycles it doesn't take a whole lot to break the wires. Otherwise it's a pretty straight forward job especially if you have spark plug wrench like this.",en,web

"I am so excited that I had an opportunity to hang out with my friends and colleagues: Principal, Ryan Brock(De Portola) and Principal, Courtney Rizzo (Farb). We attended the 1st Annual Choral Cluster Concert on Wednesday evening.The students from Serra, De Portola and Farb sang with passion and pride. I want to once again thank our musical Director, Brad Pulverenti for an outstanding job.
We can only expect more great things from Serra High School students.
On Saturday March 7th 2015 Serra High School hosted the first annual Synergy Leadership Summit presented by IMIN arc after school program. Over 180 students from 12 different high schools attended workshops on different aspects of leadership, and were taught how those skills are transferable to each and every one of their campuses.
After nearly a month of preparations with students stressing over who to take, how to ask, and what to wear, the night came. Gravity, Serra's 2015 Winter Formal, took place at the Reuben H. Fleet Science Center on Saturday the 7th of March.
Serra Speech & Debate Club's 9th graders continue to steal the spotlight!
Nathan Tran, a freshman at Serra High School won a Lions Club speech contest on water conservation in February. He was given a certificate and check for $150 for his achievement. Nathan, who is the treasurer of Serra's newly formed Speech and Debate Club, also won first place in January at a speech competition conducted at Serra High School.
On Saturday March 21, 2015, 8th grade students from Farb and DePortola along with 9th graders from Serra were treated with a sneak preview of the changes in SAT beginning in March of 2016. Led by Karla Whitaker from Cal-SOAP (The California Student Opportunity and Access Program) out of UCSD, students met at Serra for fours hours of information and instruction. Key to the changes are no penalty for wrong answers, a 50 minute optional essay, more curriculum based, and evidence based reading, writing, and math. Both the SAT and ACT are phasing in testing electronically and phasing out paper and pencil tasks.

This past weekend Serra 9th grade Varsity Golfer April Ranches won the National Tournament Spring Series Tournament held this weekend at the Sycuan Resort where she was competing against a field of 23 other 15-18 year old young lady golfers from CA, Nevada and Arizona.
The powderpuff game was a success! Yes, a couple of things were last minute but we still found a way to pull it off. The transition from playing on the field to coaching on the sideline was a great experience! From teaching the girls the difference between offense and defense to executing plays perfectly, it was all worth it. The victory this year is the first of two. With all of the hard work that both the seniors and juniors put in, led to a score of 18-13 with the juniors on top. There were some ""opposing opinions"" on the field, but I think that it was only the competitive aspect of the game. Overall the game was a success and everyone had fun with no injuries.
Students must sign up no later than noon on Friday 4/10.",en,web
"Michael Berning, coordinator of music for the Kettering Schools, had a chance meeting with Marcia Neel several years ago at the OMEA Professional Development Conference. ""Marcia was giving a presentation on a subject I was interested in and it had been a really long conference day..I snuck in the back of the room and grabbed a seat just in time to hear her tell the packed house that she started her interest in music in Kettering Schools"" Berning recalls. ""I honestly can't remember much about her presentation but I knew I had to stick around to meet this dynamic educator and speaker afterwards."" Since that first meeting Berning and Neel have kept in touch sharing thoughts and inspiration about music education, often catching up on twitter. Berning and the Kettering music team hosted Marcia at Fairmont a year or so later for a day of observations and sharing. ""Marcia is certainly a major player in the music education scene nationally and we are so proud to call her one of our very own!""
A veteran of 37 years in public school music education, Marcia MacCagno Neel has directed successful choral music programs in Connecticut, Ohio, Massachusetts and Nevada. She graduated from Fairmont West High School in 1967, where she was an active participant in the Choral Music Program directed by Gene Seeberger. Marcia fully credits Mr. Seeberger for cultivating her love of choral music education through the many conducting and accompanying experiences he provided her over the five (5) years that she sang with him beginning in the 8th grade at Barnes JHS. She received her Bachelors Degree in Music Education, with a concentration in Choral Music, from Miami University and her Master of Arts Degree in History and her administrative credential from the University of Nevada Las Vegas.
Marcia was subsequently appointed Secondary Fine Arts Supervisor for the Clark County School District—the nation’s fifth largest—headquartered in Las Vegas, NV, where she served for 14 years. During the course of those years, she led the Secondary Music Education Program to a total class count of over 55,000 in 56 middle and 38 high school music programs and over 100,000 in Secondary Fine and Performing Arts overall. Her greatest pride was in knowing that all of the students in each of the district’s secondary schools were provided with an equal opportunity to study music.
Elected to numerous leadership positions, Marcia has served as Western Division President of NAfME; President of the Nevada Music Educators Association (two separate terms); and President of the Nevada Choral Directors Association. She was appointed by two Nevada governors to sit on the Goals 2000 Panel and in that capacity, co-chaired the team responsible for the writing of Nevada's Content Standards in Arts Education. In 1993, The Disney Channel selected Marcia as their National Performing Arts Teacher of the Year.
Marcia now serves as president of Music Education Consultants, Inc., a consortium of music education professionals which works with a variety of educational organizations, arts associations, and school districts to foster the growth and breadth of standards-based, music education programs. She also serves as Education Advisor to the Music Achievement Council, a 501(c)(6) organization whose purpose is to enable more students to begin and continue in instrumental music programs through effective professional development programs for music educators and was recently named Senior Director of Education for Yamaha Corporation of America’s Band and Orchestral Division.

"Representatives from 15 area nonprofits met to mingle and exchange ideas Wednesday during a Flagler Charity Reception at the Hammock Dunes Club.
It was an opportunity for organizations that provide residents of Flagler and Volusia counties with health, wellness, recovery, elder care and education services, among other things, to gather in one place and share information in a relaxed environment.
Tom Lutz, a retired business owner who lives in Hammock Dunes and organized the reception, said it took 10 months to put together as he spent time with members of each organization invited to participate in the private reception. A first of its kind for the area, Lutz said he was motivated by the need to raise awareness about the way local charitable organizations spend money for the people they help. Allowing no solicitation, simply a sharing of information, guests were encouraged to get to know one another and ask questions.
“I’m interested in making people aware of all the charities and agencies in Flagler County that help people,” Lutz said.
Members of organizations such as the Children’s Advocacy Center were grateful for the opportunity to showcase their missions.
Rack cards containing information on each group’s mission, funding sources and needs were available while representatives talked with guests or introduced those who have been helped by their organization.
Dr. Stephen Bickel and Dr. Shinoo Waingankar provided information about the Flagler County Free Clinic. Bickel, who retired when he moved to Flagler County, said he started volunteering “on a trial basis” at the clinic.

"This database is an ongoing effort to update official fiscal data by the Bank and the Inter-American Center of Tax Administrations, and with the collaboration of OECD and ECLAC. The Equivalent Fiscal Pressure indicator makes use of a methodology that better reflects the particularities of the mobilization of fiscal resources in the region, and consists of three elements: 1) Traditional tax collection, which includes all taxes and fees levied at all levels of government; 2) Compulsory social security contributions, whether public or private, mostly to pension and health systems; and 3) Non-tax revenues derived from the exploitation of natural resources, whether renewable or not; i.e., fees, royalties, dividends paid and net profits from public enterprises. The information is presented broken down by type of tax at every level of government. The series are adjusted with updated GDP values for each country and information that becomes available for municipalities and social security, which tend to have a longer lag period compared to other tax statistics.

The Dataset of Housing Indicators aims to give users access to quality information regarding urban housing and development, including policies and best practices related to housing conditions in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico.
Child well-being matters for both ethical and economic reasons as children who flourish in the early years are more likely to become healthy, productive citizens later in life. This year’s edition of Development in the Americas (DIA) focuses on the well-being of children from conception to 8 years of age and makes the case for public intervention in improving child outcomes. The process of child development—physical, communicational, cognitive, and socio-emotional— does not unfold on its own, but is shaped by the experiences children accumulate at home, in daycare centers, and at school. Parents, relatives, other caregivers, teachers, and government all have a hand in shaping those experiences. This book offers suggestions for public policy to improve those experiences in ways that would certainly shape children’s lives and the face of the societies they live in for years to come.
This database delivers information about several management systems, classified in five “pillars” of the public sector management cycle that are considered important for the implementation of Management for Development Results (MfDR): (i) results-based planning, (ii) results-based budgeting, (iii) public financial management (including auditing and procurement), (iv) program and project management (including the public investment system), and (v) monitoring and evaluation of public management. These pillars are broken down into components that track the maturity of institutional systems. The components are in turn composed of indicators and minimum requirements that these systems must have in an MfDR environment. The most of these requirements are categorized alternatively as: the requirement is met, partially met, or is not met.

I bought this piano lamp for the piano at church and it looks beautiful and functions great. At first it didn't turn on and off, but after contacting Lucynda , she thought it might be the adapter. She sent me a new one very quickly and sure enough, that was it. It works beautifully now. Thank you Cocoweb! Love my light!
First of all, the color on this is just stunning, The quality is definitely one of the best. I am thoroughly impressed with this.
This lamp is a wonderful compliment to our piano. I was concerned about buying a relatively expensive lamp over the internet, but it met and exceeded my expectations. The ease of adjustment and quality of knobs is top-notch, and I enjoy the using the touch-sensitive body to turn on/off and adjust the intensity level. The LED light makes our sheet music easy to read when the room is dark.

"Why did human beings first begin to write history? Lisa Irene Hau argues that a driving force among Greek historians was the desire to use the past to teach lessons about the present and for the future. She uncovers the moral messages of the ancient Greek writers of history and the techniques they used to bring them across. Hau also shows how moral didacticism was an integral part of the writing of history from its inception in the 5th century BC, how it developed over the next 500 years in parallel with the development of historiography as a genre and how the moral messages on display remained surprisingly stable across this period. For the ancient Greek historiographers, moral didacticism was a way of making sense of the past and making it relevant to the present; but this does not mean that they falsified events: truth and morality were compatible and synergistic ends. ; Lisa Irene Hau argues that a driving force among Greek historians was the desire to use the past to teach lessons about the present and for the future.

Hau deploys the overt moralising of the Hellenistic historians to illuminate the more implicit and thought-provoking moralising of their Classical forebears. Among other questions she asks: does moral didacticism make for bad historiography? Was it simply a lens for viewing events, or could it drive wholesale invention?

"Although the sparks of excitement during the Fourth of July came and went with the usual fanfare, canine owners around the United States decided to try something a little offbeat: offering dog-friendly treats to their canine friends to quell firework-related anxieties. This trend has been covered by the New York Times, with pet owners touting the growing advantages of Cannabidiol, or CBD.
Betsy and Andy Firebaugh of Santa Cruz, Calif. told NPR they discovered the idea to treat their dog’s Fourth of July anxieties with CBD after they tested a CBD supplement for one of their socially-anxious Australian shepherds, Angus. Originally skittish around new visitors, Angus’s positive response to the supplement inspired the couple to give CBD to their other dog, Seamus, who also deals with anxieties related to loud noises.
The study also advises that individuals must take caution: while there is scientific evidence detailing the therapeutic benefits of CBD, the topic remains infrequently researched, especially in canines.

These icons can be used on the web or in any software program capable of working with SVG graphics.
Thanks to Dan Leech for this helpful resource!
FYI – SVG’s are Scalable Vector Graphics and work the same way a font does. The letter “A” in a font is built using a mathematical formula to outline the shape of the letter. Then a fill can be applied to that shape outline. You can imagine in Microsoft Word having the letter A on the page and making it really tiny in size, or really large in size. No matter the size, the mathematical formula used to draw the outline of the shape is just multiplied by a constant to make it larger (smaller), thereby always rendering the shape with perfectly crisp and sharp graphics. Any SVG or purely vector-based graphic works this way. It’s why a properly designed logo can be 1″ small, or 10′ across and still be razor sharp and clear!",en,reference

"Hydroelectric power or hydropower is the power generated by harnessing the power of moving water.
Flowing water creates energy that can be captured and turned into electricity that is both inexpensive and abundant, it is the largest source of emissions-free, renewable electricity worldwide.
Hydropower is very convenient because it can respond quickly to fluctuations in demand. The production of hydroelectricity is often slowed in the night time when people use less energy. When a facility is functioning, no water is wasted or released in an altered state; it simply returns unharmed to continue the hydrologic cycle. The reservoir of water resulting from dam construction, which is essentially, stored energy.
Power is generated in stations; these electrical generators are attached to a turbine device which spins at great speeds as a result of water rushing through them. These power station turbines are much more efficient at extracting the kinetic energy from the moving water and converting that energy it into power through these generators.
The most common type of hydroelectric power plant uses a dam on a river to store water in a reservoir. Water released from the reservoir flows through a turbine, spinning it, which in turn activates a generator to produce electricity. A dam and reservoir is a flexible source of electricity since the amount produced by the station can be changed up or down very quickly to adapt to changing energy demands. The power extracted from the water depends on the volume and on the difference in height between the source and the water's outflow.
Run-of-the-river hydroelectric stations are those with small or no reservoir capacity, so that only the water coming from upstream is available for generation at that moment, it spins the turbine blades by capturing the kinetic energy of the moving water in the river, and any oversupply must pass unused. The volume and speed of water is not augmented by a dam. A constant supply of water from a lake or existing reservoir upstream is a significant advantage in choosing sites for run-of-the-river, they have much less ability to control the amount and timing of when electricity is generated.
Another type of hydroelectric power plant is called a pumped storage plant. This method produces electricity to supply high peak demands by moving water between reservoirs at different elevations. At times of low electrical demand, the excess generation capacity is used to pump water into the higher reservoir. When the demand becomes greater, water is released back into the lower reservoir through a turbine.
A tidal power station makes use of the daily rise and fall of ocean water due to tides. Tidal power is viable in a relatively small number of locations around the world.
Although the generation of hydropower does not emit air pollution or greenhouse gas emissions, it can have negative environmental and social consequences.
Dams that have flooded areas with live vegetation can emit methane.
Hydropower projects can reduce the flows in rivers downstream, lowering the flows in a river can alter water temperatures and degrade habitat for plants and animals.
Dams can also block the migration of fish that swim upstream to reach spawning grounds.
The flooding of land to create reservoirs can also eliminate areas where people live or grow crops.",en,reference
"This book addresses the gap between the espoused importance of organizational human capital and how it is actually reported and assessed. It also discusses the current and potential uses of human capital measurement and a way for HR to position itself among other business functions such as finance, accounting, and operations. Readers will finish with an understanding of approaches for the valuation of a firm’s human capital, practical applications for the economic analysis of human capital, and gaps that are ripe for research and practice to address.
This chapter provides an overview of the author’s background‚ qualifications and perspective on human capital. It outlines the book’s purpose‚ what readers can expect to gain and a description of each chapter’s content. In short‚ human capital is defined for this book’s purpose as the organization’s assembled‚ trained and experienced workforce. In keeping with the author’s experience‚ the material is grounded in scholarly research and practitioner based knowledge‚ providing readers with a conceptual and applied understanding of approaches to human capital valuation. This chapter also clarifies what the book is not—that it is not an accounting approach‚ per se‚ to the valuation of human capital.
This chapter describes the shifting perspective of human capital over time and how it is now increasingly considered an important business asset to be quantified. It discusses the current and potential uses of human capital measurement, introduces and defines basic terms that are essential to understanding human capital valuation, and generally sets the stage for the subsequent chapters.
This chapter provides an overview of the basic logic and steps involved in applying the cost approach. The cost approach is based on the economic principle of substitution, which equates the value of human capital to the cost to create a substitute workforce of comparable utility. Costs considered in applying this valuation method to the assembled workforce pertain to recruitment, hiring, training, lost productivity and entrepreneurial return. An illustrative example is provided. Further considerations and refinements of the cost approach are elaborated in chap. 4. In addition to presenting the fundamentals of conducting the cost approach, this chapter discusses the conceptual reasoning and legal precedents that justify the cost approach as an acceptable, and actually preferred method for workforce valuations.
This chapter provides further discussion of several key assumptions underlying the cost approach and suggests ways to add rigor to the cost evaluation. Many of these points were brought up throughout the preceding chapters in a cursory fashion. We delve into further detail here in order to gain a more critical understanding of the primary approach to valuing the assembled workforce. Specific topics include the conceptual rationale of the assembled workforce as an “owned” asset, a closer look at the entrepreneurial return and lost productivity, refinements to workforce assemblage costs, and the special circumstances surrounding non-fungible and short-term workers.
This chapter examines the income approach, an approach based on the economic principle of anticipation of future benefits. Under the income approach, valuation of human capital requires analysis of the expected net income stream directly attributable to the workforce. This chapter reviews several techniques for deriving the present value of the anticipated economic benefits of human capital. Economic benefits are measured as the value of worker outputs contributed to the firm, or alternatively, via employee earnings as a proxy of the value employees contribute to the organization, and as the excess earnings remaining after allocating an appropriate amount of earnings to all other assets of the business. Also discussed are the conceptual logic of the income approach and its contrast with the cost approach.
This chapter examines the market approach to value, also known as the sales comparison approach. The market approach determines the value of an asset based on the selling price of comparable assets, in keeping with the economic principle of substitution. This chapter discusses the conceptual logic of the market approach and reviews three potentially acceptable ways to value the assembled workforce through the market approach. The primary method reviewed is the residual market value technique, which allocates the acquisition price of a business to its different components. The two additional techniques considered are a value extraction method that compares sales that are similar in substantive ways with the exception of the assembled workforce in place, and the direct sale of an assembled workforce by itself.
This chapter examines a basic but essential premise underlying the value of the assembled workforce. That is, for the workforce to have an ongoing value, its value producing properties must be sustained. The ongoing value of the assembled workforce is dependent on how the human resources are developed, trained, and employed going forward to maintain, enhance, or deplete the aggregate human capital value. This chapter draws from a range of research literature to describe four areas in which employer investment in employees is shown to impact employee performance contributions over the long-term: regeneration of physical and mental health, regeneration of viable skills, and maintenance of motivation.
This chapter examines organizational social capital, an intangible asset embedded in the quality of the relationships among organizational members. Organizational social capital emphasizes the interconnections between the people that comprise the assembled workforce. It is thought to generate “relational wealth” for an organization by facilitating individual employee commitment to the collective good. This chapter defines and distinguishes the organization’s social capital from its human capital, and discusses research on how social capital enhances the value of the assembled workforce. Also considered are ways organizations can develop social capital and the potential detractions to social capital value.
This chapter provides an overview of other quantitative tools for understanding an organization’s human capital. The previous chapters examined the overall value of the assembled workforce in place, which is the primary focus of this book. However, economic logic and quantitative measurement are also relevant to examining incremental changes in value associated with human capital practices and for informing human capital strategy decisions. In this chapter, we consider utility analysis, human capital metrics and workforce analytics as ways to evaluate specific aspects of the workforce and human resource practices that ultimately have a bearing on the value of the firm’s human capital.",en,academic

"Do You Like To Read Or Write More???
If you had to choose whether to write an article or read an article, which would you choose??? For me, it's write it. Maybe it's because I can type and I tend to write just the way I speak which is usually good enough for me. But what do you like more??? I think most people are readers, just because we've mostly all become lazy to write now a days...what are your thoughts???
I would say i prefer writing than reading, I always feel sleepy when i try to read something, eventhough my handwriting is terrible i always write faster than my other colleagues. I guess i feel bored when i try to read something, on the other hand while writing I tend to be focussed on the matter I am writing.

"Two U.S. officials say preliminary evidence from an interrogation suggests the suspects in the Boston Marathon attack were motivated by religion but were apparently not tied to any Islamic terrorist groups, The Associated Press reported Monday.
The two brothers, born in the Chechen region of Russia, practiced Islam.
The U.S. officials spoke Monday on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the investigation.
Dzhokhar Tsarnaev could face the death penalty in the April 15 bombings at the Boston Marathon that left three people dead and more than 170 injured, prosecutors announced Monday.
Tsarnaev, 19, is charged with conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction ""against persons and property in the U.S. resulting in death"" and one count of malicious destruction of property by means of an explosive device resulting in death, according to the U.S. attorney's office in Massachusetts.
While Tsarnaev and his older brother were on the run, one of them, while brandishing a gun, boasted to a carjacking victim of having committed the bombings, court documents show. A source identified Dzhokhar Tsarnaev as the one who made the boast.
""Did you hear about the Boston explosion? I did that,"" one of the suspects said, according to the affidavit supporting the charges.
A report detailing the carjacking of the Mercedes SUV, filed with the Cambridge Police Department, says the carjacking victim told police that two men told him ""that they were the Boston Marathon bombers and would not kill him because he wasn't American.""
He managed to escape, the report says. The name of the victim is not given.
A clerk in the Office of the Circuit Executive confirmed the filing Monday of charging documents against Tsarnaev. He was charged at his bed in Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital in the presence of a magistrate judge.
Tsarnaev, described as alert and able to respond, was advised of his rights and the charges against him, and prosecutors stated the maximum penalties and moved for detention. Tsarnaev agreed to voluntary detention without prejudice, meaning he can still seek release at a future court hearing. He declined to answer bail questions, and agreed to a probable cause hearing on May 30.
The statutory charges authorize a penalty, upon conviction, of death or imprisonment for life, prosecutors said.
""Although our investigation is ongoing, today's charges bring a successful end to a tragic week for the city of Boston and for our country,"" U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said in a news release from the office of Carmen Ortiz, U.S. attorney for the District of Massachusetts. ""Our thoughts and prayers remain with each of the bombing victims and brave law enforcement professionals who lost their lives or suffered serious injuries as a result of this week's senseless violence.""
Holder also said, ""We will hold those who are responsible for these heinous acts accountable to the fullest extent of the law.""
A White House official said the surviving suspect in the attack will not be tried as an enemy combatant in a military tribunal, according to The Associated Press.
White House spokesman Jay Carney said Tsarnaev will be prosecuted in the federal court system, and President Barack Obama's entire national security team supported the decision, the AP reported.
Tsarnaev was in serious but stable condition, according to the FBI. He had been unable to speak due to a neck and throat injury, the source said. He was also intubated and breathing with the help of a respirator and earlier, officials had said he was not in any condition to be questioned.
It was not clear, however, whether what Tsarnaev was writing was of any value.
A source involved in the investigation said late Sunday the motorist carjacked by Tsarnaev and his older brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, stated the young men planned to drive to New York. The source called such a trip ""extremely unlikely"" given the extent of the manhunt for the suspects after they fatally shot an MIT police officer, carjacked the motorist, and led police on a chase that ended in a shootout in Watertown, Mass. That assessment was proved correct by the events that followed Friday. However, that tip prompted authorities in Connecticut to be on the lookout for the brothers.
The possibility that the suspects might have been headed to New York prompted local authorities to issue an all-points bulletin in the metro area even as officers in Watertown, Mass., conducted a house-by-house search, according to a source.
Authorities believe Dzhokhar Tsarnaev may have tried to shoot himself before he was taken into custody Friday night because of the trajectory and location of the bullet wound in his neck, a source familiar with the investigation said Sunday.
The shot was fired at close range, the source said, suggesting the wound was self-inflicted. He was found hidden in a boat in a backyard in Watertown, bloody and injured. He was able to step out of the boat before being taken into custody after a brief exchange of gunfire with police and then negotiation with FBI agents, said Boston Police Commissioner Edward Davis.
As he lay on a stretcher in the back of an ambulance on the way to hospital, the suspect was mouthing curse words, either to himself or to the armed authorities standing watch in the ambulance as paramedics treated him, the source said.
Boston Mayor Thomas Menino said Sunday authorities are now convinced Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and his brother, who was killed in a shootout with police Friday morning, acted on their own in the bombing.
Police Commissioner Davis said investigators also have found a circuit board with a wire slotted through it at the bombing scene on Boylston Street and the area had been swept clean of explosives. Menino said that area is still under the control of the FBI, but will be released to the city soon and a five-phase restoration is planned.
Hundreds of FBI agents and other investigators have interviewed more than 100 people who knew the brothers, the source said. They are looking for any possible links to foreign extremists and seeking to understand how the plot developed and if anyone helped them, the source said.
He confirmed that Tamerlan Tsarnaev had video of a known jihadist on his YouTube channel, footage the source had viewed and characterized as ""extremely inflammatory.""
Menino had said earlier it has become clear that the older brother, Tamerlan, was the more influential, describing him as the ""leader"" and Dzhokhar as a ""follower.""
The older brother ""read those magazines that are published on how to create bombs,"" Menino said.
Investigators are also tracking the brothers' online activities, phone calls and text messages, examining hundreds of pieces of evidence -- including bomb components, unexploded devices as well as the brothers' vehicles, guns, and financial records seized from various sites across Boston and surrounding suburbs, authorities said.
The blasts set off near the finish line of the marathon killed three people and injured more than 180.
Sunday morning, Davis said on the CBS News show, ""Face the Nation"" that the crime scene from the early Friday morning firefight in Watertown that killed Tamerlan Tsarnaev was ""littered"" with unexploded improvised explosive devices.
Davis said it's his belief that the brothers were ""going to attack other individuals"" -- and Davis said that's based on the evidence at the scene and the firepower that the brothers had.
Two men with connections to the brothers were taken into custody Saturday in New Bedford, Mass., and eventually arrested and detained on immigration violations by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, that agency announced.
The source said those arrests were made in an abundance of caution because the men were friends and former roommates of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and had regular contact with him. Officials want to question them at greater length about whether they knew anything about the brothers' plans or provided any help to them.
Sunday morning, Boston Cardinal Sean O'Malley implored hundreds of parishioners at a Mass at the Cathedral of the Holy Cross to forgive the suspected Boston Marathon bombers and seize on the goodwill born of the tragedy.
""We must be people of reconciliation -- not revenge,"" he told about 800 parishioners during a service that honored four killed in last week's marathon bombings and their aftermath. Candles lighted an altar with photos of the dead victims, including the three killed Monday in the bombing, and a police officer killed Friday in a shootout.
Speaking to reporters after the service, O'Malley reiterated the church's opposition to the death penalty. ""Forgiveness does not mean that we do not realize the heinousness of the crime. But in our hearts, when we are unable to forgive, we make ourselves a victim of our hatred. Forgiveness is part of our obligation of disciples of the Lord.""
Also Sunday, Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick said on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" that video footage clearly shows Dzhokhar Tsarnaev placing a backpack near the marathon finish line.
Patrick said it's hard to imagine why someone would deliberately harm ""innocent men, women and children in the way that these two fellows did.""
The FBI had disclosed this past week that it had questioned Tamerlan Tsarnaev in 2011 regarding possible terrorist connections, but found nothing and took no action against him.
Sen. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Sunday he understood that the FBI didn't find any troubling evidence during its initial contact with the suspect in 2011 -- prompted by concerns passed along by Russian authorities -- but he noted that was before Tamerlan Tsarnaev made a suspicious overseas trip.
""Then he went to Russia and he came back and almost immediately put very radical things on his website,"" Schumer said of the elder Boston bombing suspect. ""Why didn't the FBI, having known that he was someone a foreign government at least thought might be dangerous, go interview him again?""
Schumer, speaking during an unrelated news conference, said that the federal death penalty law he helped co-author in the 1990s would be ""appropriate"" in the case of the surviving suspect.
On Saturday, Rep. Peter King (R-Seaford) had also questioned the FBI's actions.
Meanwhile, rebels in Russia's North Caucasus region denied any link to the April 15 attack on the Boston Marathon in a statement posted on the vdagestan.com website.
""The Caucasian Mujahedeen are not fighting with the United States of America,"" according to the statement, which was attributed to unidentified Mujahedeen commanders in Dagestan. ""We are at war with Russia, which is responsible not only for the occupation of the Caucasus, but also for heinous crimes against Muslims.""
An FBI-led probe is looking into a six-month trip suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev, an immigrant of Chechen descent, took around two years ago to Chechnya and neighboring Dagestan, both regions of Russia that have been embroiled in Islamist separatist movements.
In Medford, Mass., bombing victim Krystle Campbell was eulogized Monday after a funeral procession from the funeral home where she was waked to St. Joseph Roman Catholic Church. Services concluded with burial at Oak Grove Cemetery.
The Associated Press reported that doctors said the Boston transit police officer wounded in a shootout with the bombing suspects had lost nearly all his blood and his heart had stopped from a single gunshot wound that severed three major blood vessels in his right thigh.
Surgeons at Mount Auburn Hospital in Cambridge say Richard Donohue, 33, is in stable but critical condition. He is sedated and on a breathing machine but opened his eyes, moved his hands and feet, and squeezed his wife's hand Sunday.
Emergency workers started CPR on the scene to restart his heart. Doctors say he is expected to make a full recovery and that nerves and muscles in his leg are intact.
Transit officials say Donohue had gotten out of his cruiser and was shooting at the suspects when he was hit late Thursday night in a gun battle in Cambridge.
""He went in there and engaged people who were shooting at his fellow officers,"" Donohue's brother, Edward, said at a news conference Sunday at the hospital. ""I cannot describe the pride I have,"" said the younger Donohue, who is a patrolman for the Winchester Police Department.
The fellow officers included a friend, MIT police officer Sean Collier, who authorities say was shot to death at the beginning of the brothers' rampage earlier in the night.
Richard Donohue has been a transit officer for three years, said Paul MacMillan, chief of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority.
The University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth, where Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was a student, reopened Sunday at noon, university officials announced on the school's website.",en,web

"While public health authorities invariably contend that “vaccines are safe” and “vaccines save lives”, it is impossible for them to prove these statements.

Human biology is complex, and we all have a tendency to counterbalance ""good"" lifestyle choices with less-helpful ones.
But as we have learned from '5 a Day', you can't succeed in tackling childhood obesity by promoting the benefits of vegetables alone – we have to enable families to make a broader sweep of changes in a way that suits them and the way they live.
Has it made a difference? Yes it has. While too many of our children are still overweight or obese, the most recent National Diet and Nutrition Survey shows that children’s sugar consumption from ages four to 10 has been steadily decreasing since 2013.
Similarly, we have seen a notable decrease in the purchase of sugary cereals and drinks as a result of Change4Life’s 2016 'Sugar Smart' campaign as well as a reduction of high sugar, fat and salt products being purchased, according to shopping basket data from the 2017 'Be Food Smart' campaign.

"Last year I was presenting SimpliField to retail leaders at our first NRF New York Big Retail Show.Seems like our solution has found its way as we begin 2017 with a great new partnership with Salesforce!
More than a quality proof, this partnership represents a real added value for our clients: Within few clicks in their salesforce environment, they can integrate SimpliField and monitor their Retail Execution easily. Data (like PoS profiles, users, KPIs) is automaticaly syncronized and managers get access to a ready to use and customised dashboards.
The NRF New York Big Retail Show was also an appealing opportunity to discuss new retail challenges.
Data is still a goldmine for retailers and wholesalers, but the main issue is how to harness its potential? Moreover, how data can better serve workforce, who is the number one retailers concern?
Sales teams are brand ambassadors on the field, and their managers are ready to invest more and more in data collection and technologies to help them perfect the customer experience in-store. As matter of fact, 90% of purchase still happen in Brick and Mortar stores.
For Brian Krzanich, CEO of Intel, data is the new oil to build the “store of the future“. It will give retailers insights on customer interests, and help better managing stores execution and inventory.
By 2017, digital natives will become the largest spending population with $200 billion in annual spend. Thanks to Carrie Ask, this new generation of consumers “don’t have to go to stores”. They’re use to buy online and feel completely confortable about it.
To drive them to store, retailers must offer them an innovative in-store experience, and motive them to come have a look. No retailer can ignore those potential clients, and physical stores must provide digital services like mobile check-out, or pick up in-store, at least.
We heard it several time again this year, omnichannel strategy is the key focus to succeed in the retail landscape. Conversionnal commerce and dynamic pricing (with AI bots) are totally moving in this direction. Those solutions allow a complete personnalisation of customer journey in stores and add value to both brand image and figures.
More than consumers behavior and product retailers offer, service remains on top of preoccupations. Better service means recruiting and retaining talented sales team. But also train them to represent brand’ culture and make retail more human.
Like SimpliField, 9 French start up were part of “La French Tech”, their innovatives B2B products like connected screen, web-to-store solution, marketplace editor or customers web forum will enhance 2017 omnichannel shopping experience for sure.

"Primož Roglič, who came 2nd in today's Men Elite Individual Time Trial.
This week, the UCI Road World Championships 2017 are taking place here in Bergen, Norway. The city has really come to life, and the streets are filled with happy people, flags, and bicycles. The atmosphere is amazing, and I am so proud of my city for pulling this off. Most of the city center has been completely closed to traffic, and people are walking everywhere.
Even though this kind of sport photography is about as far from night photography as one can get, I decided to give it a try. Keeping in mind that I don't have a decent lens for this kind of photography, and that I've never done it before, I'm quite happy with the results. Not too shabby for a first-timer?
They went by so quickly, so not all of the photos are completely in focus, but look at those faces - they are so focused on what they are doing.",en,web

"Japan's economy shrank 0.6 per cent in the July-to-September quarter, the government said Thursday, in a sign the country's rebound from a lengthy slowdown is stalling.
The gross domestic product data were revised from a preliminary announcement in December of 0.2 per cent growth, handing the world's second largest economy its first quarter of contraction since October-to-December of 1999.
The Cabinet Office's announcement raises concerns that Japan may not meet its target for 1.2 per cent growth this fiscal year -- which could prove troubling for embattled Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori, who has promised to usher in an era of growth.
But Eiji Kawade, vice minister of the Cabinet Office, said the government stands by its growth estimates for this year.
""When we made the forecasts...we factored in"" the possibility of slower growth, Kawade said.
Mori, whose approval ratings have dropped to 14 per cent, is already under pressure from recent scandals that have shaken public support for his government. Thursday's figures show Japan has not managed to pull out of its deepest economic slump in decades and throw into question Mori's ability to lead a turnaround.
Hit by concerns over the economy, Japanese stocks tumbled Thursday to their lowest level this year.
The benchmark Nikkei 225 average finished Thursday's trading down 227.78 points, or 1.70 per cent, to 13,138.23.
The revisions, the largest made to GDP figures since 1978, indicate that corporate Japan is not making a significant contribution to getting the economy back on track.
Business investment increased 1.5 per cent in the July-to-September quarter from the previous one � far weaker than the 7.8 per cent growth in the preliminary data. The slower growth suggests that corporations, a driving force of the economy, are not investing in new equipment and machinery as aggressively as economists had believed.
President Bush transmitted the blueprint for his $1.6 trillion, 10-year tax relief package to Congress on Thursday, fulfilling a major presidential campaign promise three weeks into his term.
Bush, in the first Rose Garden ceremony of his nascent presidency, signed two bound documents containing the parameters for a tax-cut bill that will have to be written in the House of Representatives over the next few weeks.
Bush said signs of a slowing economy are becoming more obvious by the day, and he is betting his tax cut package will boost sagging prospects for wage earners and business owners.
""We need tax relief now -- in fact, we needed tax relief � and I will work with Congress to provide it,"" Bush told a gathering of Hispanic business leaders who observed the signing ceremony.
The expected arrival of the documents at the Capitol, on their way up Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House at late morning, allowed the leaders of the Democratic minorities in the House and the Senate to begin their maneuvering against the soon-to-be-written tax bill.
The documents were handed over by Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill to Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Mississippi, and House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Illinois, just before noon, and just after the Democrats stepped forward to launch their counteroffensive.
House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt of Missouri and Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota told reporters the Bush plan is based on economic projections that could crumble, and they warned the nation should not be locked into a 10-year commitment that cannot be reversed.
""We cannot count on the economic forecasts that the Republicans rely on to hold up 10 years from now,"" Gephardt said. ""No family, no business would act in this manner, and we shouldn't either.""
The Bank of England cut interest rates to 5.75 per cent on Thursday, as expected, its first reduction in 20-months.
The U.S. Federal Reserve cut interest rates by one per centage point in January to counter fears of recession in the world's biggest economy. The BoE is concerned a U.S. slowdown could impact the UK economy.
The BoE is ""worried that European growth has been affected by a slowdown in the U.S.,"" Vicky Pryce, an economist at KPMG, told CNN before the rate cut. ""There is more evidence that the UK is slowing, and the bank will respond.""
The UK economy has enjoyed an unprecedented period of stability recently, with the BoE able to resist tweaking monetary policy for almost two years.
The cut in interest rates pushed some mortgage lenders to lower their rates for borrowers. Halifax, the UK's biggest mortgage lender, cut is variable mortgage interest rate by 0.24 per centage points to 7.50 per cent.
The Russian Finance Ministry has prepared an anti-money laundering bill that will impose stricter monitoring of financial transactions, a Russian daily newspaper reported on Monday.
Kommersant published a copy of the draft law, which would give the government the right to monitor all operations that could possibly be used in a money laundering scheme. The monitoring bill includes most forms of cash transactions, anonymous accounts, money and securities transfers involving dubious offshore centres as well as property dealings, suspicious loans, lotteries and other activities.
If passed, it will oblige all institutions through which such operations are carried out to keep strict records and automatically report them to a special body set up by the Interior Ministry.
Japanese stocks plunged to a 28-month low on Thursday, after data suggested the economy may be heading for another recession.

"Aflatoxins are a family of toxic and carcinogenic secondary metabolites produced by five Aspergillus species from section Flavi: A. flavus, A. parasiticus, A. nomius, A. pseudotamarii and A. bombycis. Aspergillus flavus and A. parasiticus are the most extensively studied species because of their agricultural and medical importance. Soil is the primary reservoir for A. flavus and A. parasiticus and they are frequently isolated from tropical and subtropical latitudes where they commonly infect peanut, corn, cottonseed and tree nuts. Both species have affinities for oilseeds but differ in the types of aflatoxins produced.
While both A. flavus and A. parasiticus produce the B aflatoxins (B1 and B2), A. parasiticus also produces the G aflatoxins (G1 and G2), and is more frequently associated with peanuts than with cottonseed and corn. Because of their high toxicity to humans and animals, federally and internationally mandated laws require the destruction or decontamination of the crop when the aflatoxin content exceeds 15 µg/kg, resulting in huge yield losses worldwide. The degree of economic loss is worse under heat and drought conditions, which favor soil invasion and fungal growth. Under these stress conditions, the contamination of peanuts, cottonseed and corn with A. flavus and A. parasiticus can be quite extensive and maintaining these agricultural commodities becomes a significant challenge.",en,academic
"TOP 5 TIPS TO MANAGE STRESSFUL CONVERSATIONS – Educate the body. Exercise the mind.
Recognize your fearful feeling is present for a reason. Identify the sense of loss to determine if it is realistic or not. (Loss of: job, approval of others, property, money, respect, being right, favorable condition.) Know what triggered your reaction.
Know your fear is manageable with a shift in perception. Fear creates a protective response from your nervous system, to guard against actual threats, real or imagined. Is it danger, or just a trigger of an old fear?
Pause and reflect. Did the content trigger your reaction, or that of the person you are communicating with? Are you or the other party) feeling offended, confused, angry, hurt, threatened, embarrassed, vulnerable, or diminished by something they did or said?
Shift the energy: ask questions, stop to think, identify the trigger, acknowledge how you or they felt, and apologize for any mistakes.
Practice pausing and adjust your words during stressful conversations to redirect the energy for a better outcome. Take a deep breath of power create a more positive atmosphere for optimal communication.",en,reference

"The term “blogging” started out as a slang term for “Web Logging”, the practice of keeping a public log of comments about interesting websites. It started back in the early days of the Web, before search engines were widely available. The first web logs were just web pages created by hand, like all other pages back in that era; but as the web took off in the late 1990’s, software tools appeared to let non-technical people create and maintain web logs of their own. Around the turn of the millennium, references to web logs started showing up in other media, and the term “blogging”, which began as slang, became the standard word. Someone who maintains a blog is called a “blogger” and the collection of all blogs is commonly known as “the blogosphere”.
Blogging is about a lot more than just commenting on websites now, isn’t it?
That’s right. Blogs are now used for all sorts of things, most commonly personal online journals, technical newsletters, or political discussions. Often they do include links to other websites, and comments about them, but this is no longer required. Blog entries are just as likely to refer to items in the news, or developments in the technical world, or events in the blogger’s life, or whatever else the blogger feels like writing about.
Why would i want to know about blogs now?
Blogs are an important means of communication these days. For years now, the Web has been too vast for any one person to find everything they are interested in, but blogs can be useful “filters” that help people find sites they would not have otherwise known about. Despite the claims of some, blogs have not yet rendered traditional media obsolete, but they still provide a lot of useful information and commentary on things the more traditional media might miss, or provide a place for different opinions to be expressed freely.
More to the point, WOU is in the process of setting up a blog server of our own, using the Movable Type system. Any member of the WOU community will be able to set up a blog, free of charge. The specifics will be covered in a later FAQ. If you have anything you want to talk about, a blog is easier to set up than a personal web page. Also, blogs can be very useful in a classroom setting, facilitating communication and discussion. See below for more on this.
The exact definition of “blog” is open for debate. Most people agree that the key feature of a blog is that it has dated entries, like a diary or journal. The most recent entry is visible first and previous entries are available lower on the page or in archives; any entry can be bookmarked or linked to individually. Virtually all blogs include a sidebar of links to other sites (mainly other blogs.) Most blogging software also allows readers to post comments on blog entries, and several programs also have a “trackback” feature that allows readers to see what other blogs have linked to the entry they are currently reading. Some make a distinction between a “weblog” in which every entry contains a link, and a “journal” which is more free-form, though for most people, the term “blog” covers both.
what are some common types of blogs?
As already mentioned, the three most common types of blogs are personal, technical, and political. Many blogs cross these boundaries, of course, but the three categories remain fairly distinct, with common features shared among blogs of the same type.
Another way to categorize blogs is by the contributors. Most blogs are run by a single individual, who may or may not allow other users to comment; examples might be a class blog run by a professor, or a personal online journal, or a blog dedicated to political commentary by one person. Many blogs are are run by groups of people, sharing the responsibility for keeping the blog updated. Others, known as community blogs, are open to anyone, sometimes for a fee. Still others are official publications of companies or other organizations.
what’s the difference between a blog and forum?
The main difference between a blog and a forum is that most blogs maintain a distinction between the blogger and the readers, while in a forum, anyone who is a member may post. Forums are also designed to maintain many different discussions at once, while blogs are more linear, in that they are date-based. The distinction blurs a bit when a blog allows readers to comment, or when a forum only allows a few people to post but many people to read. Of course there are also many technical differences, but I won’t get into that here.
how much should i trust what i read in a blog?
Good question! Since blogs are most often written by individuals, they are subject to the mistakes and biases of those people. As with any web page (or any piece of information at all, really,) you need to consider the source. If the blogger is someone you know, such as a friend or one of your professors, trust is easy to judge. Most bloggers will not be known to you, of course; in general, they do mean well, though they are of course still human, and fallible. A few bloggers actually tell outright lies or intentionally distort their sources to fit some agenda. Even if someone is trying to be honest, they still might fall prey to false information; it is easy for a rumor to start somewhere in the blogosphere and spread like wildfire with little or no fact checking. Naturally this is not unique to blogs or even the Internet, since gossip has been with us for thousands of years; blogs just allow it to spread faster. On the other hand, blogs can also spread truths that other sources have missed or ignored.
With all this, it isn’t easy to know how much to trust anything in a blog. The best way I’ve found is to read a wide variety of blogs, as well as other news sources, and compare them. If a story only appears on blogs of a certain bias, take it with a larger grain of salt than normal. It’s also crucial to consider the track record of the people involved. Have they exaggerated before? How much and what kind of documentation do they provide? Just like anything you hear from anywhere else, you have to weigh different factors before deciding how much to trust something on a blog, and whether it is worth passing along.
I’m a professor. What if I want to start a blog for my class?
Dr. Shaun Huston of the Geography department recently gave a presentation on effective use of blogs in a classroom setting. If you missed it, you can contact him at hustons@wou.edu. Dr. Huston has also written a paper (co-authored by Anne-Marie Deitering of OSU) on the use of blogs for teaching and learning; you may view it on the Web at http://www.rapidintellect.com/AEQweb/5mar2879z4.htm.

"That’s why I fear the much-celebrated “sharing economy” — the catch-all name for “peer-to-peer” firms, many based in California, that connect people for the purposes of distributing, sharing, and reusing goods and services — is likely to produce more fights than profits. And to embroil our state in political, legal, commercial and environmental battles related to sharing.
I hope I’m wrong about this. Companies such as the ride-sharing services Lyft and Uber and the apartment-sharing service Airbnb are California success stories. Sharing services can eliminate waste, improve efficiency, connect people to one another and allow us to make money on extra stuff in our closets and garages.
If that’s all the sharing economy promised to do, I’d have no reason to worry. But the sharing economy is more than a business sector — it’s a movement, with the grandest of ambitions for our politics, culture and environment.
Over a couple of months of reading about and talking to people in the sharing economy, I’ve been struck by the limitless ambitions of its participants and proponents. Here are just a few: reversing economic inequality, stopping ecological destruction, countering materialism and capitalism, enhancing worker rights, empowering the poor, and reimagining our politics.
It would be easy to dismiss this as just more of the self-aggrandizing, self-righteous nonsense for which liberal pockets of California are well known. Except that the sharing economy is already threatening to reach into every corner of our lives, from food to photography, education to finance. If that sounds like an exaggeration, consider this: Venture capitalists just funded an app to help you find someone to do your laundry for you.
In this context, my bid to watch your dog while you’re on vacation — and yours to drive me to the airport — are at once freeing and full of dangers. Who’s responsible if your dog bites my kid while in my care? What kind of car insurance, training and licensing do you need to shuttle me safely? What, if anything, do we owe to the kennel workers and cabbies who lose work? And who governs all of this?
There are so many potential conflicts — professional, political, commercial, geographic, generational — posed by sharing that I couldn’t list them here. To pick just one more: Sharing is a threat to the general plans of virtually every city. After all, what is Airbnb if not a rezoning of residential areas into hotel space?
Whether being used by the environmental left or the anti-spending right, “sustainability” has become a vague if powerful way of dismissing somebody else’s idea without having to reckon with the particulars. “That’s unsustainable,” means it can’t go on, so why continue to discuss? It’s how we say no to anything new that might cost money or consume energy. So, naturally, almost every government or corporate bureaucracy you encounter in California has an office of sustainability.
What California doesn’t have is the governance infrastructure to host the multi-front battles over sharing and sustainability that are on the horizon. Our weak local governments, crowded and underfunded courts, and broken political system simply aren’t up to handling all the new planning, zoning, licensing, regulatory, and democratic questions posed by all this sharing.
For all its promise, the sharing economy threatens to turn virtually every aspect of living into contested ground. And that’s no way to live.",en,reference

"Although Maxfield Parrish took many photographs for his illustration work, he also, on occasion, took snapshots of his family. While searching through the 83 boxes of the Papers of Maxfield Parrish at Dartmouth’s Rauner Special Collections, I found this lovely portrait of MP’s family in an old family album. Lydia seems to be seating toddler Jean next to her brothers, and Jean’s giving Daddy a look that makes it clear she is none too happy with the situation. The boys are, from left, Dillwyn, Steve, and Max Jr. Judging by the dirt on their knees and their exhausted faces, it seems the boys have been doing some serious playing. Lydia here is almost forty, and her hair seems to be starting to turn gray. The late afternoon sun is sinking just behind them.
The above image is from a glass negative, and the quality of the color is astounding, considering the photograph was taken around 1913. Lydia, looking pensive, sits next to Jean, who’s a bit older here. They’re holding hollyhock blooms.",en,books

"One of the great romances throughout all of Marvel Comics history is the one shared between the Scarlet Witch and the Vision. After first serving together as Avengers, Wanda Maximoff and the synthezoid created by Ultron became an item and eventually married. Then they had twin boys named Tommy and Billy, who grow up to be members of the Young Avengers. But when it comes to the Marvel Cinematic Universe versions of the characters, it’s uncertain whether we’ll see the two find a love connection in ‘Captain America: Civil War’, especially since they’re on opposing sides of this fight. Though it could happen, Elizabeth Olsen puts their relationship in different terms.
That’s a really interesting angle that I never really considered for the movies. It will definitely be cool to see how these two will deal with essentially “being born” from the Mind Stone. But again, as they are on opposing sides of this looming confrontation between Captain America and Iron Man, it probably won’t be something that’s heavily addressed until later on. Either way, I look forward to see how this element of the story develops as Phase Three progresses.
What do you think about Scarlet Witch and The Vision’s relationship in the Marvel Cinematic Universe? Do you think that a romantic relationship will develop just as it did in the comics? Or do you feel like ‘Captain America: Civil War’ is the start of a whole different direction for these two characters that we haven’t seen before?

"This seemed to be much closer than any other meteor I’ve witnessed in my lifetime and would like to learn more about it and others.
To be more detailed from earlier, I was standing on the edge of my garage sidewalk. It was amazing to see this sight. If someone was to visit and view from my point of view, It flew what seemed like a few feet above the tree line but I know it was much further away. It was constant white and seemed to be falling from right to left. It started bright white and tapered into blue. It’s the second flash I’ve seen in less than a month. The last time I saw one, I was driving North on I 83 just before the PA/MD border and it was dropping from the sky NW from my location. This is fascinating to me and I’m happy to be able to report it to you.
I believe it fragmented as it turned from white to blue. It seemed to get bigger if that makes sense.",en,books

"We all know how important vegetables are to our diet. We also know how fussy kids can be when asked to eat vegetables. 🙂 The trick is to get them started off on vegetables as early as possible. I started adding mashed vegetables in Devansh’s food approximately a month after he had started eating solids properly. Mashed Vegetables for Baby Food is a real time saver. So I think this recipe will come handy when you are preparing food for seven month or older babies.
I make a mixture of some common vegetables like carrots and peas to last me for 3-4 days. I then add some new vegetable to it when I cook the main dish. I add the mashed vegetables to practically every dish Devansh eats—khichdis, poha, dalia…you name it. 🙂 Make mashed vegetables for baby food in bulk; trust me, it proves to be a real time saver while preparing babies’ and toddlers’ meals.
Make these mashed vegetables for baby food in bulk and store it to use in your kids' daily food such as khichdis, poha, dalia, upma…you name it.
Wash the vegetables thoroughly to remove any trace of pesticide. I usually soak the vegetables in water with some Tollyjoy or Mee Mee Vegetable Liquid Cleanser added to it for about 5 minutes. Then I wash the vegetables thoroughly with water.
Cut the tomato in 4 pieces.
Chop the vegetables other than the green peas finely.
Cook the vegetables in a pressure cooker on medium flame for about 10-15 minutes (5-6 whistles).
Peel the tomatoes and green peas. If your kid is old enough to chew food properly, you can leave the peels on. You can omit this and the next step if you would like to use a blender to make a fine paste of the cooked vegetables.
Mash the vegetables using a masher. For older babies, mash the vegetables coarsely as you want them to gradually learn how to chew food.
Store the mashed vegetables in an airtight container like Tupperware after the mixture cools down. Please freeze this mixture instead of just refrigerating it.",en,reference

SPUR, the Marblehead-based community service non-profit, will provide backpacks filled with school supplies and snacks for about 600 children in Marblehead, Swampscott, Salem, and Lynn.
People and businesses are invited to make a donation, which is used to purchase backpacks and supplies. Donations will be accepted through August 18. Then, volunteers will spend three days assembling the backpacks. Last year, 322 people donated to the drive and more than 130 volunteers stuffed the backpacks.
Names of children in need are sent to SPUR by area school counselors, food pantry directors, social workers, and homeless education liaisons.
“For the 70 school-aged children and their families who use the Marblehead Food Pantry, this backpack is the most important and gratifying gift that they receive through the year,” said Janet Parker, director of the Marblehead Food Pantry.
“The cost of required supplies is out of the price range for our clients and being able to go to school with a new backpack and quality supplies like everyone else helps instill a sense of inclusion in the school community,” she added.
At Salem Academy, adjustment counselor Sarah Roy says many parents struggle just to provide basic food and shelter for their kids.
Rebecca Hayes of Swampscott helped launch the SPUR backpack drive three years ago. She and her daughters (entering 2nd and 4th grade) are excited to be involved again this year.
“According to my girls, the backpack drive is important to ‘build community’ and ‘help our friends have all the things they need for school, too,’” Hayes reported after chatting with her daughters about the project while on vacation.
For many donors and volunteers, the favorite part of the SPUR drive is attaching a personal note to each backpack.

"COEUR D’ALENE, Idaho, Aug. 02, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — New Jersey Mining Company (OTCQB:NJMC) (“NJMC” or the “Company”) announced today that it has closed a private financing and will use the funds to resume underground production at its Golden Chest Mine project near Murray, Idaho.
NJMC closed a private placement through GVC Capital LLC, whereby accredited investors have forward purchased 904 ounces of .999 gold at $935 per ounce, to be delivered or converted to cash at the investor’s option starting December 1, 2016 and quarterly thereafter, over two years as gold is produced from the Golden Chest Mine and New Jersey Mill. In combination with the previously announced subscription by Company management (through Ophir Holdings LLC) for 500 ounces of gold on the same terms, NJMC has sold forward 1,404 ounces of gold at its anticipated per ounce cost of production for total proceeds of $1,312,740.
The mine plan has a 3,000-tonne per month production target with all material to be processed at the Company’s nearby New Jersey Mill. The mine plan is focused on the main Skookum Shoot orebody which remains open down-dip with substantial exploration potential in other areas including up-dip and on-strike extensions.
Company management believes the Golden Chest property has district-scale production potential for the longer term, not only near the recently constructed mine, but in areas of past exploration and historic production. A compilation study recently integrated all available modern exploration data from the property and across the Murray area. This includes work by Cominco, Newmont, NJMC, Golden Chest LLC, and recent mine lessee Juniper Resources LLC.
NJMC recently announced that it is set to begin small-scale open-pit mining operations at the Golden Chest from a starter pit containing an estimated 13,000 tonnes of mineralized material with excellent potential for expansion. Open-pit mining this summer and fall is expected to generate cash flow while the underground mine workings are dewatered. See the NJMC news release dated June 21, 2016 for more details.

Bonnie, that's so funny about sleeping on the steps. Sounds like something my cat would do.
Pretty quilt that your friend made.
I'm going to steal that idea for a quilt. What a great way to stretch the string blocks and it looks really great too!

"We've seen enough carnage on Black Friday to know just how excited humanity can get over a bargain, so I hesitate to even share this. I need us all to briefly find our chill and hold on tight. Now that your tray table is locked and your chair in the upright position, you should know that you could own the Center Lovell Inn Maine for a killer 200-word essay and $125. It may sound like a trick, but it's real. You better all get over your writer's block real quick, because an essay submission like that could be your one-way ticket to becoming half as cool as our unmatched inn-keeping heroine, aka Lorelai Gilmore.
The 210-year-old inn is nestled in Western Maine, in full view of the White Mountains, and is worth nearly a million dollars. Its owner, 68-year-old Janice Sage, said the inspiration for the contest was simple enough: It was the very same way that she acquired the inn back in 1993 from its previous owners.
""I’ve never been known to do anything the normal way. I just want to pass it on for someone else,"" she said in a statement to the Press Herald.
In order to break even on the inn, Janice is hoping to collect at least 7,500 contest entries, which would be the monetary equivalent of the inn's estimated worth. She'll read every entry herself, and then hand over the top twenty to two unnamed judges. Whoever is deemed the most fit to own and operate the inn will not only win it, but everything on the inside of it as well.
The pressure is on, guys. I'm betting a lot of people who have $125 to spare and enough words rattling around in their brains are going to make this a stiff competition. And I don't mean to intimidate anyone, because I want this to be a fair fight and all, but you probably shouldn't bother. I'm going to win. I'll even let you see my note in advance, because I'm that confident.
Don't feel bad, guys. You gave it your best shot!!",en,web

"Is canvassing an effective way to do outreach?
Most Christians express a strong hesitancy over the prospect of canvassing in their community. They ask, “Does it really work? How will people going to respond? How will it impact my church?” The underlying factor behind all of these questions is that Christians are fearful – even horrified — about sharing their faith with strangers.
This post begins a five-part series that addresses commonly-asked questions and misconceptions about canvassing as an effective tool for outreach.
Praise and Proclaim Ministries conducts outreach campaigns throughout the U.S. Our ministry trains Christians on how to boldly and confidently share the gospel of Jesus Christ by teaching a simple methodology. We provide a well-organized and immediate opportunity for Christians to put their training into action by going door-to-door to proclaim the gospel. This experience enables a Christian to conquer their fears and realize that the emphasis of evangelism is not on ourselves, but trusting in the power of the gospel and the promises from Christ.
Many Christians have told me, “Our church has already tried going door-to-door and it doesn’t work!” One pastor confided to me, “Canvassing is scary and takes a lot of work. But after you are done, you are always glad that you did it.” Another pastor shared, “I understand that going door-to-door is one way of sharing the gospel, but I just don’t like to do that.” The effectiveness of canvassing is mostly judged by poor experiences, low participation, great efforts with little fruit, or the ongoing battle with the fear of evangelism. It is my experience that methodology, training, organization, and the amount of preparation for the campaign are huge factors in having a successful outreach campaign that includes door-to-door canvassing.
The pastor is primarily responsible for organizing the campaign.
The pastor is solely responsible for carrying out all of the follow-up visits and contacts.
The people are not well-trained and do not know what to say or do at the door.
There is an inadequate follow-up system.
An outreach campaign that involves canvassing requires an extensive amount of energy. The pastor cannot do it all himself, nor should he. Too often, when all of the energy is placed on the actual event, a congregation will forget that the most important activity for a successful door-to-door campaign is what happens afterwards. Consistent and meaningful follow-up is a critical component for any door-to-door campaign to be effective and most congregations have not prepared themselves for this ongoing work. Potential fruit is left hanging on the branch when congregations either exhaust themselves or too disorganized to follow through.
Therefore, judging the success or the effectiveness of a door-to-door campaign really depends upon setting the right goals and expectations. When congregations focus their attention on activities that they can control, namely, providing structure for a positive experience, the Lord will take care of the rest.
The methodology of canvassing can also include hanging plastic bags of information on people’s door. This is an effective way to advertise or invite people to a church-sponsored event. It can also be a way for a person to read a short gospel message.
I believe there is power in the verbal proclamation of the gospel that provides a transforming experience for the Christian. In the strictest sense, whenever the New Testaments utilizes the word “evangelism” it means a verbal proclamation of the Good News. When a believer steps out in faith to verbally share their faith, they are exercising spiritual muscles by “working out their salvation with fear and trembling.” (Phil. 2:12) In doing so, they are experiencing the power and the presence of the Holy Spirit through the proclamation of his Word. It is the proclamation of the gospel that makes canvassing a meaningful experience and completely changes the dynamic of an outreach campaign. This transforming experience is what inspires a Spirit-filled zeal to continue to do outreach, to make follow-up visits, and to actively assist the pastor in organizing future efforts to confidently and boldly share the gospel. Witnessing no longer becomes a scary prospect that all Christians feel prone to do, but a joyful event to look forward to.
When an outreach campaign is focused on proclaiming the gospel, the goals and expectations change. They centered on the number of times the Lord opens doors to proclaim the gospel and trust that the Lord of the Harvest will bring lost souls to faith as a result of the gospel seeds being planted. These are goals and expectations that Christians can control instead of the number of people who come to church. This change in perspective not only provides a meaningful experience, but also prompts congregation members to actively continue their efforts to reach the lost.
In today’s culture, churches must build bridges with the community and introduce themselves as a living, caring, active, and growing family of believers. The best way to connect and engage with people is by providing a face for your church. A Christian is not only representing their church, but they are also serving as an ambassador for Christ to deliver an all-important message with eternal consequences. Congregations need to find ways to step outside of their comfort zones to engage and connect with people who are struggling, hurting, and looking for answers.
A well-organized effort with solid training and focus on proclaiming the message of what Christ has already done for us on the cross Christ with strangers can be an effective way to build confidence and receive the joy of being God’s messengers.
Thank you for the reblog! Pray that this message will be a blessing for your readers.
This methodology is a game-changer for canvassers. I have a new perspective on witnessing after being trained in this method. Rather than worrying about having a response to convince people, I focus on what God says.",en,web

CoralPoker.com (= EuroBetPoker.com) – Coral mobile sports betting has taken off but its poker business has always come second.
Hollywood Poker – not much evidence of interest in going mobile over at Hollywood but they’ve got a clock they could surely turn into an app quite quickly!

"Carson, CA –– July 17, 2013 – AutoPartsWarehouse.com today released its list of the Top Ten Most Purchased Auto Parts Online, based on millions of replacement parts purchased by online customers from June 2012 to June 2013. The report indicates that consumers are not balking at ordering hefty items online, like radiators – which captured the #1 spot – while smaller big-ticket items of varying levels of installation difficulty, such as fuel pumps and oxygen sensors, are popular e-commerce items.
Over half of the top ten most ordered parts have a life expectancy of 75K miles or more, while the average online price of the Top 10 was about $80, representing an average savings over retail MSRP of nearly 50%. Five had an installation difficulty rating of moderate or easy.
“Today, consumers are more comfortable ordering parts online, their vehicles are getting older and more are either attempting to do some of their own repairs themselves or are taking parts they have purchased into the repair shop. So it is no surprise to see hundreds of thousands of radiators, shock absorber/strut assemblies and catalytic converters– parts that once were only ever seen at the dealership or repair shop – arriving on consumers’ door steps,” said Shane Evangelist, CEO of AutoPartsWarehouse.com.
Size doesn’t matter: The top selling replacement part, the radiator, is also one of the bulkiest.
High ticket items popular: Four of the top ten average well over $175 retail, with the number one part having the second highest retail MSRP at $420 — and the number three part, Catalytic Converter, having an average retail MSRP of $577.
So are lower cost items: Three of the top ten can be purchased for under $100 MSRP, but purchased online, seven are available for under $100 – with the easy-to-install air filter averaging around $34.
Nearly 50% cost savings: The popularity of high-ticket items not only reflects greater selection and make/model specificity available online, but the possibility of dramatic savings versus an auto parts shop, repair shop or dealership. The number one replacement part has an astonishing average savings of 73% versus its retail counterpart. And even the lowest cost item offers a 35% savings. Average cost-savings overall online, versus retail, for the top ten is nearly 50%.
Low Life Expectancy = Low Price Point: Some of the lowest priced parts that rank in the Top Ten – air filters, brake disc and brake pad sets – also had the lowest life expectancy/greatest frequency of replacement.
Long Life Parts Dominate: Over half of the top ten most purchased parts have a life expectancy of 75k or more, perhaps a reflection of the growing trend of consumers holding onto their vehicles well past the 150K mark.
According to a recent survey1, consumers report they’re purchasing more auto parts online now than they did three years ago, and that greater availability of ‘How-To’ info, more comfort generally with purchasing online, and older vehicles are driving the surge. The survey also revealed that consumers believe that saving money and the ability to comparison shop are the top benefits of purchasing auto parts online.

"Jack Rasmussen. Boned, 2008. Acrylic and collage, 18x24 inches.

Quincy Jones has started a petition to ask President-elect Obama to appoint a Secretary of the Arts.
While many other countries have had Ministers of Art or Culture for generations, the United States has never created such a position.
Although I am generally opposed to expanding government, we in the arts community need this and the country needs the arts -- now more than ever. If you feel that this is a decision that you can support, then please take a moment to sign this important petition and then pass it on to your friends and colleagues.
My thoughts on some candidates for the position, and my ideas on how to keep a new Department of the Arts from becoming a huge burocratic mess will come later.
The stencilled portrait of President Elect Obama by street artist Shepard Fairey, which became the key image of the Obama election campaign and did wonders for Fairey, has been acquired by the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, DC for its permanent collection.
Of peripheral interest, artist Shepard Fairey has been under a lot of scrutiny in the internets for his alleged violations of intellectual property in lifting imagery and design from Third World artists. Read all about it here. If these allegations are true... well you see where this is heading.
Also, at the risk of being pedantic, it was my understanding that all contemporary portraits in the NPG had to be executed from the live person. In other words, they couldn't be done from a photograph, etc. I will contact the NPG and ask them about this. I am assuming that Fairey did his famous portrait of Obama from an appropriated photograph, rather than have Barack pose for him.
For a couple of years now I have been telling you to acquire Michael Janis' artwork.
From the 1,047 artists from 43 countries sending almost 3,000 images, 100 were selected for publication in New Glass Review, the Corning Museum's annual international publication of glass artists.
The judges were Rachel Berwick, Department Head of Glass, Rhode Island School of Design; Mieke Groot, independent curator, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, and uber glass artist Dante Marioni, from Seattle, Washington, which (as glass freaks know) is the fine arts glass capital of the upper crust of the fine arts world and one of the world's most beautiful cities.
And the DC area's own Michael Janis, from the Washington Glass School, is in that exclusive group in the forthcoming book for 2009.
Death, Tarot Card Series. By Michael Janis. Cast glass, steel, glass powder, 18"" x 36"" x 2""
Artists from the Washington Glass School continue to push the envelope of contemporary glass, and yet their own city's museums seem to be the only ones lagging in spotting them ahead of the rest of the art world.
But for now all that I have to say is ""Congratulations Mike!""
A while back in the mail I got some preview tickets to the opening of the new Steven Soderbergh two-part epic about the life of Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara, the Argentinean blue blood guerrilla leader, starring Puerto Rican actor Benicio Del Toro in the leading role (which has already earned him the coveted Best Actor award at the 2008 at the Cannes Film Festival).
Because I was away on vacation, I couldn't go, but I do plan to see this film, as I have been an avid Guevara follower nearly all my life. Here's a little known Guevara fact: His paternal grandparents, Roberto Guevara and Ana Lynch, were born in California!
My father fought alongside Guevara during the Cuban Revolution, and like most of those brave young men who fought against the Batista dictatorship (both in the mountains of Oriente province and the streets of Havana and Santiago de Cuba) he never expected the Cuban Revolution to institutionalize a worse dictatorship than Batista's bloody regime.
Che was a declared Communist all along, but Communists were rare in the ranks of the rebels.
In fact, to this day most people don't know that the official Cuban Communist Party was part of the Batista government while the Revolution was underway and even Guevara, a Communist all along, had harsh words for the Cuban Communists during the struggle. In 1958 he wrote that there were ""mutual fears"" between the rebels and the Party, and ""fundamentally, the Party of the Workers has not perceived with sufficient clarity the role of the guerrilla.""
After the revolution, Guevara further added that he ""only knew of three Communists who had participated in combat."" Besides himself and Raul Castro, one wonders who the third Communist was (Raul Castro's future wife, Vilma Espin was also a known Communist; however, she was one of the urban guerrillas working under Frank Pais, the anti-Batista leader in the streets of Cuba. Pais was strongly anti-Communist. Of interest, a persistent rumor blames Espin as the traitor responsible for Pais' death at the hands of the Batista police. Fidel Castro himself, always denied being a Communist, until sometime in the early 1960s.
Guevara was a very courageous and even reckless fighter (as opposed to Castro, who spent most of the war secluded in the relative safety of the Sierra Maestra mountains). But Che was also the grim executioner of the Cuban Revolution, a fact that he never hid and even bragged about, but which most Guevara admirers conveniently ignore.
It was Guevara who executed deserters and captured Batista soldiers and henchmen during the struggle; and it was Guevara who signed many of the tens of thousands of execution orders after the Revolution, when Cuba was bathed in blood by avenging firing squads.
See some of the documented Cubans executed by Guevara (including over a dozen shot by Che himself) here or if you have the guts, you can see an actual firing squad in action (broadcast over Cuban TV in 1959).
Because of that, Guevara is known to Cubans as ""El Chacal de La Cabaña.""
""El Chacal de La Cabaña"" translates to the ""Jackal of La Cabaña,"" although it is usually translated as the ""Butcher of La Cabaña.""
La Cabaña is an 18th century fortress complex located on the elevated eastern side of the harbor entrance to Havana, and the location for many of the thousands of firing squad executions which took place after January 1, 1959. Shot were former members of Batista's police, army and air force, informants, traitors, and counter-revolutionaries.
The best known story about this period (which I heard related in a Spanish language radio show in Florida last week) relates to how a Cuban mother went to see Che to beg for her son's life. The son was 17 years old, and was on the firing squad list, to be executed within a week. If Guevara pardoned her son, the mother begged, she would ensure that he never said or did anything against the Revolution.
Che's response was to order the immediate execution of the boy, while the mother was still in his office. His logic: now that the boy was shot, his mother would no longer have to anguish over his fate.
On the other hand, Che's courage as a guerrilla leader and his dedication to his caused are well documented and never challenged and cost him his life.
While Fidel Castro tightened his grip on the Cuban people and replaced the Batista dictatorship with the Castro dictatorship, Guevara put his life at risk fighting in guerrilla wars in Africa and Latin America, until he was caught in the highlands of the Bolivian mountains in 1967 and executed on the spot. Just as he would have done had the situation been reversed.
It is this glowing side of Che's complex character that Che's admirers and apologists always focus upon, and I am looking forward to seeing if this film addresses both the spectacularly courageous side of this iconic figure, as well as his war crimes and dark side of a man with little compassion and remorse.
I am also curious as to how the film handles Guevara's departure from Cuba. ""Che"", claims Dariel Alarcon Ramirez, who joined the rebels in 1956 and then went with Guevara to Bolivia, ""left Cuba after being accused of being a Trotskist and a Maoist.... and because of the problems he had with the Cuban government, specifically Fidel and Raul Castro.""
Once I see the film, I will tell you my thoughts on it. Meanwhile below are the lyrics (translated from the Spanish) from Olafresca's song titled ""El Chacal.""",en,unknown

"It snowed last night...one of those deep white snows that makes everything look like a fairyland, especially when the sun shines and it shone today!!!
We went for a walk just to be out in this wonderful landscape. Well, we weren't the only ones. Along the way, we passed some professional photographers. With cameras the size of Bazookas, lawn chairs and plastic tubs full of bird seeds, they were a winter safari. Now I know how we get those gorgeous bird pictures on calenders.
I didn't actually see them taking pictures, but we came across scatterings of bird seed, so I presumed that the photographers sprinkled bird seed around, sat very still in their lawn chairs and waited for the birds to arrive. With their amazing cameras they could get some lovely close ups. I coveted their gear; but I wouldn't want to carry it around. They had tripods too!!
Well, I am quite content with these pictures taken with my Canon Rebel. I did, however, have to zoom in and crop out the Robin or you would never have seen him.
It was a pretty day, but still very cold. I love days like this, although I am not a great fan of winter. In fact, I am working on a lace scarf as part of a series of seasonal scarves and I have started with Spring - go figure. I am doing it in Lime green - will try to post some pictures soon.

"Madame Speaker, Vice President Biden, Members of Congress, distinguished guests, and fellow Americans:Our Constitution declares that from time to time, the President shall give to Congress information about the state of our union. For two hundred and twenty years, our leaders have fulfilled this duty. They have done so during periods of prosperity and tranquility. And they have done so in the midst of war and depression; at moments of great strife and great struggle.
It’s tempting to look back on these moments and assume that our progress was inevitable – that America was always destined to succeed. But when the Union was turned back at Bull Run and the Allies first landed at Omaha Beach, victory was very much in doubt. When the market crashed on Black Tuesday and civil rights marchers were beaten on Bloody Sunday, the future was anything but certain. These were times that tested the courage of our convictions, and the strength of our union. And despite all our divisions and disagreements; our hesitations and our fears; America prevailed because we chose to move forward as one nation, and one people.
Again, we are tested. And again, we must answer history’s call.
One year ago, I took office amid two wars, an economy rocked by severe recession, a financial system on the verge of collapse, and a government deeply in debt. Experts from across the political spectrum warned that if we did not act, we might face a second depression. So we acted – immediately and aggressively. And one year later, the worst of the storm has passed.
But the devastation remains. One in ten Americans still cannot find work. Many businesses have shuttered. Home values have declined. Small towns and rural communities have been hit especially hard. For those who had already known poverty, life has become that much harder.
This recession has also compounded the burdens that America’s families have been dealing with for decades – the burden of working harder and longer for less; of being unable to save enough to retire or help kids with college.
So I know the anxieties that are out there right now. They’re not new. These struggles are the reason I ran for President. These struggles are what I’ve witnessed for years in places like Elkhart, Indiana and Galesburg, Illinois. I hear about them in the letters that I read each night. The toughest to read are those written by children – asking why they have to move from their home, or when their mom or dad will be able to go back to work.
For these Americans and so many others, change has not come fast enough. Some are frustrated; some are angry. They don’t understand why it seems like bad behavior on Wall Street is rewarded but hard work on Main Street isn’t; or why Washington has been unable or unwilling to solve any of our problems. They are tired of the partisanship and the shouting and the pettiness. They know we can’t afford it. Not now.
So we face big and difficult challenges. And what the American people hope – what they deserve – is for all of us, Democrats and Republicans, to work through our differences; to overcome the numbing weight of our politics. For while the people who sent us here have different backgrounds, different stories and different beliefs, the anxieties they face are the same. The aspirations they hold are shared. A job that pays the bills. A chance to get ahead. Most of all, the ability to give their children a better life.
It is because of this spirit – this great decency and great strength – that I have never been more hopeful about America’s future than I am tonight. Despite our hardships, our union is strong. We do not give up. We do not quit. We do not allow fear or division to break our spirit. In this new decade, it’s time the American people get a government that matches their decency; that embodies their strength.
And tonight, I’d like to talk about how together, we can deliver on that promise.
It begins with our economy.
Our most urgent task upon taking office was to shore up the same banks that helped cause this crisis. It was not easy to do. And if there’s one thing that has unified Democrats and Republicans, it’s that we all hated the bank bailout. I hated it. You hated it. It was about as popular as a root canal.
But when I ran for President, I promised I wouldn’t just do what was popular – I would do what was necessary. And if we had allowed the meltdown of the financial system, unemployment might be double what it is today. More businesses would certainly have closed. More homes would have surely been lost.
So I supported the last administration’s efforts to create the financial rescue program. And when we took the program over, we made it more transparent and accountable. As a result, the markets are now stabilized, and we have recovered most of the money we spent on the banks.
To recover the rest, I have proposed a fee on the biggest banks. I know Wall Street isn’t keen on this idea, but if these firms can afford to hand out big bonuses again, they can afford a modest fee to pay back the taxpayers who rescued them in their time of need.
As we stabilized the financial system, we also took steps to get our economy growing again, save as many jobs as possible, and help Americans who had become unemployed.
That’s why we extended or increased unemployment benefits for more than 18 million Americans; made health insurance 65% cheaper for families who get their coverage through COBRA; and passed 25 different tax cuts.
Let me repeat: we cut taxes. We cut taxes for 95% of working families. We cut taxes for small businesses. We cut taxes for first-time homebuyers. We cut taxes for parents trying to care for their children. We cut taxes for 8 million Americans paying for college. As a result, millions of Americans had more to spend on gas, and food, and other necessities, all of which helped businesses keep more workers. And we haven’t raised income taxes by a single dime on a single person. Not a single dime.
Because of the steps we took, there are about two million Americans working right now who would otherwise be unemployed. 200,000 work in construction and clean energy. 300,000 are teachers and other education workers. Tens of thousands are cops, firefighters, correctional officers, and first responders. And we are on track to add another one and a half million jobs to this total by the end of the year.
The plan that has made all of this possible, from the tax cuts to the jobs, is the Recovery Act. That’s right – the Recovery Act, also known as the Stimulus Bill. Economists on the left and the right say that this bill has helped saved jobs and avert disaster. But you don’t have to take their word for it.
Talk to the small business in Phoenix that will triple its workforce because of the Recovery Act.
Talk to the single teacher raising two kids who was told by her principal in the last week of school that because of the Recovery Act, she wouldn’t be laid off after all.
There are stories like this all across America. And after two years of recession, the economy is growing again. Retirement funds have started to gain back some of their value. Businesses are beginning to invest again, and slowly some are starting to hire again.
But I realize that for every success story, there are other stories, of men and women who wake up with the anguish of not knowing where their next paycheck will come from; who send out resumes week after week and hear nothing in response. That is why jobs must be our number one focus in 2010, and that is why I am calling for a new jobs bill tonight.
Now, the true engine of job creation in this country will always be America’s businesses. But government can create the conditions necessary for businesses to expand and hire more workers.
We should start where most new jobs do – in small businesses, companies that begin when an entrepreneur takes a chance on a dream, or a worker decides its time she became her own boss.
Through sheer grit and determination, these companies have weathered the recession and are ready to grow. But when you talk to small business owners in places like Allentown, Pennsylvania or Elyria, Ohio, you find out that even though banks on Wall Street are lending again, they are mostly lending to bigger companies. But financing remains difficult for small business owners across the country.
So tonight, I’m proposing that we take $30 billion of the money Wall Street banks have repaid and use it to help community banks give small businesses the credit they need to stay afloat. I am also proposing a new small business tax credit – one that will go to over one million small businesses who hire new workers or raise wages. While we’re at it, let’s also eliminate all capital gains taxes on small business investment; and provide a tax incentive for all businesses, large and small, to invest in new plants and equipment.
Next, we can put Americans to work today building the infrastructure of tomorrow. From the first railroads to the interstate highway system, our nation has always been built to compete. There’s no reason Europe or China should have the fastest trains, or the new factories that manufacture clean energy products.
Tomorrow, I’ll visit Tampa, Florida, where workers will soon break ground on a new high-speed railroad funded by the Recovery Act. There are projects like that all across this country that will create jobs and help our nation move goods, services, and information. We should put more Americans to work building clean energy facilities, and give rebates to Americans who make their homes more energy efficient, which supports clean energy jobs. And to encourage these and other businesses to stay within our borders, it’s time to finally slash the tax breaks for companies that ship our jobs overseas and give those tax breaks to companies that create jobs in the United States of America.
The House has passed a jobs bill that includes some of these steps. As the first order of business this year, I urge the Senate to do the same. People are out of work. They are hurting. They need our help. And I want a jobs bill on my desk without delay.
But the truth is, these steps still won’t make up for the seven million jobs we’ve lost over the last two years. The only way to move to full employment is to lay a new foundation for long-term economic growth, and finally address the problems that America’s families have confronted for years.
We cannot afford another so-called economic “expansion” like the one from last decade – what some call the “lost decade” – where jobs grew more slowly than during any prior expansion; where the income of the average American household declined while the cost of health care and tuition reached record highs; where prosperity was built on a housing bubble and financial speculation.
From the day I took office, I have been told that addressing our larger challenges is too ambitious – that such efforts would be too contentious, that our political system is too gridlocked, and that we should just put things on hold for awhile.
How long should we wait? How long should America put its future on hold?
You see, Washington has been telling us to wait for decades, even as the problems have grown worse. Meanwhile, China’s not waiting to revamp its economy. Germany’s not waiting. India’s not waiting. These nations aren’t standing still. These nations aren’t playing for second place. They’re putting more emphasis on math and science. They’re rebuilding their infrastructure. They are making serious investments in clean energy because they want those jobs.
Well I do not accept second-place for the United States of America. As hard as it may be, as uncomfortable and contentious as the debates may be, it’s time to get serious about fixing the problems that are hampering our growth.
One place to start is serious financial reform. Look, I am not interested in punishing banks, I’m interested in protecting our economy. A strong, healthy financial market makes it possible for businesses to access credit and create new jobs. It channels the savings of families into investments that raise incomes. But that can only happen if we guard against the same recklessness that nearly brought down our entire economy.
We need to make sure consumers and middle-class families have the information they need to make financial decisions. We can’t allow financial institutions, including those that take your deposits, to take risks that threaten the whole economy.
The House has already passed financial reform with many of these changes. And the lobbyists are already trying to kill it. Well, we cannot let them win this fight. And if the bill that ends up on my desk does not meet the test of real reform, I will send it back.
Next, we need to encourage American innovation. Last year, we made the largest investment in basic research funding in history – an investment that could lead to the world’s cheapest solar cells or treatment that kills cancer cells but leaves healthy ones untouched. And no area is more ripe for such innovation than energy. You can see the results of last year’s investment in clean energy – in the North Carolina company that will create 1200 jobs nationwide helping to make advanced batteries; or in the California business that will put 1,000 people to work making solar panels.
But to create more of these clean energy jobs, we need more production, more efficiency, more incentives. That means building a new generation of safe, clean nuclear power plants in this country. It means making tough decisions about opening new offshore areas for oil and gas development. It means continued investment in advanced biofuels and clean coal technologies. And yes, it means passing a comprehensive energy and climate bill with incentives that will finally make clean energy the profitable kind of energy in America.
I am grateful to the House for passing such a bill last year. This year, I am eager to help advance the bipartisan effort in the Senate. I know there have been questions about whether we can afford such changes in a tough economy; and I know that there are those who disagree with the overwhelming scientific evidence on climate change. But even if you doubt the evidence, providing incentives for energy efficiency and clean energy are the right thing to do for our future – because the nation that leads the clean energy economy will be the nation that leads the global economy. And America must be that nation.
Third, we need to export more of our goods. Because the more products we make and sell to other countries, the more jobs we support right here in America. So tonight, we set a new goal: We will double our exports over the next five years, an increase that will support two million jobs in America. To help meet this goal, we’re launching a National Export Initiative that will help farmers and small businesses increase their exports, and reform export controls consistent with national security.
We have to seek new markets aggressively, just as our competitors are. If America sits on the sidelines while other nations sign trade deals, we will lose the chance to create jobs on our shores. But realizing those benefits also means enforcing those agreements so our trading partners play by the rules. And that’s why we will continue to shape a Doha trade agreement that opens global markets, and why we will strengthen our trade relations in Asia and with key partners like South Korea, Panama, and Colombia.
Fourth, we need to invest in the skills and education of our people.
This year, we have broken through the stalemate between left and right by launching a national competition to improve our schools. The idea here is simple: instead of rewarding failure, we only reward success. Instead of funding the status quo, we only invest in reform – reform that raises student achievement, inspires students to excel in math and science, and turns around failing schools that steal the future of too many young Americans, from rural communities to inner-cities. In the 21st century, one of the best anti-poverty programs is a world-class education. In this country, the success of our children cannot depend more on where they live than their potential.
When we renew the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, we will work with Congress to expand these reforms to all fifty states. Still, in this economy, a high school diploma no longer guarantees a good job. I urge the Senate to follow the House and pass a bill that will revitalize our community colleges, which are a career pathway to the children of so many working families. To make college more affordable, this bill will finally end the unwarranted taxpayer-subsidies that go to banks for student loans. Instead, let’s take that money and give families a $10,000 tax credit for four years of college and increase Pell Grants. And let’s tell another one million students that when they graduate, they will be required to pay only ten percent of their income on student loans, and all of their debt will be forgiven after twenty years – and forgiven after ten years if they choose a career in public service. Because in the United States of America, no one should go broke because they chose to go to college. And it’s time for colleges and universities to get serious about cutting their own costs – because they too have a responsibility to help solve this problem.
Now, the price of college tuition is just one of the burdens facing the middle-class. That’s why last year I asked Vice President Biden to chair a task force on Middle-Class Families. That’s why we’re nearly doubling the child care tax credit, and making it easier to save for retirement by giving every worker access to a retirement account and expanding the tax credit for those who start a nest egg. That’s why we’re working to lift the value of a family’s single largest investment – their home. The steps we took last year to shore up the housing market have allowed millions of Americans to take out new loans and save an average of $1,500 on mortgage payments. This year, we will step up re-financing so that homeowners can move into more affordable mortgages. And it is precisely to relieve the burden on middle-class families that we still need health insurance reform.
Now let’s be clear – I did not choose to tackle this issue to get some legislative victory under my belt. And by now it should be fairly obvious that I didn’t take on health care because it was good politics.
I took on health care because of the stories I’ve heard from Americans with pre-existing conditions whose lives depend on getting coverage; patients who’ve been denied coverage; and families – even those with insurance – who are just one illness away from financial ruin.
After nearly a century of trying, we are closer than ever to bringing more security to the lives of so many Americans. The approach we’ve taken would protect every American from the worst practices of the insurance industry. It would give small businesses and uninsured Americans a chance to choose an affordable health care plan in a competitive market. It would require every insurance plan to cover preventive care. And by the way, I want to acknowledge our First Lady, Michelle Obama, who this year is creating a national movement to tackle the epidemic of childhood obesity and make our kids healthier.
Our approach would preserve the right of Americans who have insurance to keep their doctor and their plan. It would reduce costs and premiums for millions of families and businesses. And according to the Congressional Budget Office – the independent organization that both parties have cited as the official scorekeeper for Congress – our approach would bring down the deficit by as much as $1 trillion over the next two decades.
Still, this is a complex issue, and the longer it was debated, the more skeptical people became. I take my share of the blame for not explaining it more clearly to the American people. And I know that with all the lobbying and horse-trading, this process left most Americans wondering what’s in it for them.
But I also know this problem is not going away. By the time I’m finished speaking tonight, more Americans will have lost their health insurance. Millions will lose it this year. Our deficit will grow. Premiums will go up. Patients will be denied the care they need. Small business owners will continue to drop coverage altogether. I will not walk away from these Americans, and neither should the people in this chamber.
As temperatures cool, I want everyone to take another look at the plan we’ve proposed. There’s a reason why many doctors, nurses, and health care experts who know our system best consider this approach a vast improvement over the status quo. But if anyone from either party has a better approach that will bring down premiums, bring down the deficit, cover the uninsured, strengthen Medicare for seniors, and stop insurance company abuses, let me know. Here’s what I ask of Congress, though: Do not walk away from reform. Not now. Not when we are so close. Let us find a way to come together and finish the job for the American people.
Now, even as health care reform would reduce our deficit, it’s not enough to dig us out of a massive fiscal hole in which we find ourselves. It’s a challenge that makes all others that much harder to solve, and one that’s been subject to a lot of political posturing.
So let me start the discussion of government spending by setting the record straight. At the beginning of the last decade, America had a budget surplus of over $200 billion. By the time I took office, we had a one year deficit of over $1 trillion and projected deficits of $8 trillion over the next decade. Most of this was the result of not paying for two wars, two tax cuts, and an expensive prescription drug program. On top of that, the effects of the recession put a $3 trillion hole in our budget. That was before I walked in the door.
Now if we had taken office in ordinary times, I would have liked nothing more than to start bringing down the deficit. But we took office amid a crisis, and our efforts to prevent a second Depression have added another $1 trillion to our national debt.
I am absolutely convinced that was the right thing to do. But families across the country are tightening their belts and making tough decisions. The federal government should do the same. So tonight, I’m proposing specific steps to pay for the $1 trillion that it took to rescue the economy last year.
Starting in 2011, we are prepared to freeze government spending for three years. Spending related to our national security, Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security will not be affected. But all other discretionary government programs will. Like any cash-strapped family, we will work within a budget to invest in what we need and sacrifice what we don’t. And if I have to enforce this discipline by veto, I will.
We will continue to go through the budget line by line to eliminate programs that we can’t afford and don’t work. We’ve already identified $20 billion in savings for next year. To help working families, we will extend our middle-class tax cuts. But at a time of record deficits, we will not continue tax cuts for oil companies, investment fund managers, and those making over $250,000 a year. We just can’t afford it.
Now, even after paying for what we spent on my watch, we will still face the massive deficit we had when I took office. More importantly, the cost of Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security will continue to skyrocket. That’s why I’ve called for a bipartisan, Fiscal Commission, modeled on a proposal by Republican Judd Gregg and Democrat Kent Conrad. This can’t be one of those Washington gimmicks that lets us pretend we solved a problem. The Commission will have to provide a specific set of solutions by a certain deadline. Yesterday, the Senate blocked a bill that would have created this commission. So I will issue an executive order that will allow us to go forward, because I refuse to pass this problem on to another generation of Americans. And when the vote comes tomorrow, the Senate should restore the pay-as-you-go law that was a big reason why we had record surpluses in the 1990s.
I know that some in my own party will argue that we cannot address the deficit or freeze government spending when so many are still hurting. I agree, which is why this freeze will not take effect until next year, when the economy is stronger. But understand – if we do not take meaningful steps to rein in our debt, it could damage our markets, increase the cost of borrowing, and jeopardize our recovery – all of which could have an even worse effect on our job growth and family incomes.
From some on the right, I expect we’ll hear a different argument – that if we just make fewer investments in our people, extend tax cuts for wealthier Americans, eliminate more regulations, and maintain the status quo on health care, our deficits will go away. The problem is, that’s what we did for eight years. That’s what helped lead us into this crisis. It’s what helped lead to these deficits. And we cannot do it again.
Rather than fight the same tired battles that have dominated Washington for decades, it’s time to try something new. Let’s invest in our people without leaving them a mountain of debt. Let’s meet our responsibility to the citizens who sent us here. Let’s try common sense.
But we can’t stop there. It’s time to require lobbyists to disclose each contact they make on behalf of a client with my Administration or Congress. And it’s time to put strict limits on the contributions that lobbyists give to candidates for federal office. Last week, the Supreme Court reversed a century of law to open the floodgates for special interests – including foreign corporations – to spend without limit in our elections. Well I don’t think American elections should be bankrolled by America’s most powerful interests, or worse, by foreign entities. They should be decided by the American people, and that’s why I’m urging Democrats and Republicans to pass a bill that helps to right this wrong.
Of course, none of these reforms will even happen if we don’t also reform how we work with one another.
Now, I am not naïve. I never thought the mere fact of my election would usher in peace, harmony, and some post-partisan era. I knew that both parties have fed divisions that are deeply entrenched. And on some issues, there are simply philosophical differences that will always cause us to part ways. These disagreements, about the role of government in our lives, about our national priorities and our national security, have been taking place for over two hundred years. They are the very essence of our democracy.
But what frustrates the American people is a Washington where every day is Election Day. We cannot wage a perpetual campaign where the only goal is to see who can get the most embarrassing headlines about their opponent – a belief that if you lose, I win. Neither party should delay or obstruct every single bill just because they can. The confirmation of well-qualified public servants should not be held hostage to the pet projects or grudges of a few individual Senators. Washington may think that saying anything about the other side, no matter how false, is just part of the game. But it is precisely such politics that has stopped either party from helping the American people. Worse yet, it is sowing further division among our citizens and further distrust in our government.
So no, I will not give up on changing the tone of our politics. I know it’s an election year. And after last week, it is clear that campaign fever has come even earlier than usual. But we still need to govern. To Democrats, I would remind you that we still have the largest majority in decades, and the people expect us to solve some problems, not run for the hills. And if the Republican leadership is going to insist that sixty votes in the Senate are required to do any business at all in this town, then the responsibility to govern is now yours as well. Just saying no to everything may be good short-term politics, but it’s not leadership. We were sent here to serve our citizens, not our ambitions. So let’s show the American people that we can do it together. This week, I’ll be addressing a meeting of the House Republicans. And I would like to begin monthly meetings with both the Democratic and Republican leadership. I know you can’t wait.
Throughout our history, no issue has united this country more than our security. Sadly, some of the unity we felt after 9/11 has dissipated. We can argue all we want about who’s to blame for this, but I am not interested in re-litigating the past. I know that all of us love this country. All of us are committed to its defense. So let’s put aside the schoolyard taunts about who is tough. Let’s reject the false choice between protecting our people and upholding our values. Let’s leave behind the fear and division, and do what it takes to defend our nation and forge a more hopeful future – for America and the world.
That is the work we began last year. Since the day I took office, we have renewed our focus on the terrorists who threaten our nation. We have made substantial investments in our homeland security and disrupted plots that threatened to take American lives. We are filling unacceptable gaps revealed by the failed Christmas attack, with better airline security, and swifter action on our intelligence. We have prohibited torture and strengthened partnerships from the Pacific to South Asia to the Arabian Peninsula. And in the last year, hundreds of Al Qaeda’s fighters and affiliates, including many senior leaders, have been captured or killed – far more than in 2008.
In Afghanistan, we are increasing our troops and training Afghan Security Forces so they can begin to take the lead in July of 2011, and our troops can begin to come home. We will reward good governance, reduce corruption, and support the rights of all Afghans – men and women alike. We are joined by allies and partners who have increased their own commitment, and who will come together tomorrow in London to reaffirm our common purpose. There will be difficult days ahead. But I am confident we will succeed.
As we take the fight to al Qaeda, we are responsibly leaving Iraq to its people. As a candidate, I promised that I would end this war, and that is what I am doing as President. We will have all of our combat troops out of Iraq by the end of this August. We will support the Iraqi government as they hold elections, and continue to partner with the Iraqi people to promote regional peace and prosperity. But make no mistake: this war is ending, and all of our troops are coming home.
Tonight, all of our men and women in uniform - in Iraq, Afghanistan, and around the world – must know that they have our respect, our gratitude, and our full support. And just as they must have the resources they need in war, we all have a responsibility to support them when they come home. That is why we made the largest increase in investments for veterans in decades. That is why we are building a 21st century VA. And that is why Michelle has joined with Jill Biden to forge a national commitment to support military families.
Even as we prosecute two wars, we are also confronting perhaps the greatest danger to the American people – the threat of nuclear weapons. I have embraced the vision of John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan through a strategy that reverses the spread of these weapons, and seeks a world without them. To reduce our stockpiles and launchers, while ensuring our deterrent, the United States and Russia are completing negotiations on the farthest-reaching arms control treaty in nearly two decades. And at April’s Nuclear Security Summit, we will bring forty-four nations together behind a clear goal: securing all vulnerable nuclear materials around the world in four years, so that they never fall into the hands of terrorists.
These diplomatic efforts have also strengthened our hand in dealing with those nations that insist on violating international agreements in pursuit of these weapons. That is why North Korea now faces increased isolation, and stronger sanctions – sanctions that are being vigorously enforced. That is why the international community is more united, and the Islamic Republic of Iran is more isolated. And as Iran’s leaders continue to ignore their obligations, there should be no doubt: they, too, will face growing consequences.
That is the leadership that we are providing – engagement that advances the common security and prosperity of all people. We are working through the G-20 to sustain a lasting global recovery. We are working with Muslim communities around the world to promote science, education and innovation. We have gone from a bystander to a leader in the fight against climate change. We are helping developing countries to feed themselves, and continuing the fight against HIV/AIDS. And we are launching a new initiative that will give us the capacity to respond faster and more effectively to bio-terrorism or an infectious disease – a plan that will counter threats at home, and strengthen public health abroad.
As we have for over sixty years, America takes these actions because our destiny is connected to those beyond our shores. But we also do it because it is right. That is why, as we meet here tonight, over 10,000 Americans are working with many nations to help the people of Haiti recover and rebuild. That is why we stand with the girl who yearns to go to school in Afghanistan; we support the human rights of the women marching through the streets of Iran; and we advocate for the young man denied a job by corruption in Guinea. For America must always stand on the side of freedom and human dignity.
Abroad, America’s greatest source of strength has always been our ideals. The same is true at home. We find unity in our incredible diversity, drawing on the promise enshrined in our Constitution: the notion that we are all created equal, that no matter who you are or what you look like, if you abide by the law you should be protected by it; that if you adhere to our common values you should be treated no different than anyone else.
We must continually renew this promise. My Administration has a Civil Rights Division that is once again prosecuting civil rights violations and employment discrimination. We finally strengthened our laws to protect against crimes driven by hate. This year, I will work with Congress and our military to finally repeal the law that denies gay Americans the right to serve the country they love because of who they are. We are going to crack down on violations of equal pay laws – so that women get equal pay for an equal day’s work. And we should continue the work of fixing our broken immigration system – to secure our borders, enforce our laws, and ensure that everyone who plays by the rules can contribute to our economy and enrich our nations.
In the end, it is our ideals, our values, that built America – values that allowed us to forge a nation made up of immigrants from every corner of the globe; values that drive our citizens still. Every day, Americans meet their responsibilities to their families and their employers. Time and again, they lend a hand to their neighbors and give back to their country. They take pride in their labor, and are generous in spirit. These aren’t Republican values or Democratic values they’re living by; business values or labor values. They are American values.
Unfortunately, too many of our citizens have lost faith that our biggest institutions – our corporations, our media, and yes, our government – still reflect these same values. Each of these institutions are full of honorable men and women doing important work that helps our country prosper. But each time a CEO rewards himself for failure, or a banker puts the rest of us at risk for his own selfish gain, people’s doubts grow. Each time lobbyists game the system or politicians tear each other down instead of lifting this country up, we lose faith. The more that TV pundits reduce serious debates into silly arguments, and big issues into sound bites, our citizens turn away.
No wonder there’s so much cynicism out there.
No wonder there’s so much disappointment.
I campaigned on the promise of change – change we can believe in, the slogan went. And right now, I know there are many Americans who aren’t sure if they still believe we can change – or at least, that I can deliver it.
But remember this – I never suggested that change would be easy, or that I can do it alone. Democracy in a nation of three hundred million people can be noisy and messy and complicated. And when you try to do big things and make big changes, it stirs passions and controversy. That’s just how it is.
Those of us in public office can respond to this reality by playing it safe and avoid telling hard truths. We can do what’s necessary to keep our poll numbers high, and get through the next election instead of doing what’s best for the next generation.
But I also know this: if people had made that decision fifty years ago or one hundred years ago or two hundred years ago, we wouldn’t be here tonight. The only reason we are is because generations of Americans were unafraid to do what was hard; to do what was needed even when success was uncertain; to do what it took to keep the dream of this nation alive for their children and grandchildren.
Our administration has had some political setbacks this year, and some of them were deserved. But I wake up every day knowing that they are nothing compared to the setbacks that families all across this country have faced this year. And what keeps me going – what keeps me fighting – is that despite all these setbacks, that spirit of determination and optimism – that fundamental decency that has always been at the core of the American people – lives on.
It lives on in the 8-year old boy in Louisiana, who just sent me his allowance and asked if I would give it to the people of Haiti. And it lives on in all the Americans who’ve dropped everything to go some place they’ve never been and pull people they’ve never known from rubble, prompting chants of “U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A!” when another life was saved.
The spirit that has sustained this nation for more than two centuries lives on in you, its people.
We have finished a difficult year. We have come through a difficult decade. But a new year has come. A new decade stretches before us. We don’t quit. I don’t quit. Let’s seize this moment – to start anew, to carry the dream forward, and to strengthen our union once more.
I admire our President, beyond words.
This man simply brings me great hope on a daily basis – and belief in the future and our country.
I support the course he and his administration have charted this past year – while I am beyond frustrated and angry with Democrats and Republican alike, in both Chambers.
The politicians need to stop running for office; start working together and DO SOMETHING!! The American people can deal with not getting everything they might want individually if they believe that their representatives are honestly trying to do their best for the country.
I may be naive, but ""can't we all just get along""?
I really hope he follows through with college tuition reform. I want to be a professional who isn't broke!",en,reference

"Bentley Continental GT. The owner of this 18 month old Bentley Continetal GT wanted a thorough detail as it had picked up a few swirls, the engine bay was in need of some TLC & the interior a general good clean & some protection applied for ease of maintenance in the future. He did his home work & after a another Bentley owner posted up on his forum about me gave me a call & stopped by the unit with the car for an assessment. We had a good chat, I looked over the car with him & his lovely wife. I made a suggestion of what I thought the car needed to take it to the condition he required & we booked a 4 day detail + cermic coating, which was completed over 5 days.
The car was cleaned in the usual manner with all the safe wash practises, with an additional one, The car has air suspenion so this needs to be disabled or in this case put the car into “jack mode” via a few buttons on the dash. I always consult the owners manual just to be safe. Outside the bodywork, alloys wheel arches & engine bay were cleaned correctly.
Inside with “jack mode” enabled the car was put onto the scissor lift & wheels removed once again for steam cleaning of the wheel arches, calipers etc. The pins are to aid in safely removing the alloys without any damage to break disc or wheel (simple but very effective).
The paintwork was polished in two stages, the first to remove safely as many defects (swirls) as possible & the second to restore that beautiful glossy wet look. A few finished shots prior to ceramic coating application.
Bentley Continental GT, 5 day detail with ceramic coating application. Superb car to work on & a real pleasure to detail this for the owners.
If you would like or know someone that would like a similar detail please feel free to get in touch, or if you have a new car arriving soon why not look at the new car detail ?",en,web

"The 2011 Design Showcase was decorated by Patricia Marion Cove Architectural Interiors and Design.
Imagine having your house redecorated – top to bottom – by a team of outstanding interior designers at no charge.
No, this isn’t a reality TV show, it’s what some lucky homeowner in Chestnut Hill, or the surrounding area, will experience if their home is selected for the Fall 2013 Designer Showcase benefiting the Chestnut Hill Center for Enrichment.
Each room in the house will reflect the talents of a top interior designer with fresh paint, new wall and window treatments, alluring furnishings and exquisite details. Even the exterior will get instant curb appeal with new landscape design. Previous designers have included Patricia Cove, Hannah Dee and Maria Hasenecz of Livable Landscapes.
“It doesn’t have to be a particularly large house, but it should be interesting and have ample parking,” said Marilyn Paucker, CHCE board president.
Because many homeowners, other than the President and First Lady, aren’t comfortable with people trooping through their house, the ideal situation is an unoccupied house that is for sale.
“Houses that had languished on the market sold very quickly once they became Designer Showcase Houses,” Paucker said. “The new owners didn’t just want the house – they wanted everything in it.
“The search is now underway for our next Designer Showcase House,” Paucker said. “Residents must be willing to allow designers to view the house several weeks this spring. Work would be done from August through September, and then opened to the viewing public at the end of September into early October.

"Canada continues to be one of the world’s top markets for international brands seeking to open freestanding stores. A substantial number of retailers opened their first stores in Canada last year, and the trend will continue into 2017 and beyond.
In the most recent edition of Retail Council of Canada’s Canadian Retailer magazine, 21 international brands were identified as having opened their first freestanding stores in Canada in 2016. The diverse list of retailers include large format stores such as Saks Fifth Avenue, boutiques such as Ladurée and Christian Louboutin, and even eyewear retailers such as Warby Parker. The entire article and list can be viewed here, and it was compiled by Retail Insider’s Craig Patterson, who is now also writing selected articles in Canadian Retailer.
All first-to-market openings last year were in Canada’s three largest metropolitan regions (Toronto/ Montreal/ Vancouver). Of the 21 international brands identified as having opened their first freestanding stores in Canada last year, 12 were in the Greater Toronto Area, five were in the Vancouver area, and four were in Montreal.
As well, CBRE has just released its 10th annual study (PDF download) of international retail expansion, ranking Toronto as North America’s top city for international brands entering the market. CBRE’s study says that it identified 30 new international retailers that opened stores in Toronto last year — coffee shops and restaurants were included in the study. Toronto was the only city in North America to make the study’s top 10 list and according to CBRE, 43% of the retailers that entered the city were from the United States. The study surveyed 166 cities across 51 countries to determine how many international retailers had debuted in their markets in 2016.
In the CBRE study, only eight global cities saw more new international entrants than Toronto. These can be viewed in the graphics below.
Despite recent reports that some retailers are struggling in Canada, there’s no end in sight for international brands entering Canada with new stores. We have a list of new retailers confirmed to be opening their first stores in Canada in 2017, which is longer than our published 2016 list (we’ll reveal more in the coming months). What’s evident is that Toronto will continue to be the country’s leader for international brands opening their first stores in Canada, and that Toronto’s Yorkdale Shopping Centre will be a launch point for a considerable number of them.
Another interesting phenomenon is when brands open freestanding stores, as has been the case in Canada as of late. Notable brands opening freestanding stores include Canada Goose, Urban Decay, Strellson (our article on Strellson in Canadian Retailer), among others. It will be a topic of discussion at this year’s Retail Council of Canada STORE Conference, taking place next week (May 30 and 31) in Toronto. Retail Insider’s Craig Patterson will be hosting ’The Merchant’s Roundtable' on the topic of brands opening stores on Tuesday, May 30 at 10:50 am. Panelists will include representatives from Hallmark, HUBBA and luxury watch brand Breitling — the latter recently announced that it would be opening its first Canadian boutique this summer at Toronto’s Yorkdale Shopping Centre.",en,web

"Self-employed mothers are looking for more Government aid to drive their businesses forward, according to an entrepreneurship expert from Manchester Metropolitan University (MMU).
Latest figures from the Office of National Statistics (ONS) show a 34 per cent increase in the number of self-employed women in the UK since 2009, but Dr Julia Rouse of MMU believes this figure clouds the fact many female entrepreneurs are unlikely to turn a profit until they receive adequate Government support regarding maternity and childcare.
According to Dr Rouse, female entrepreneurs make up just a third of the UK’s self-employed population; the equivalent of 1.4 million and the most popular self-employed occupations for females include child-minding, cleaning, caring and hairdressing – the majority of which earn less than £10,000-a-year.
Rouse believes the rise in female self-employment merely reflects the disproportionate impact of the recession on women’s full-time employment opportunities, particularly in the public sector.
Improved Government support and better targeted policies would provide the right working conditions to support ambitious women, particularly mothers, to launch profitable, long-lasting businesses.
“To date, enterprise policy has not been well integrated with childcare and maternity policies, which simply don’t meet the needs of women wanting to launch a business,” said Rouse.
“The failure of successive Governments to understand the strength of the maternity and childcare barrier to enterprise means that a great deal of female entrepreneurial potential is being wasted.
Ms Rouse believes female entrepreneurs require better funded childcare support when they start a new business, as tax breaks mean very little if they are failing to turn a profit.
The addition of childcare support would also be a ‘great investment’ for established businesses which struggle to grow while women are ‘tied to their local area and part-time working due to the school run’.",en,web

"Computer networks, including the internet, are having an ever-increasing impact on everyday life. Computer networks come in many shapes and sizes. The internet is the largest man made structure, while bluetooth networks may cover just a desktop. The WAND group is the department's computer networks research group.
One major focus of the WAND group is developing high performance networks. This work starts with designing and building measurement tools and techniques to study real networks. The data obtained from measurement can be used directly for management or used to build simulation models and perform detailed analysis of a range of possible scenarios perhaps including networks that can not currently be built. The WAND group is also developing visualisation software to display network traffic and aid in understanding the behaviour of measured networks and simulations. The group has a large test bed network for emulating real networks. This is used for development of tools and protocols, verification of our simulations and for testing new network devices.
Another major focus of the group is long distance wireless networks. The main project in this area is looking at connecting rural communities using low cost wireless technologies. Aspects of this work include developing network management systems, developing new routing algorithms and designing hardware including wireless NIC cards. As a part of this work the group has built wireless networks connecting rural schools and communities in the Waikato and Te Urewera National Park areas. Networks have also been built in the Pacific Islands and rural South Africa. The group is also embarking on a rapid deploy project looking at how wireless networks can be deployed in a matter of hours using minimal levels of expertise for disaster recovery and also for special events.",en,reference

"Merry Late Christmas, friends! And happy almost New Year! I hope everyone had a wonderful time last week! Mine was full of time with family and sweet presents from my parents, siblings, and grandparents. It was followed by a crazy day working at Anthro during our after-Christmas sales (complete with an evening of tornado warnings!), so I was very thankful for Sunday's day off to stay home through the thunderstorms. I've finished my 2016 PowerSheets goal setting prep, which I'll be sharing soon, and had lots of time to look back over this year.
Goodness, 2015 was certainly a good one.
My words of the year were BRAVE and GOLD.
I set goals for the year that were both met, attempted, and let fall to the wayside.
I started my journey with Young Living Essential Oils, and I've loved every minute of it.
I cut off all my hair into a 1920's bob for a show and only freaked out a little... or a lot.
I traveled to Nevada, Colorado, South Carolina, Indiana, and Washington.
I attended both Hope Spoken and The Influence Conference, and they rocked my world!
I completed my first year of graduate school, performing in These Shining Lives as Catherine.
I started my second year of graduate school, directing Almost, Maine as my ""thesis"" show.
I started a Monday midday Periscope called Make Mondays Meaningful, and it's been a blast!
I discovered Illustrated Faith, creatively connecting with scripture, and joined their creative team!
I had a lofty goal of reading 100 books/plays this year, and between the two I got pretty close.
If you're looking for books to add to your reading list for 2016, look no further! And I just love these types of review things, so be prepared for a few more before the week is done.
Now what did YOU do in 2016?
Any books I need to know about?",en,web

"Today, bus services operate in crowded and narrow roads with very low average speed thus reducing commuter benefits wherein buses also add to traffic congestion. Where the systems like Metro or BRT cannot be implemented, Monorail can be easily implemented and can negotiate sharp turns and climb up and down steep gradients easily. The decision to introduce Chembur – Wadala – Sant Gadge Maharaj Chowk - 20 Km long Monorail corridor, as a feeder service to the other Transit System and to cater crowded and narrow congested areas was taken by the Authority in its 119th meeting held on 28th September, 2007.
MMRDA appointed M/s. RITES as a consultant for preparation of Techno-Economic feasibility report as well as providing assistance in Bid process management. The Techno – Economic and Financial Feasibility study for the project was completed by M/s. RITES and a notification dated 4th November, 2008 was published by Government of Maharashtra for implementation of the project under Tramway Act.

"As research shows a growing number of young, married women don't want to take their man's surname after tying the knot, Louisa Peacock says it's not about 'embracing feminism' but reacting normally in a society where girls are just as proud of their names as men.
It was the ultimate playground fantasy game. Pick a boy, starting with the cutest one in the class, and work out if his surname would actually 'go' with yours – you know, if you ever got married. If it didn't 'go', i.e. – the sounds and syllables didn't match, or it was just too darn clunky – well, you were destined not to be together. Move on. It was a reliable a test as finding out his star sign and seeing if it was compatible with yours. Ha, do you remember when we actually used to do that?
Fast forward to my post-school, university years (you know, where I was all grown up) and I'd dropped the star sign stuff but I have to admit, I was still playing the surname game. If anything it was just fun. I'd always thought about what my new surname would be once I got married. I was brought up believing that it was just custom and tradition and the normal thing to do: a woman would take a man's surname after tying the knot, no questions asked.
It was even better for me then, that the man I married last year had a pretty cool surname. One that I would be proud of adopting and calling my own ... Except I haven't.
It's been 11 months since we got hitched, and, *awkward pause*, I am yet to change my surname. There's a whole multitude of reasons why not. One, the paperwork involved. Two, I just haven't got around to it. Three, did I mention the paperwork? Four, err, I just haven't got around to it. OK, there aren't that many reasons.
Would you change your surname to your husband's?
Why am I so reluctant to take joint bank account plunge?
Why can't your mum's name be on your wedding certificate?
Truth is, I actually like being a Peacock. I never thought I'd care about losing my surname; the one which leads to endless jokes – not those jokes – the innocent kind such as from my geography teacher who insisted on calling me Peahen (because I was a girl). Not even funny.
Truth is, I don't want to give up my surname. Not really. And it seems I'm part of a growing generation of young women who don't want to change their name either. According to a study, a third of married women in their twenties decided against adopting the surnames of their husbands, compared to the majority of those in their sixties.
Researchers have put this trend down to young women today ""embracing feminism"" – the political movement of equal rights and sisterhood. I think it's much more simple than that. I hazard a guess that most young women who don't change their surnames after marriage aren't doing so to make a political point. More, they just don't see the need or reason to change the name they've grown up with their entire life.
A distant relative of mine 20 years ago refused to change her name when she got married – and our family spent the rest of the month gossiping about it. It just wasn't the 'done thing' back then not to take his name.
Fast forward 20 years, and I feel that if I lose Peacock, I lose a little part of me, my childhood and who I am. It's for pure selfish reasons I want to keep Peacock – not to spite mankind or to prove that I'm independent. The point is, I never knew how it would feel to lose my name until the crunch point actually came, and I realised that I didn't want to do it.
My sister and I have no brothers, so if we both got married and changed our surnames, there'd be no one around to carry on the Peacock line. And I'm proud to be a Peacock.
We are at a tipping point in society. Women not changing their names after marriage doesn't mean anything except that a) they can't be bothered or b) they don't feel the need. It's not a sign of feminism suddenly sweeping the nation. It is just what's seen as normal nowadays – not becoming something you're not. Keeping you. Being you.
Unlike my distant relative, we may all look back and wonder why on earth women took men's names in the first place.",en,books
"Monsanto has donated $4 million in seeds to Haiti, sending 60 tons of conventional hybrid corn and vegetable seed, followed by 70 more tons of corn seed last week with an additional 345 tons of corn seed to come during the next year. Yet the number one recommendation of a recent report by Catholic Relief Services on post-earthquake Haiti is to focus on local seed fairs and not to introduce new or “improved” varieties at this time.
Will Haitian farmers be able to use existing farming methods with these seeds or do they require a completely different set of techniques – for example, is it possible for these seeds to be banked year to year for use in more than one planting cycle? Hybrid seeds don’t have a great track record for re-planting, which means that farmers typically must buy new seeds every year.
Does cultivation of these seeds require expensive new inputs and/or chemicals that may negatively impact the environment and soil over the long-term? Hybrids typically require a lot of fertilizers, pesticides, etc. and according to the press release, these will be provided through the USAID’s 5-year WINNER program. When the WINNER program is done, will farmers find themselves reliant on external inputs they can’t afford or access? What will the inputs leave behind in terms of the soil’s condition?
Will the rest of the Monsanto seeds sent to Haiti over the next year be conventional or genetically modified (GM)? GM seeds are as controversial in Haiti as they are here at home. It is critical that Haitians themselves are in charge of the decision to plant or not plant GM; they first need to know what is being offered to them in the first place.
Will the Monsanto seeds (whether conventional or GM) affect indigenous seed diversity by mixing with them and contaminating existing seed strains? Large influxes of non-native seeds have touched off controversy and alarmed environmental activists and peasant farmers from Mexico to Malaysia to Mali.
Agricultural development is critical for Haiti and was even before the earthquake. Lambi Fund of Haiti, a partner organization of American Jewish World Service (AJWS), has been working with rural communities to create indigenous seed banks, building expertise in farming techniques and using environmentally-friendly methods to renew depleted Haitian soil.
Advocates for common sense food aid, including AJWS, are asking Congress to spend the $150 million dollars requested by the Obama Administration for Food Aid to Haiti on resources that will help Haiti feed itself for the long-term. You can make your voice heard by signing this petition.
Monsanto’s donation – just like the US government’s in-kind food aid donations – should empower rather than dis-empower the rural communities working to grow food for their country over the long term. More to the point, the communities most affected by these donations should decide whether they want this aid at all and if so, what they want and when they want it. It’s unclear in this case if Monsanto or anyone else has asked them.",en,reference
"VCarve Pro provide a powerful but intuitive software solution for 2D design and calculation of 2D and 2.5D toolpaths for cutting parts on a CNC Router. It includes the functionality demanded by commercial shops and users, while remaining incredibly easy to use and affordably priced. VCarve Pro is used by cabiner makers, wood workers, sign makers, prop makers, plastic fabricators, hobbyists and in many other applications.
The software can import 2D designs from other programs but also includes a full set of drawing and editing tools with advanced layout options such as True-Shape Nesting. The toolpath options cover all typical 2D routing operations such as Profiling, Pocketing, Auto-Inlays and Drilling as well as 2.5D strategies such as V-Carving, Prism carving, Fluting and even a decorative Texturing strategy. Each toolpath includes appropriate options to customize the settings and provide a high level of control for different types of operation. In addition all toolpaths can be previewed to show just how the part will look when it is actually cut, this allows instant feedback to allow toolpaths to be further optimized.
The software has a comprehensive set of drawing tools to let you easily create vectors from scratch or add to imported data. These include options for creating standard shapes (circle, elipse, rectangle, polygon and star) along with line, curve and arc drawing tools. These tools can be controlled using typed input to create exact sized objects or can be used dynamically with the mouse to sketch your artwork. The tools also take advantage of the 'snapping' to let you use points on existing objects to 'snap' onto when you are drawing vectors.
The Advanced Text Tools let you access True Type or Open Type fonts on your PC to create text outlines for your design. In addition the software comes with a selection of specialist Single Stroke / Stick Engraving Fonts for efficient machining when making things like badges or small signs. The text can be controlled using automatic sizing and layout options. There are also editing tools for Fitting Text to a Curve and interactive text arcing and spacing (kerning).
As well as 'simple' VCarving, the software supports many advanced VCarving strategies, such as 'Flat Bottomed' v-carving, optionally using a second flat bottom tool to optimally clear out the flat areas. Another advanced capability is the support for v-carving areas wider than the tool by making multiple clearance passes to achieve the required depth.",en,reference
"Given the Christmas period, many businesses will be under pressure to set new Google Ads campaigns live.
Here are 5 tips to ensure your Google Ads are not rejected to save you time and resource during this busy season.
1- Typos – Google imposes strict policies around an ad’s quality and relevance—including requiring standard spelling and grammar.
2- Extra punctuation marks e.g. Buy Now!!! - Google considers exclamations in either of the two headline fields to be disruptive and these are another common cause for ad rejections.
3- Unnecessary use of symbols e.g. &%^* or symbols used incorrectly to represent ‘and’ might be rejected.
4- GiMmIcKy CAPITALISATION – As with typos, Google’s policies around quality and relevance will make ads using unnecessary and gimmicky capitalisation likely to be rejected.
5- Spelling Emojis – With Google requiring standard spelling and grammar, spelling out emojis e.g. :) will also likely result in ads being disapproved.",en,reference
"An oligosaccharide is a saccharide polymer containing a small number (typically three to ten) of component sugars, also known as simple sugars.
They are generally found either O- or N-linked to compatible amino acid side chains in proteins or to lipid moieties (see glycans).
Fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS), which are found in many vegetables, consist of short chains of fructose molecules. Inulin has a much higher degree of polymerization than FOS and is a polysaccharide. Galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS), which also occur naturally, consist of short chains of galactose molecules. These compounds can be only partially digested by humans.
Oligosaccharides are often found as a component of glycoproteins or glycolipids and as such are often used as chemical markers, often for cell recognition. An example is ABO blood type specificity. A and B blood types have two different oligosaccharide glycolipids embedded in the cell membranes of the red blood cells, AB-type blood has both, while O blood type has neither.
Mannan-oligosaccharides (MOS) are widely used in animal feed to encourage gastrointestinal health and performance. They are normally obtained from the yeast cell walls of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Some brand names are: Bio-Mos, SAF-Mannan, Y-MOS and Celmanax.
When oligosaccharides are consumed, the undigested portion serves as food for the intestinal microflora. Depending on the type of oligosaccharide, different bacterial groups are stimulated or suppressed.
Clinical studies have shown that administering FOS, GOS, or inulin can increase the number of these friendly bacteria in the colon while simultaneously reducing the population of harmful bacteria.
Other benefits noted with FOS, GOS, or inulin supplementation include increased production of beneficial short-chain fatty acids such as butyrate, increased absorption of calcium and magnesium, and improved elimination of toxic compounds.
Because FOS, GOS, and inulin improve colon function and may influence the bacterial composition, one might expect these compounds would help relieve the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome. However, a double-blind trial found no clear benefit with FOS supplementation (2 grams three times daily) in patients with this condition.
Experimental studies with FOS in animals suggest a possible benefit in lowering blood sugar levels in people with diabetes and in reducing elevated blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels.
In a double-blind trial of middle-aged men and women with elevated cholesterol and triglyceride levels, supplementation with inulin (10 grams per day for eight weeks) significantly reduced insulin concentrations, suggesting an improvement in blood-glucose control, and significantly lowered triglyceride levels.
In a preliminary trial, administration of FOS (8 grams per day for two weeks) significantly lowered fasting blood-sugar levels and serum total-cholesterol levels in patients with type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes.
However, in another trial, people with type 2 diabetes supplementing with FOS (15 grams per day) for 20 days found no effect on blood-glucose or lipid levels. Because of these conflicting results, more research is needed to determine the effect of FOS and inulin on diabetes and lipid levels.
Several double-blind trials have looked at the ability of FOS or inulin to lower blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels. These trials have shown that in people with elevated total cholesterol or triglyceride levels, including people with type 2 (adult onset) diabetes, FOS or inulin (in amounts ranging from 8 to 20 grams daily) produced significant reductions in triglyceride levels. However, the effect on cholesterol levels was inconsistent. In people with normal or low cholesterol or triglyceride levels, FOS or inulin produced little effect.
FOS and inulin are found naturally in Jerusalem artichoke, burdock, chicory, leeks, onions, and asparagus. FOS products derived from chicory root contain significant quantities of inulin, a fiber widely distributed in fruits, vegetables and plants. Inulin is a significant part of the daily diet of most of the world’s population. FOS can also be synthesized by enzymes of the fungus Aspergillus niger acting on sucrose. GOS is naturally found in soybeans and can be synthesized from lactose (milk sugar). FOS, GOS, and inulin are available as nutritional supplements in capsules, tablets, and as a powder.
Not all natural oligosaccharides occur as components of glycoproteins or glycolipids. Some, such as the raffinose series, occur as storage or transport carbohydrates in plants. Others, such as maltodextrins or cellodextrins, result from the microbial breakdown of larger polysaccharides such as starch or cellulose.

"Kryptonite is a golden beer with a nose of mango, clementine and pine resin. The palate evokes sour orange and dried apricot aromas, all of which stretch out to a sharp, resinous bitter finish.
Brewed with oat flakes, malted wheat and Golden Promise malt, and heavily hopped throughout the whirlpool phase, it was afterwards dry-hopped during the fermentation process, so it would benefit from the biotransformation and chemistry between the Vermont Ale yeast and aromatic hops (Citra, Simcoe, Mosaic, Amarillo and Centennial).

"One Pot Weeknight Spaghetti is the perfect dinner solution for busy weeknights!
This is my last week of maternity leave and I have to say – I kind of have mixed emotions about it. On one hand, I’m only going back to work two days a week, so I will be spending more days than not with Lars. But wahhhhhh for having to get up in the morning and wear something other than yoga pants and nursing tanks.
I’m also kind of looking forward to some adult time. While spending 10 hours away from my little guy will be heart wrenching, it does sound kind of nice to not talk in my baby voice all day long to Lars (but let’s face it – I’m really just talking to myself).
So I guess amidst my excitement for autumn, I’m having myself some summer blues with my upcoming return to work.
I can imagine there are lots of you that might have similar feelings – excited for fall but mourning the gone-in-a-blink-of-an-eye summer.
Regardless of what level of summer blues you have, there’s no denying the kids are going back to school, the trees are slowly starting to turn, and pumpkin EVERYTHING is showing up in stores everywhere. This also means my cravings for comfort foods is creeping back in.
Beef stew, chili, casseroles, and spaghetti are all high on my list of comfort foods, and these days I’m looking for ways to make them a quick and easy as possible.
I have to admit – prior to having a baby, I really didn’t understand the appeal of buying pre-packaged foods when I could make them from scratch. I mean, I understood wanting to get dinner on the table as soon as possible, but the logistics of getting dinner ready in 30 minutes pre-baby are way different than now.
For example, pre-baby I likely was able to make a spaghetti sauce from scratch, along with garlic bread and a salad all in 30 minutes. Now, I completely understand the appeal of spaghetti sauce from a jar and those salad kits that have everything you need in the bag (p.s. those are amazing).
So when spaghetti night rolled around, I walked right past the diced tomatoes and fresh herbs, and headed straight to the jars of spaghetti sauce.
To make spaghetti night even easier, I tried my hand at one-pot spaghetti. As in, everything is made in one pot. The beef, the veggies, and even the pasta. This means only one pot to clean up. It’s completely genius!
This recipe is very adaptable to your idea of the perfect spaghetti. If you want to omit the onions and peppers, add mushrooms, or use ground turkey instead of beef, go for it! I have even made this recipe using gluten-free pasta and it turned out great.
No matter how you make it, dinner is guaranteed to be on the table in less than 30 minutes. Spaghetti night has never been easier!
One note about the recipe – I mention that you might need to add more water towards the end. If you find that the sauce is getting pretty thick and the noodles still need a few more minutes to cook, I recommend adding more water, about ¼ cup at a time. When I used the gluten-free spaghetti noodles, I needed to add about ¾ cup of water, and you might need to also! I would guess the type of spaghetti sauce you buy might determine if you need extra water or not, also, as some brands tend to be thinner than others. Just keep an eye on it towards the end and adjust accordingly.
In large pot, brown the beef.
Add olive oil to pot over medium-high heat and saute onion and bell pepper.
Add garlic and saute one more minute.
Add beef back to pot along with spaghetti sauce and water.
Bring to a simmer and then add noodles.
Try to get noodles as submerged in the liquid as you can.
Cook according to the noodle package.
If you find your sauce is getting too thick and the noodles are not cooked yet, add more water, 1/4 cup at a time, up to 3/4 cup more.
sounds yummy! have never tried the one pot method.
I think we could all use more easy meals like this! Hope you're enjoying your last week of maternity leave!",en,web
"One of the key measures of operating efficiency of an insurance company is the combined ratio (COR), which is calculated for the property and casualty insurance sector (Section II).
The consistent improvement in the PZU Group’s combined ratio (for non-life insurance) in successive years arises, among others, from the correct matching of prices and insurance cover offered, the ability to maintain cost discipline (reduction in fixed costs in connection with releasing provisions from previous years, reduction in IT costs following from contract renegotiation and consistent management of remuneration costs for insurance intermediaries).
The improving combined ratio was also a result of the absence of major catastrophic events (such as floods, inundations and snow damage).
The operating efficiency ratios, broken down into individual segments, were presented in the Appendix.

"title Shimmering Silvercoast entry description A shot I made during my stay in Asturias (Spain) this year in summer. I made this shot here at a very iconic beach called „Gueirua“ one rainy afternoon. A single long exposure shot which I found very difficult to make as I was cleaning the lenses all the time due to the rain! And more it was not so comfortable to stay balanced over the rocks and stones during a heavy wind and rain, cleaning all the time the lenses and at the same time trying not to fall into the sea with all my equipment :-) But it was so rewarding to be there and I could’t care less about the weather … I was so happy to finally, finally, finally to see the sea again after so much time as I have no sea in my country :-) about the photographer I’m a passionate landscape photographer based in Switzerland. I startet with photography in 2012 but it was only in 2015 when my interest became a passion or should I say an obsession. Taking images in nature is a great pleasure for me. That means to hike, to explore and to feel a sort of freedom … and to experience nature sometimes at hours and conditions that are not the very best. Exactly the oposite to my life in the office. My goal is to show how I see the world through the lenses as we are only during a limited time here on earth.",en,unknown

"This may have happened to them that one day they change the password for security, and when they try to enter, they find themselves typing the previous password again and again because they have definitely forgotten the new one! Well, fortunately, recovering the Mac password is not a difficult task. So, in this article, we will share a step by step procedure, so that you can do it quickly.
Check if a question sign appears in the password field. If you see it, click on it to show you a password suggestion that can be used so you can remember it.
Try signing in with the password of the Apple ID you use for iCloud.
Apple recommends that if you just change your password, remember the new one and it does not work, try using the old password. If it works, the apple company ensures that you should be able to use the new password as of that moment.
Now, if these steps did not work for you, you can reset it using the wizard to reset passwords. At this point it is vital that FileVault is activated, otherwise, it will not work.
What you have to do is to wait a minute on the login screen, until you find a message that you can use the power button on your Mac to turn off the computer and restart it from the recovery section.
If you waited a while and the message did not come out, then you do not have FileVault enabled and you will not be able to reset your password in this way.
Follow the instructions: press the power button until the Mac shuts down.
Then press the button again to turn it on.
As soon as you see the ‘Reset password’ window, follow the steps to create a new password.
If you have already been able to reset your password, you can log in to the new one.
There is another way to recover your password, in which you must also have FileVault activated: using the recovery key.
When you are on the login screen, if you enter the wrong password three times, a message will appear in which the computer will indicate that you can reset the password with your recovery key.
At that time, you must click on the arrow next to the message, and in the password field enter the recovery key.
There you must follow the instructions to create a new password and when you have finished, you have to click on Reset password.
Restart the Mac and keep the shortcut Cmd + R key pressed to access the recovery partition.
There, choose the Terminal in the Utilities menu and open it. At this point, you have to type reset the password.
Next, a box will appear that will show a list of the boot hard disks connected to the Mac.
It is important to choose the disk in which the account from which we need to change the password is hosted.
Locate the user selection menu and choose the one you need.

My One Word replaces broken promises with a vision for real change. But your only goal in the should be to get invited back for the next round, or get a job offer. The more efficient your body, the better you feel and the more you will use your talent to produce outstanding results.

We're responding to past situations without looking to the future on proactive, action based solutions to help prevent this in creative environments.

"Generic ADHD medications can save you money, but are they as safe and effective as Mydayis, Vyvanse, Evekeo, and other name-brand drugs? Learn about these lower cost prescriptions before choosing them over name-brand drugs.
Do Generic Medications Treat ADHD As Effectively as Name Brands?
Generic medications used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD or ADD) offer a cheap alternative to name-brand prescription drugs. For adults and children with ADHD who need medications as a part of their treatment plan throughout their life, generic drugs can save thousands of dollars in costs. These drugs have become so ubiquitous that, unless otherwise specified, some insurance companies and pharmacists routinely fill prescriptions with generic versions to save both the company and the patient money.
By these standards, the FDA seeks to ensure that the active ingredients in generic drugs are exactly the same as in their name-brand counterparts, but that’s where the uniformity may end. Compounds in generic drugs are allowed to include different binding chemicals, fillers, and colors. Generics made by different manufacturers can differ, as well, as Orologio discovered from his bright yellow methylphenidate pills.
“Identical does not mean ‘same,’“ says Joe Graedon, of People’s Pharmacy, a consumer advocacy website. Graedon first learned of problems with some generics about nine years ago, from a parent whose child had switched from Ritalin to generic methylphenidate; the child’s teachers had noticed a difference in his behavior. Then Graedon heard from many other readers about the varied experiences they had with generic drugs to treat a range of ailments. Some recounted the success they had with the generic drug bupropion, an antidepressant, as opposed to Wellbutrin XL 300.
Concerned, Graedon hired an independent laboratory to test the two drugs. After a series of tests, the laboratory found that the active chemical in the generic form of Wellbutrin XL 300 was released at a different rate than in the name-brand medication. This variation is allowed according to the FDA, which states that a generic must provide “roughly” the same blood level of the active ingredient as the name-brand. Those blood levels can range between 80 to 125 percent of what the name-brand drug achieves. This could be the reason that people have different reactions when they switch from a name-brand drug to a generic, says Graedon. Differences in generic medications likely exist for all conditions and treatments. But, according to Graedon, it isn’t surprising that patients with behavioral, neurological, or mental health conditions will be more likely to notice that they act differently on a slightly different treatment.
Most experts agree that many patients use generic ADHD medications successfully, and that these should remain options for treatment. Still, if you or your child is currently taking a name-brand treatment for ADHD and wants to switch to a generic, it is important to monitor any changes in behavior or symptoms. Outside observers – like teachers, spouses, or parents – often spot behavioral changes sooner than a physician, so it may be helpful to keep a log of your or your child’s symptoms to share with the doctor.
Dominic Orologio, 34, began treatment for ADD symptoms six years ago. His doctor prescribed 30 milligrams of Adderall XR, an extended-release prescription medication. Orologio’s symptoms became more manageable. For the first time in his life, he was able to focus on work at the office.
After a few years on the medication, Orologio’s normal dose was no longer effective throughout the day, a common problem for people taking ADHD medications long-term. What once gave him relief from his ADHD symptoms for most of the day now worked for only about three hours. With his doctor’s advice, Orologio began to take a higher dose of a generic version of the drug.
I learned something recently; there are G (generic) and AG (authorized generic.) I take Adderall XR, 25 mg., originally made by Shire. The two AG manufacturers are Sandoz and Prasco. My Sandoz-manufactured Adderlall XR works very well.
Please correct me if I’ve misunderstood and have gotten this wrong.
Thanks so much for this info, I had no idea and have experienced many issues with generics.

"Try going to the Forestry Commission web site. If you can't find the information there is a page with your local office details on it so you can contact them direct.

I will try and remember to ask when I next see the friend. They might not be Forestry Commission owned woods and I know her brother in law is a timber merchant.
How many wooden logs would i need to see me over the wintertime.
I was told to try and avoid Leylandii as it is too sappy.
How well insulated your house is makes such a difference. We will soon be moving from our caravans which have about an inch of insulation to a house with a foot of insulation. Even though the house is larger we forsee using much less wood.
Would Leylandii logs be okay once seasoned and dry?
It would be burnt in a closed wood burner so spitting should not be an issue.
How Much Wood Should i Get For The Winter?

"There are many people who claim Prophethood to fulfill their materialistic desires. If you look at Prophet Muhammad(Peace be upon him) you will find that his life was better before, than after claiming Prophethood. Prophet Muhammad(Peace be upon him) is so simple and used to sleep on mat made of straws which will put marks on his shoulders. Prophet Muhammad(Peace be upon him) told his companions that if the Arabs(who were hell bent on stopping the propagation of Islam) put Sun on one hand and the moon on the other hand, he won't give up this work of Dawah, inviting people to the truth.
Once his wives tried to pursue him for more luxurious life but Prophet Muhammad(Peace be upon him) refused to do so and there was a revelation from Allah Almighty saying ""O Prophet, say to your wives, ""If you should desire the worldly life and its adornment, then come, I will provide for you and give you a gracious release.But if you should desire Allah and His Messenger and the home of the Hereafter - then indeed, Allah has prepared for the doers of good among you a great reward."" Holy Quran 33:28-29. Prophet Muhammad(Peace be upon him) wives immediately repented and chosen the life of the Hereafter. I hope the facts presented here are sufficient to refute Claim no 1.
Michael H Hart has written a book called ""THE 100"". The list of 100 influential people who ever walked the face of the Earth and he mentions Prophet Muhammad(Peace be upon him) as the No. 1 influential person who ever walked the face of the Earth. Prophet Muhammad(Peace be upon him) led a simple life and he used to spend most of the days hungry for food and water. Some times he has to eat just a date palm for a day and some Honey. He doesn't have a fancy clothes to wear and no guards for his protection against Pagan Arabs and other tribes who were against his preaching.
Prophet Muhammad(Peace be upon him) used to milk his goat and clean his home and assist his wives in household work. Prophet Muhammad(Peace be upon him) even accepts the invitation from the poor people and used to eat what was provided to him. His enemy used to pass comments on him saying ""Oh he listen to Everybody"".
There was a time when Prophet Muhammad(Peace be upon him)'s son Ibrahim passed away and it coincide with the solar eclipse and people were telling that it was because of the death of Prophet Muhammad(Peace be upon him)'s son that we find heavens are too mourning.When Prophet Muhammad(Peace be upon him) listen to this, he immediately told the people that the Sun and the moon are the symbol of Allah and it does not coincide because of the death and birth of any human being. If Prophet Muhammad(Peace be upon him) wanted fame then he would have accepted that solar eclipse is due to his son demise but Prophet Muhammad(Peace be upon him) does not do that because he is a true Prophet(Peace be upon him) of Allah.
There is not even a single verse talking about the unity of the Arabs. In Holy Quran we have the concept of Ummah ie., The Nation. The nation which follows the rules set by the Allah Almighty through his glorious Holy Quran. Holy Quran talks about only the superiority of righteousness and there is no race or creed or nation or region or demographic are superior in the sight of Allah. Holy Quran says ""O mankind, indeed We have created you from male and female and made you peoples and tribes that you may know one another.
Indeed, the most noble of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous of you. Indeed, Allah is Knowing and Acquainted."" Holy Quran 49:13. We also have verses such as ""Say, [O Muhammad], ""If your fathers, your sons, your brothers, your wives, your relatives, wealth which you have obtained, commerce wherein you fear decline, and dwellings with which you are pleased are more beloved to you than Allah and His Messenger and jihad in His cause, then wait until Allah executes His command. And Allah does not guide the defiantly disobedient people."" Holy Quran 9:24 and also ""And hold firmly to the rope of Allah all together and do not become divided. And remember the favor of Allah upon you - when you were enemies and He brought your hearts together and you became, by His favor, brothers. And you were on the edge of a pit of the Fire, and He saved you from it.
Thus does Allah make clear to you His verses that you may be guided."" Holy Quran 3:103. If Prophet Muhammad(Peace be upon him) is the author of Holy Quran then why does it have such verses in it? Prophet Muhammad(Peace be upon him) is from Arab peninsula and he shouldn't be having such verses. Contrary to the Arab unity we also verses which talk Jews.""O Children of Israel, remember My favor that I have bestowed upon you and that I preferred you over the world's."" Holy Quran 2:47 and also ""And [mention] when the angels said, ""O Mary, indeed Allah has chosen you and purified you and chosen you above the women of the world's."" Holy Quran 3:40.Prophet Muhammad(Peace be upon him) is having his own wives and why does he choses Jewess for women above all nations?
Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon him) wrote the Holy Quran from the knowledge, experience and events without knowing that he is the author of the Holy Quran. No person who has the illusion can be constant throughout the period of 22 and half years. Once a group came to the Prophet Muhammad(Peace be upon him) to inquire about the Companions of the Cave. Prophet Muhammad(Peace be upon him) asked them to come tomorrow but the revelation did not come for next few days and Prophet Muhammad(Peace be upon him) was worried and after a gap of few days the revelation started again.
Many people accepted Islam during this period as it shown to them that Holy Quran is not the handy work of Prophet Muhammad(Peace be upon him). Holy Quran still has that verse ""And never say of anything, ""Indeed, I will do that tomorrow,Except [when adding], ""If Allah wills."" And remember your Lord when you forget [it] and say, ""Perhaps my Lord will guide me to what is nearer than this to right conduct."" Holy Quran 18:23-24. We can see this verse even today. Why that verse still exist today? If he is the author of the Holy Quran? The answer is,Prophet Muhammad(Peace be upon him) is not the author of the Holy Quran.
Orientalist say that Prophet Muhammad(Peace be upon him) learnt about Holy Quran from Roman Blacksmith from the outskirts of Mecca. But they fail to realize that Roman Blacksmith is a foreigner and this Holy Quran is a pure Arabic literature which Allah Almighty has send down from the heavens for all the mankind. It is also mention in the Holy Quran ""And We certainly know that they say, ""It is only a human being who teaches the Prophet."" The tongue of the one they refer to is foreign, and this Qur'an is [in] a clear Arabic language."" Holy Quran 16:103. They also claim that Prophet Muhammad(Peace be upon him) learnt it from Waraqah. Prophet Muhammad(Peace be upon him) has met him just twice in his lifetime. One time before the prophethood and the other time was after the prophethood when he was shivering out of fear after seeing Angel Jibrael.
The Holy Quran was continuously revealed to the heart of Prophet Muhammad(Peace be upon him) over the period of 22 and half years so it cannot be possible that he learnt it from Waraqah. They also claim that he learnt it from Jews and the Christian after migrating to Madhina and it took place after period of 13 years of revelation so that also cannot be possible. It was Prophet Muhammad(Peace be upon him) who was giving guidance to them not the vice versa. Many Christian and Jews embraced Islam during these discussion. They also claim that Prophet Muhammad(Peace be upon him) learnt it from others outside of Mecca Prophet Muhammad(Peace be upon him) went outside of Arabia just thrice in his lifetime.
One when he was 6 years old,travelled to Madhina and one when he was 9-11 years old, travelled to Syria and the third when he was 25 years old during the business expedition to Syria. It is absurd to say that he learnt whole of Holy Quran in just 3 occassion. Holy Quran clearly mentions that Prophet Muhammad(Peace be upon him) is unlettered meaning that he cannot read or write on his own. When the first revelation came to Prophet Muhammad(Peace be upon him) it was said to him ""Read.."", Prophet Muhammad(Peace be upon him) replied ""am not learned"". They also say that Holy Quran was copied from Holy Bible. Well, we agree that there is some similarities between them as the source of revelation for both is the same.The Almighty Allah.",en,books
"Defeats and Victories, but the War is over!
In our ongoing war with mold and moisture in our home we have had several battles in the past few weeks. Despite our efforts to air out our futons and frames daily, we found more green fuzzy mold on our wooden frames. Defeat! But we bought metal frames that sit about a foot and a half off the ground. This lifts our futons far enough off the ground that we haven't had any issues with condensation or mold growth. Victory! We also purchased a dehumidifier. After a few days of running it, the funny smell in Abbi and Ryli's room went away. Victory!! Success was sweet and it felt good to feel like we finally figured out how to deal with our mold and moisture problem. But all that changed last week. We pulled the curtains back in the girl's room and discovered the corner of the wooden window frame was black with mold and about half of the frame was moist to touch. Defeat! As we looked more closely around the house we discovered some other areas of concern related to excess moisture.
We have really loved this house but the concerns for our home seem more than what we can actually fix on our own. Our attitude has been to adapt and deal with new challenges but December 31st, we finally felt like God was saying it's time to move on.
With much help from our church and our organization, dialogues have started in regards to moving to another house in Rifu. We are not sure exactly what this process will look like yet, and this time could be one of anxiety, but really it is not. We have His peace that passes all understanding right now. We are sincere, we would be honest with you if it wasn't like this. But, we are truly excited, not just about a new home, but that we can see God at work. We are filled with a holy expectation of what He is doing and to see where He is taking us!",en,books
"Saudi Arabia must take immediate steps to end all discrimination against Women's rights's rightss rights's rights's rights's rights in the kingdom, Amnesty International said today following moves to give Women's rights's rightss rights's rights's rights's rights the right to vote.
King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia announced on Sunday that Women's rights's rightss rights's rights's rights's rights will have the right to vote and run in municipal elections, the kingdom’s only public poll, from 2015 and be appointed to the Shura Council, a body that advises the monarchy. However, under Saudi Arabia’s repressive laws, a woman is unable to travel, engage in paid work or higher education, or marry without the permission of a male guardian. Amnesty International Middle East and North Africa Deputy Director Philip Luther said: “It is a welcome, albeit limited, step along the long road towards gender equality in Saudi Arabia, and a testament to the long struggle of Women's rights's rightss rights's rights's rights's rights’s rights activists there. ""It is, however, much overdue and does not go nearly far enough. “The whole system of Women's rights's rightss rights's rights's rights's rights’s subordination to men in Saudi Arabia needs to be dismantled. “We can only hope that this announcement on voting will be the first in a long line of reforms that guarantee Saudi Women's rights's rightss rights's rights's rights's rights the rights that they have been demanding for so long.” Women's rights's rightss rights's rights's rights's rights are also still unable to legally drive in the kingdom. A high profile right to drive campaign launched by Saudi Women's rights's rightss rights's rights's rights's rights in June this year led to dozens of arrests. The Women's rights's rightss rights's rights's rights's rights were all released shortly afterwards, but only after being forced to sign a pledge that they would not drive again. Several are reported to be facing court cases. The concept of guardianship of men over Women's rights's rightss rights's rights's rights's rights, as applied in Saudi Arabia, severely limits Women's rights's rightss rights's rights's rights's rights’s rights in their private and public lives, In addition, Saudi Arabian Women's rights's rightss rights's rights's rights's rights married to foreign nationals cannot pass on their nationality to their Children's rights, unlike the case for Saudi Arabian men in a similar situation. Domestic violence against Women's rights's rightss rights's rights's rights's rights is reported to be rife in the country. “While moving in the right direction, Saudi Arabia is moving far too slowly. Ultimately, it is no great achievement to be one of the last countries in the world to grant Women's rights's rightss rights's rights's rights's rights the vote,” said Philip Luther.",en,incoherent
"On the 21st of July 1718, following the Passarowitz Treaty, Oltenia entered the Hapsburg Empire administration. The concept of “civilization impact” had not yet been invented, but the Germanic rigour, inhabitants’ legendary merry truancy and Ottomans’ bien-vivre lassitude represented nearly palpable collision factors. In 1738, the Empire retired after some failed attempts to take a census, a certain success acquired in mapping and earth “marking” with the first buildings – monasteries and manors – destined to survive in time.
The wine resembles every inch the story of Oltenia’s temporal Germanization. It’s difficult to fraternize the five varieties the wine is made of – Cabernet Sauvignon, Shiraz, Merlot, Pinot Noir and Dornfelder –, the more as they could seem to a rude connoisseur almost contradictory. Patiently, several hours after the bottle was opened – some pretend the following day would be even better! –, the flavours start working, revealing unexpected beauties difficult to guess at first nose. Discreet, almost subliminal notes appear and disappear among the rich nuances, leaving the “reader” surprised and out of the blue, feeling he/she is aware, but doesn’t know why, just like the “Germanic traces” the people making this wine preserved. Solid, but graceful and flexible, textured and silky, corpulent and smooth, lively but austere, an endless list of coherent contradictions, PASSAROWITZ 1718 is a wine to be drunk mindfully – it’s “the library wine” to be approached in front of a historical book or of an art album.",en,books

Edited: I can still login and post threads and replys but its annoying to login every time.
That's strange. I'm guessing you are using Tapatalk for Android, given your signature. I've just picked up my Android tablet, and it's working for me. I'm using WiFi (no LTE on this tablet) .
Hey Laura! This is pretty strange because it worked perfectly everyday since you told me I should try it and today its acting unusual. I could even have mobile hotspot on and it'll still ask me to login after the app has been exited.
I've used Tapatalk for Android on my Moto X today also, and I did not have any issues getting logged out on that device either. I'll see if tech will be able to investigate.
@Josiah23 - try uninstalling/installing the app and let me know if that helps. Have ran into this issue before and that seemed to work (for whatever reason!).
If not feel free to drop me a note direct and I'll look into it with you!

"If you are like me, your days are busy and you find yourself asking, “how can I get everything done today? There isn’t enough time.” Over the years I’ve learned how to find the balance between work and life. Here are the daily balance practices that have helped me the most.
That way if something should come up you can add it to your list or just move whatever is less important to later. Prioritize the list. The things that must get done TODAY should be done first. That way you are not stressing out at the end of the day. It will be easier to stay on task when a distraction occurs.
Pay bills, pick up daily essentials, make doctors appointment, dentist appointment, respond to emails, or return phone calls.
A book recommendation (which I read before writing this blog) – Be Happy Without Being Perfect, by Alice D. Domar. A great chapter was called “Tame Your To-Do List.” Here is a teaser, you must buy this book.
Make three lists: One of what MUST get done today (list A), one of what you would like to do (list B), and one of what has to be done eventually, but not immediately (list C). Alice D. Domar explains that your to-do lists already feels less intimidating, because the one list that really matters is list A. If you accomplish list A, you can move to List B and list C. If things come up during the day, add it to the necessary list.
She also says to be realistic with your scheduling. You can’t be expected to do everything in one day. Those around you, including yourself, shouldn’t have the expectation that you are going to do everything and do it perfectly.
Another great book is Getting Things Done by, David Allen. The book is about the art of stress-free productivity. It will teach you everything you need to know about work and life productivity and getting it all done without feeling overwhelmed.
When in the midst of feeling overwhelmed, stop and take three long breaths. This will help you come back to the present moment. When we are busy, we detach from the present (and from our bodies) and are only focusing on what we have to do next. This breathing exercise can be done anywhere and only takes a few minutes.
If your to-do list for the day has too many items, let go of a few activities. It’s more important to be happy and healthy than it is to get a few extra things done that can wait until the next day, or the next week.
At work and at home, get rid of the clutter. Your desk at work should have proper file folders, organizing gadgets, pens, paper, etc. Make sure everything is at your finger tips, so you are not always searching the office for those daily essentials. Clean your desk before you leave, so you come to a clean space in the morning. At home: keep everything you need daily in the same place so you are not wasting time searching. Make a menu for the week, and only buy those items when you do groceries. Knowing what you are going to make for the family when you get home will save precious time searching the cabinets and fridge, wondering what to make.
You don’t have to do it all. If you have children, get them to pitch in. Give your children simple chores and reward them for doing it. Sit down with your partner and make a list of chores/errands that you will divide between each other. Keep the list posted where everyone can see it. Do the same thing at work. Ask yourself, what am I doing that I could delegate to someone else? We often take on the task ourselves because we think it will be quicker. It might take more time in the beginning, when training someone, but overtime you will free up those timing-taking tasks that should not be on your plate.
Setting boundaries at work and in your personal life is so important. How often do you say yes to something that you already know you don’t the time for. Get rid of the guilt of saying no. You can phrase a no response in a positive way. For example: “I’m sorry. I can’t do this right now.” “Let me think about it and get back to you.” “I can’t do this, but I can do…” If someone asks me to do something on a day that I’m not available, or just really swamped, I will give them alternative dates. It makes them feel that I really do care and I’m not just brushing them off.
What can be done together? For example, making dinner & lunch: when making dinner, also prepare the lunches for the next day. One day a week, prepare several meals at once. Prepare meals that can be reheated or frozen for quick thaw. At work, think about similar tasks that can be bulked together. In the morning, I spend 1-hour responding to emails and the next hour returning phone calls. These two tasks are similar, they are responsive, so bulking them together forces me set aside the time in bulk instead of spreading them out throughout the day. Ask yourself, who do I need to call? Who do I need to email?What else can you group together for efficiency?
The simplest thing we can do, yet the hardest to ask for. Very simple, when I can’t do it all, I’m honest and ask for help. What areas of your life do you feel are overwhelming right now? Who can you reach out to for help? Maybe it is a family member, a coworkers, a friend, or even hiring a coach. I get many clients who are just looking for a way to create balance in their lives and they want me to help them create a life-plan.",en,web

"14 And David remained in the strongholds in the wilderness, in the hill country of the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him every day, but God did not give him into his hand.
24:1 When Saul returned from following the Philistines, he was told, “Behold, David is in the wilderness of Engedi.” 2 Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel and went to seek David and his men in front of the Wildgoats' Rocks. 3 And he came to the sheepfolds by the way, where there was a cave, and Saul went in to relieve himself. Now David and his men were sitting in the innermost parts of the cave. 4 And the men of David said to him, “Here is the day of which the Lord said to you, ‘Behold, I will give your enemy into your hand, and you shall do to him as it shall seem good to you.’” Then David arose and stealthily cut off a corner of Saul's robe. 5 And afterward David's heart struck him, because he had cut off a corner of Saul's robe. 6 He said to his men, “TheLord forbid that I should do this thing to my lord, the Lord's anointed, to put out my hand against him, seeing he is the Lord's anointed.” 7 So David persuaded his men with these words and did not permit them to attack Saul. And Saul rose up and left the cave and went on his way.
8 Afterward David also arose and went out of the cave, and called after Saul, “My lord the king!” And when Saul looked behind him, David bowed with his face to the earth and paid homage. 9 And David said to Saul, “Why do you listen to the words of men who say, ‘Behold, David seeks your harm’? 10 Behold, this day your eyes have seen how the Lord gave you today into my hand in the cave. And some told me to kill you, but I spared you. I said, ‘I will not put out my hand against my lord, for he is the Lord's anointed.’ 11 See, my father, see the corner of your robe in my hand. For by the fact that I cut off the corner of your robe and did not kill you, you may know and see that there is no wrong or treason in my hands. I have not sinned against you, though you hunt my life to take it.
16 As soon as David had finished speaking these words to Saul, Saul said, “Is this your voice, my son David?” And Saul lifted up his voice and wept. 17 He said to David, “You are more righteous than I, for you have repaid me good, whereas I have repaid you evil. 18 And you have declared this day how you have dealt well with me, in that you did not kill me when the Lord put me into your hands.19 For if a man finds his enemy, will he let him go away safe? So may the Lord reward you with good for what you have done to me this day. 20 And now, behold, I know that you shall surely be king, and that the kingdom of Israel shall be established in your hand. 21 Swear to me therefore by the Lord that you will not cut off my offspring after me, and that you will not destroy my name out of my father's house.” 22 And David swore this to Saul. Then Saul went home, but David and his men went up to the stronghold.
5:1 Then all the tribes of Israel came to David at Hebron and said, “Behold, we are your bone and flesh. 2 In times past, when Saul was king over us, it was you who led out and brought in Israel. And the Lord said to you, ‘You shall be shepherd of my people Israel, and you shall be prince over Israel.’” 3 So all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron, and King David made a covenant with them at Hebron before the Lord, and they anointed David king over Israel. 4 David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years. 5 At Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months, and at Jerusalem he reigned over all Israel and Judah thirty-three years.",en,books

"In August, the Kehlers held a one-day reunion in the Mitchell Arena, near Steinbach. Both physically and symbolically an arena is the proper place for a Kehler clan reunion.
I never knew my maternal grandfather Jacob K. Kehler, who died four years before I was born. And yet, I’ve often felt that he knew me, that he has lived inside me all these years, inspiring my love language, firing my bursts of imagination, shaping my temperament and slyly stimulating my fondness for verbal acrobatics and the telling of tall tales.
Why do I make this somewhat bizarre claim? Because the older I get the more strongly I can feel my immediate begetters, my parents and grandparents, wrapping themselves ever more tightly around my own identity–like those Russian (babushka) dolls that fit so snugly inside each other. And the more I think and learn about those begetters, the more intimate that feeling becomes. And the more richly satisfying the process of self-exploration becomes.
At the 1979 Berliner Kehler Family Reunion, Mitchell, Manitoba, the following comical Low-German poem about the eleven Kehler siblings was read by the poet Gustav Dueck, husband of Betty Stoesz Kehler.
Mr and Mrs Bill Kehler celebrated their 25th wedding anniversary at an open house Sunday, October 21, 1979. Approximately 200 relatives, friends and neighbours were present for the short program and luncheon.
They were presented with many lovely gifts and a sum of money. All of their children and grandchildren were present for the occasion.
Steinbach 42nd Annual Pioneer Days kicked off with the parade again this morning. Back in 1974, Randy Kehler, 8, son of Ben & Martha Kehler was the winner in the decorated bicycle competition.
Who doesn’t have a memory from the famous Edgar’s Diner? Today, on the 4th anniversary of his passing, we honour Edgar Stoesz Kehler, whose Berliner personality ignited conversation and laughter, and who loved to serve up a bowl of Borscht, a Husky Burger or a tasty veal cutlet.
It’s speculation perhaps, but if “Berliner” Kehler’s political favour rested within the boundaries of the Conservatives, how easily would he have crossed the room to support strong ties with that of his descendants?
In 1969, Ed Schreyer persuaded Elmer (Al) Reimer, 42, grandson of “Berliner” Kehler, to run in the La Verendrye riding, which included Steinbach. Al Reimer had respectable academic credentials, elevating NDP favour. While English Professor Al’s political career failed to get off the ground, his academic career was later deemed highly successful. This ad was found in The Carillon News, June 1969.

"Every year, the Dallas-Fort Worth Theater Critics Forum dishes out awards for best new play, best actor, best direction and myriad other theater categories. The group does not crown a winner in each category, nor does it declare a show of the year. Rather, the group gathers for a conversation about work that deserves special recognition.
On Saturday, September 7, the forum gathered to reflect on the 2012-13 season. This year, there were some clear favorites. On the Eve, the brand-new post-modern musical extravaganza, with songs and lyrics by the local band Home by Hovercraft, earned accolades for its writing, cast, music and director. (Theatre Three will remount this show in January 2014).
Kitchen Dog Theater had a standout season, with nearly every show receiving nominations for a design element or performance. There was also a unanimous desire to recognize the late Jerry Russell for his lifetime contributions to local theater and praise Fun House Theatre and Film for emerging as a stomping ground for young actors. In fact, Kennedy Waterman, an 11-year-old actress from Fun House, gave one of the best performances of the year for her role in Daffodil Girls.",en,web

"The year 2011 will be my 20th year composing strange music and releasing it mostly for free (previously I released on cassettes, now on the internet).
To mark this milestone, I kinda thought it’d be a fun thing to do to ask my comrades in underground music (whether you’re familiar with my music or not — whether we know each other or are not yet total BFFs) to extract sound samples from any of my releases over the last twenty years and tweak them however you like and re-assemble them into a musical work of your own invention. I’m looking less for “remixes” and more for imaginative and individual expressions made with collaged bits and chunks of my work (whether recognizable as such or not — in fact, manipulation, editing & effecting of source sounds is to be encouraged).
Most of my downloadable releases are CC licensed allowing derivative work, so you’re only limited by what you can think up. You can find links to almost everything I’ve ever done on my netlabel’s front page: http://vuzhmusic.com. A more comprehensive discography (including links to my work with Drone Forest) can be found on my bio page.
I haven’t yet decided if that threat is a joke or not.
Send me a link to where I can download the file when you’ve got one ready. My email address can be found at the contact link at the Vuzh Music website. You could also direct message me on Twitter, you can find me there as vuzhmusic.
Keep your track(s?) under 10 minutes in length.
Hoping to release in early 2011. Deadline maybe February 1??? EXTENDED to February 11.
Everything is negotiable, including this sentence.
Leave me a comment here if you want to participate… unless you like surprises, in which case just get the track to me before the deadline!
Guys! I’m already thinking of extending the deadline, and no one’s even asked me yet!
This sounds like a great project. I like to sample and re-construct better than I like to do “simple” tinker and re-loop remixes. I’ll enjoy sampling out sounds and then turning them into different sounds. Thanks for hosting this!
i do it..it will be another project to work on over the holiday break while i am away from my instruments.
Sounds exciting! I’ll try and find some time to do a liquid sphere remix.
That old project of mine needs to get out of sleep.
Excellent! It’ll be great to have another El Tafkeera alumnus on board!
i’ll be doing a keziah mason. track with some bits and bobbins.
I’ve got one underway based on Linguism 1. Should have it ready later today or tomorrow.
Give me a week or so C…I’ll have a track for you.
Martin! Awesome, glad to have you contribute. Look for an email from me, as I’ve been wanting to get in touch regarding “Nox”.
for you. Hopefully I’ll get some time over the year-end holidays!
Alright! The more the merrier! I’ve heard your project name before, but I don’t think we have ever had contact before.
Gosh I’m almost too late … but I’m going to give it a try!!! I’ll do my best to make the deadline!!!",en,web
"A drive along the Mosel River gets you into a quiet, romantic corner of Germany.
There are different ways to see this river... tours and river cruises.
We drove, so we'll tell you about that.
We recommend that after a day or so, you leave Frankfurt behind, and see the castles of the Rhine.
You're ready to round the corner to the Mosel River.
This area sprinkles smaller castles among romantic, peaceful villages and hillsides covered with vineyards.
If you approach it from the Rhine you will start near Koblenz. One of your first treats will be to get off into the mountains to see Burg Eltz (Eltz Castle).
Burg Eltz is about an hour from the Rhine River.
It's between Koblenz and the Mosel town of Cochem.
Your drive will take you off the main road and wind up a narrow road to a parking lot.
From there take a shuttle or walk to the castle.
It has been left intact for 700 years, never having been destroyed.
It is furnished as it was in the Middle Ages and is still owned by the Eltz family.
A tour of the castle takes about 45 minutes and is well worth it.
There are English as well as German tours.
How Often Can We Say Cute Little Towns?
This is the first little town of size that you come to as you drive south. Cochem is a picturesque town and a tourist hub.
You can easily find hotels, B&Bs (Zimmers in German) and restaurants. The old quarter is dominated by its 1000 year old castle, which can be toured.
The town itself is dotted with restored timber framed houses.
Beilstein is one of the quaintest of all Mosel River towns. It has narrow lanes and yet another ruined castle.
Along the river, you're sure to see swans... be sure not to invade their territory; they will probably try to chase you off.
Zell is a peaceful town with a fine riverside promenade.
It has plenty of wine bars, restaurants and Zimmers.
And got the photo, so we include it as another town on your drive south.
The town of Bernkastel is over 700 years old. It is on the middle Mosel.
In a valley full of wine towns, this little village stands out.
Half-timbered buildings dating from the early 17th century surround its old Marktplatz.
It is 30 miles (48 km) from Trier.
The legendary (among wine aficionados) Bernkasteler Doctor Vineyard is located along the Mosel above the town of Bernkastel.
It is one of Germany's most famous and expensive wines.
This part of Germany is known for it's Rieslings, but there are other wines available.
There are small hotels in most of the towns, but this is a great area to just look for one of those ""Zimmer Frei"" signs and stay with a family.
Pick the right place, and they might even make their own wine.... and let you sample it.
They'll feed you a great German breakfast and give you tips on where to have lunch and dinner.
You may have a quiet balcony to sit on and look at the swans float by on the river... and really unwind, which is what a holiday is all about..., isn't it?
Quaint, Picturesque, Cute - Too Much?
If you're getting the idea that all the little towns and villages along the Mosel River are quaint and picturesque... you're absolutely right.
And enjoy. You'll be using all those superlatives too.",en,books
"Well, the most obvious change is the paint job. I liked the look of white and red (like on old wood gas stations- so I decided to give it a shot. Changing the colors of a kit is one of the easiest ways to make a kit ""your own."" Try it out!
I ended up finishing most of the model and really liking the embankment behind the grill and the billboard. If I added track though the ballast would likely eliminate the change of elevation. I used to do a lot of track walking and usually there is a drainage ditch between the tracks and whatever is beside the right of way. So, I added another inch and half strip to the base. Thus I ended up with my ""hobo highway."" Changes in elevation almost always add a lot to a model. This is especially true in urban modeling where things can get very flat and thus a little boring. Try adding anything you can think of to add a little depth. This, by the way, brings the finished base to 10"" x 11.5"".
The patches in the street were a last minute fix (the best effects usually come by accident!). I touched the street and left some fingerprints in the charcoal I used for weathering. So, I just painted over the prints with Floquil's Aged Concrete and then very lightly re-weathered the patches.
You may have noticed I used a steel fence instead of the wooden fence supplied for the railing by the parking lot. Variation is a good thing. I figured since I already had a wood fence in back, I'd switch things up a bit. It is by Pola. The fence in the back is board-by-board and I originally thought of using a Central Valley plastic fence to save time. I'm glad I didn't! The fence came out very nice and with a little weathering and a poster here and there ended up looking great.
The billboard was tough (for me)- take your time.... I switched the sign for an old FSM sign I had. I very lightly sanded the front of the sign with 440 grit wet/dry sandpaper to give a faded look. There are many many signs on the diorama and all have been sanded very thin on the back and then lightly on the front.
The stucco addition was another change from the kit. After reading through the directions I was a little skeptical about having gaps around the window after mounting it backwards. So, I put in in like a regular window and since I don't like decals I scrapped the EAT decal and went with some old signs and posters. There are two Ringling Bros. posters- a new one over the old one.
The lot was supposed to be gravel- I went with real dirt. I then added chalks and a little dry brushing to get some variation. I didn't want to put weeds over the whole wall to hide the seam, so I added some small rocks and old newspapers. Most of the foliage is Woodland Scenics. I mainly used two colors, but I mixed them together first and after they were glued down I hit them with dabs of black alcohol and ink stain.
For the rest of the diorama two grades of dirt were used: a very fine powder and a rocky blend. (Sounds like coffee huh?) There are little patches of grass that are Sweetwater products. I really like them.
I added some extra castings here and there, especially around the trash corral. There's also a good buildup of old boards, a tire and some misc. junk. There were additional details that were meant for the back, but because of my drainage ditch I kept them and instead used some old crates and pallets and other junk.
The roof has a lot of patches, as it is quite old. The patches are pieces of the roofing paper cut to size. A cool detail here is to take a sewing needle or very fine pin and make nail-hole marks around the edges of your patches. This looks great!
Everything was weathered by drybrushing with white paint. The main building was hit with a very light stain of black india ink/alcohol mix. I learned quickly (luckily on a piece of scrapwood- always test first!) that my usual ink stain was too dark on white paint. So I thinned it out a lot. Floquil Rust was used in a lot of places as well as weathering chalks.
One other big change was in the carving of the sidewalk. I thought the squares were too big in the plans, so I made my own smaller squares. I then used a dull x-acto knife to carve in lots of cracks.
Here is an invaluable tip: if you want a figure inside, which I assume you will, put him in before finishing the diorama! Don't ask. We'll just say it took a lot of effort to get Lou in there after I was done with everything else! Another tip is to read the instructions very carefully when you add the kitchen wall inside. It needs to be just right to line up the roof section above it. I'd recommend test fitting the roof piece over the kitchen wall before gluing the wall in.",en,books
"The Prodigal son (cf. Lk 15:11-32).
The doctrine of sin is central to Christianity, since its basic message is about redemption in Christ. Christian hamartiology describes sin as an act of offence against God by despising his persons and Christian biblical law, and by injuring others. In Christian views it was an evil human act, which violates the rational nature of man as well as God's nature and his eternal law. According to the classical definition of St. Augustine of Hippo sin is ""a word, deed, or desire in opposition to the eternal law of God.""
Among some scholars, sin is understood mostly as legal infraction or contract violation of non-binding philosophical frameworks and perspectives of Christian ethics, and so salvation tends to be viewed in legal terms (see Judaism and Christianity#Sin for a comparison).
The way Thomas Aquinas viewed sin and vices was radically different from later approaches, especially that of 17th century moral theology. He presented sin and vices as contraries of virtues. He discusses the subject in his Summa Theologica part Ia-IIae (Prima secundae) qq.71-89.
According to Aquinas the gravity of sin depends also on some disposition of the agent (cf. STh I-II q. 18, aa. 4, 6). Sin, venial by reason of its object, may become mortal. It happens when person fixes his/her ultimate happiness, the last end of his/her life (Lat. finis ultimus) in the object of that venial sin. When venial sin is used as a way to provoke mortal sin it becomes mortal as well, e.g. when someone uses empty conversation or a chat to seduce someone to commit adultery. Also sin, mortal by reason of its object, may become venial because of the agent's disposition when his/her evil act does not have full moral capacity, i.e. is not deliberated by reason. That may happen for instance when sudden movements of unbelief arise in the mind. (Cf. STh I-II q.72 a.5).
According to another formulation of the concept of sin in the Summa, at the heart of sin is ""the turning away from the immutable good"", i.e. God, and ""inordinate turning to mutable good"", i.e. creatures. (STh I-IIae q.87 a.4) This cannot be understood as if in the concrete sinful deed the sinner commits two separate and independent acts. Both aversio and conversio constitute one single guilty action. At the root of the inordinate turning to the creatures is self-love which expresses itself in disordered desire (cupiditas) and rebellion towards God (superbia).
Speaking about sloth (Lat. acedia) Thomas points out that every deed which ""by its very nature is contrary to charity is a mortal sin"". An effect of such deed is the destruction of ""spiritual life which is the effect of charity, whereby God dwells in us."" Sin of a mortal character is always committed with the consent of reason: ""Because the consummation of sin is in the consent of reason""'. (cf. STh II-IIae q.35 a.3) Venial and mortal sins can be compared to sickness and death. While venial sin impairs full healthy activity of a person, mortal sin destroys the principle of spiritual life in him/her.
Many Protestants of a Calvinist orientation teach that, due to original sin, humanity has lost any and all capacity to move towards reconciliation with God (Romans 3:23;6:23; Ephesians 2:1-3); in fact, this inborn sin turns humans away from God and towards themselves and their own desires (Isaiah 53:6a). Thus, humans may be brought back into a relationship with God only by way of God's rescuing the sinner from his/her hopeless condition (Galatians 5:17-21; Ephesians 2:4-10) through Jesus' substitutionary atonement (Romans 5:6-8; Colossians 2:13-15; 1 Timothy 2:5-6). According to traditional Reformed theology and classical Lutheranism, Salvation is sola fide (by faith alone); sola gratia (by grace alone); and is begun and completed by God alone through Jesus (Ephesians 2:8,9). This understanding of original sin (Romans 5:12-19), is most closely associated with Calvinist doctrine (see total depravity) and Lutheranism. Calvinism allows for the relative or nominal ""goodness"" of humanity through God's common grace upon both those predestined to salvation and those predestined to damnation, upon the regenerate and the unregenerate. Methodist Arminian theology adapts the concept by stating that humans, entirely sinful and totally depraved, can only ""do good"" through God's prevenient grace.
Arminianism has traditionally taught what is known as the governmental theory of atonement. Drawing primarily from the works of Jacobus Arminius and especially Hugo Grotius, the governmental theory teaches that Christ suffered for humankind so that God could forgive humans while still maintaining divine justice. Unlike the traditional Reformed perspective, this view states that Christ was not punished by God the Father in the place of sinners, for true forgiveness would not be possible if humankind's offenses were already punished. Christ's suffering was a real and meaningful substitutionary atonement for the punishment humans deserve, but Christ was not punished on behalf of some or all of the human race. This view has prospered in traditional Methodism and all who follow the teachings of John Wesley, and has been detailed by, among others, 19th century Methodist theologian John Miley in his Atonement in Christ and 20th century Church of the Nazarene theologian J. Kenneth Grider in his Wesleyan-Holiness Theology. Variations of this view have also been espoused by 18th century Puritan Jonathan Edwards and 19th century revival leader Charles Grandison Finney.
Mary Baker Eddy, founder of the Christian Science movement, taught that atonement exemplifies our underlying spiritual unity with God, whereby we reflect divine Love (God): Christ's atonement reconciles man to God, not God to man.

"I should move to London. In the long run, it would be best if I moved to London. Madness you might think bare in mind I have a great job that I love in Bristol and have wonderful friends here and there is cider. Not the mass market stuff but proper West Country cider, the type that will make you forget your own name and start fights.
So why should I move to London- well I have an awesome group of friends, who I go travelling with (who helped me eat my way around San Sebastian and other spots around the world) and generally have a fantastic time with? Seriously, we could be in a field in the middle of nowhere with nothing and still have a great time. Right, gush over. And it so happens all our birthdays are nicely spread out across the year and roughly one a month. Which entails I get to go and try the cool spots in the big smoke is where all of them live except me.
This weekend in the middle of moving flats (the reason for no new cooking posts just reviews), it was one of these great friends birthdays- Bernard – not her real name….don’t ask. Like the flouncy ladies that we are, we donned our finery and went for Not Afternoon Tea, Afternoon Tea at the Oxo Tower on the South Bank.
What is Not Afternoon Tea, Afternoon Tea, I hear you cry, well its fancy afternoon tea of delicious dessert plates and alcohol! There are four different theme plates to choose from all with complimentary cocktails. And what also compliments the desserts and the cocktails are the views, which are stunning! From the South Bank, you can see across the Thames to St. Paul’s, the Gherkin and the rest of London.
– Yoghurt sorbet with black strawberry balsamic pearls – really fresh tasting sorbet, creamy texture which some yoghurt based desserts lack the body needed. The pearls had a lot of flavours but the texture of hard tapioca balls, not unpleasant but did add the difference to the smooth sorbet.
– Lemon Jazz – this little sponge had a little texture with zesty lemon and studded with tiny chocolate studs, not big enough to detract from the freshness of the sponge but compliments. Also was topped with a lemon curd and white chocolate truffle. Yum.
For £22.50 each, it was well worth trying some different desserts and the presentation was top notch. I think I would go back to try their full lunchtime menu and have one of their puddings as we did then go on to somewhere else for dinner as needed something to go with the many bottles of prosecco. Highly recommended though and will be going back soon.
Below are the other dessert plates the other ladies picked.
Those desserts look so good!
I love the Oxo tower, but haven’t been for ages. That afternoon tea looks and sound amazing – more than enough reason to return!
I must give a shout out to my friend May who made that delicious dessert for you working at the oxo is as much fun as dining at the oxo. Working there was hard but its worth it in the end May works her but off every day and is such a amazing pastry chef.",en,web

"Amazing Car Windshield Crack Repair.
We've tested the windshield repair kit, and it worked quite well on rock chips and bullseyes that can obscure your vision and make your windshield look junky. You can buy one of these kits anywhere, and they're actually a simpler version (and much cheaper) of professional kits sold to real shops. Follow these directions and tips from experience, you'll have a repaired windshield in no time.
It's important to know what you can do and what you can't do with a kit like this.
They work great on chips, but anything with a running crack is a bigger challenge. We had little to no luck repairing a crack with the kit, even though they claim it works, and provide instruction in how to do it. We just couldn't get it to look right despite a number of attempts. But for chips and bullseyes it was amazing.
To see before and after photos, check out our initial review of the windshield repair kit.

X-linked intellectual disability (XLID) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorder. During the past two decades in excess of 100 X-chromosome ID genes have been identified. Yet, a large number of families mapping to the X-chromosome remained unresolved suggesting that more XLID genes or loci are yet to be identified. Here, we have investigated 405 unresolved families with XLID. We employed massively parallel sequencing of all X-chromosome exons in the index males. The majority of these males were previously tested negative for copy number variations and for mutations in a subset of known XLID genes by Sanger sequencing. In total, 745 X-chromosomal genes were screened. After stringent filtering, a total of 1297 non-recurrent exonic variants remained for prioritization. Co-segregation analysis of potential clinically relevant changes revealed that 80 families (20%) carried pathogenic variants in established XLID genes. In 19 families, we detected likely causative protein truncating and missense variants in 7 novel and validated XLID genes (CLCN4, CNKSR2, FRMPD4, KLHL15, LAS1L, RLIM and USP27X) and potentially deleterious variants in 2 novel candidate XLID genes (CDK16 and TAF1). We show that the CLCN4 and CNKSR2 variants impair protein functions as indicated by electrophysiological studies and altered differentiation of cultured primary neurons from Clcn4(-/-) mice or after mRNA knock-down. The newly identified and candidate XLID proteins belong to pathways and networks with established roles in cognitive function and intellectual disability in particular. We suggest that systematic sequencing of all X-chromosomal genes in a cohort of patients with genetic evidence for X-chromosome locus involvement may resolve up to 58% of Fragile X-negative cases.
Apparently pathogenic CLCN4 mutations identified in the screen and functional analysis of the missense variants. (a) Pedigrees of families with CLCN4 likely pathogenic mutations. Individuals tested for co-segregation with X-linked intellectual disability (XLID) and the results are indicated, *=mutation carrier, wt=subject does not carry the mutation. (b) Current–voltage relationships of the electrogenic Cl−/H+ exchanger protein ClC-4 and its mutants expressed in Xenopus oocytes, shown as mean values of normalized steady-state currents from several oocytes (numbers indicated in figure, in parentheses: number of frogs). Compared with the strongly outwardly-rectifying currents of wild-type ClC-4,, currents were much smaller or even absent with CIC-4 mutant proteins carrying p.Gly78Ser, p.Leu221Val, p.Val536Met and p.Gly731Arg substitutions. ctr, non-injected controls; error bars, s.e.m. Two-tailed t-test was used for statistical comparisons (**P<0.01, ***P<0.001 compared with wild-type ClC-4 currents). (c) Analogous positions of amino acids mutated in ClC-4 highlighted in the crystal structure of CmClC. Amino acids are displayed as spheres in colors like in (b). The small green spheres represent Cl− ions. CLC transporters form dimers of identical subunits (shown in different shades) and include a transmembrane domain (TMD) and two cytosolic cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS) domains.
Pedigrees of families with co-segregating truncating and missense variants in novel and previously suggested candidate X-linked intellectual disability (XLID) genes validated through this study. (a) In the postsynaptic density protein CNKSR2, we observed a protein truncating variant in family P180. (b) In FRMPD4, we detected a unique protein truncating variant in family P58 with five affected males. (c) In KLHL15, we identified a protein truncating variant in family D60 with eight affected males. (d) In LAS1L, we found unique missense variants in families MRXS6 (ref. ) and T50, both with Wilson-Turner (WTS) syndrome. (e) In RLIM, we identified missense variants in three large families D72, T11 and AU31. (f) In USPX27, we found a protein truncating variant in family D177 and a missense variant in family L75. (g) In the novel candidate XLID gene CDK16, we detected a protein truncating variant in family L56. (h) In the novel candidate XLID gene TAF1, we identified missense variants in families D185 and N67. *=mutation carrier, wt=wild type.
Effects of Clcn4 or Cnksr2 downregulation on morphology of mouse hippocampal neurons. Typical arborization of GFP-labeled neurons cultured for 18 days in vitro (DIV) after targeting by non-silencing (NS) or gene-specific shRNA (Clcn4 or Cnksr2) at 11 DIV. Quantification of transfected neurons, for total length of neuritic branches, total number of branches (a branch is considered as the segment between two branching points) and for dendritic branching complexity (levels were quantified per neuron from 1 to 6, each time a branching point is met from nucleus toward the distal part of each dendrite). Detection of co-transfections of shRNA and cDNA encoding plasmids for rescue experiments is shown as overlap of GFP (green) and Halotag (red) signals. Clcn4 experiment is shown in (a) and Cnksr2 in (c). More than 15 representative cells of each type were analyzed per experiment, with three independent experiments conducted. (b) Quantification of neuritic arborization in GFP expressing primary hippocampal neurons derived from Clcn4+/+ and Clcn4−/− mice as described above. Two independent experiments with>30 cells per genotype of five wild-type and four knock-out mice were analyzed. ClC-4-deficient neurons showed a significant reduction in the total number and total length of neuritic branches compared with wild-type cells. Average values with s.e.m. are shown (i) in histograms for neuritic length and number of branches and (ii) in curves for complexity levels of branching. Mann-Whitney and Chi2 tests were respectively used for statistical comparisons (ns: non-statistically significant, *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001). Scale bar represents 10 μm.
Novel X-linked intellectual disability (XLID) genes and candidates that emerged from this study encode components of key cellular protein networks. All available protein–protein interactions involving known intellectual disability (ID) proteins and the proteins likely implicated in XLID identified in this study were first extracted from the literature and then connected into a set of protein–protein interaction networks via the Ingenuity tool. Functional cellular subnetworks were extracted by using the available annotations of the interacting proteins (e.g., defined by functional category ‘translation/transcription') and by performing literature searches. (a) PSD-95 (postsynaptic density protein 95)/Ras/Rho interaction network. CNKSR2 (CNK2, MAGUIN1, validated XLID protein) that likely functions as an adapter protein or regulator of Ras signaling pathways interacts with PSD-95 in synaptosomes. FRMPD4 (Preso, validated XLID protein), which is a positive regulator of dendritic spine morphogenesis and density and is required for the maintenance of excitatory synaptic transmission, interacts with PSD-95, and together with its binding partner ARHGEF7 (βPix) localizes in dendritic growth cones. (b) Transcriptional/translational interaction network. Known protein complexes are highlighted. RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII) complex with the core component TAF1 (novel candidate XLID protein). ATN1 (known ID protein) interacts with TAF4 and negatively regulates transcription of RNAPII. Large ribosomal subunit (60S) contains RPL10 (known candidate XLID/autism protein). LAS1L (novel XLID protein) is essential for the biogenesis of the ribosomal subunit 60S. Eukaryotic translation initiation factor, EIF2S3 (novel XLID protein), is a component of the translation initiation complex and promotes binding of the initiator methionyl-tRNA to the 40S ribosomal subunit. POLDIP3 (SKAR), involved in positive regulation of translation, associates with THOC2 (novel XLID protein) as a part of the TREX complex (functioning in mRNA export), with mRNA surveillance factor UPF3B (known XLID protein), as well as with a core component of the exon junction complex, EIF4A3. CDK16 (novel candidate XLID protein) and Synapsin 1 (Syn1, known XLID protein) were shown to interact in a membrane fraction from brain. Cdk16 associates with 14-3-3 zeta in Neuro-2A cells. Mediator complex, which functions as a transcriptional coactivator, contains MED12 (known XLID protein) and MED13L (known ID protein). NIPBL (known ID protein) is involved in loading of cohesin and associates with the mediator-cohesin complex, which interfaces gene expression and chromatin structure. Histone methyltransferase MLL2 (known ID protein) associates with a core component of Pol II, POLR2B, and activates transcription. Deubiquitinating enzyme USP27X (novel XLID protein) interacts with USP22 that is required for histone deubiquitination, and which associates together with TAF10 as part of the TBP-free TAF complex (TFTC). ADRA2B, G-protein coupled receptor, by interacting with EIF2B and 14-3-3 zeta links G protein-mediated signaling network and cellular control of protein synthesis. (c) Ubiquitination interaction network. KLHL15 (validated XLID protein) with a function in protein ubiquitination interacts with a component of an ubiquitin E3 ligase, CUL3. RLIM (novel XLID protein) is an E3 ubiquitin protein ligase and associates with UBE2D1.",en,academic
"First Attempts In Learning – CONNECT!
I used to think exclusively in black and white.
I have a sincere appreciation for the clear-cut, precise and absolute and have argued that those who are not 100% sure of their accuracy should not be entitled to an opinion. I have spent most of my life infuriated by indecisiveness and I cringe to acknowledge that I have stormed off in irritation at people who would answer questions with questions instead of concrete opinions. I have been an equally harsh critic of my own confusion and have been guilty of rushing a process in order to arrive at a conclusion I could stand behind.
Recently, my thinking has changed.
At a conference last week, when I was asked to choose an object to represent myself, I chose colored crayons. “Black and white are too singular, there just isn’t enough room for progression in them,” I reasoned, “you’ve got to have room for the process when you’re learning. You’ve got to be able to make use of all those colors and their ability to blend, to mask and to complement.” What I am recognizing is that absolutes are finite where learning is infinite and if you are open to it, then you can never be finished with it.
I have recognized for a while now that feedback is necessary to the learning process. What I have recognized recently is that it can be a tough reality check when you are at your most excited; it is difficult to believe you have perfected a drawing, only to discover that your red needs to deepen to purple.
As a society, we so rarely celebrate those moments in which we realize that our learning has hit a roadblock, that we are at risk of avoiding them entirely as we do not effectively value their worth. My first reaction to critical feedback is to defend myself. Why? I’m not sure. Maybe because I have been conditioned to see this feedback as critique of my ability and self worth? After all, traditional education has effectively perpetuated a grading system in which academic standards are an implement with which we are encouraged to measure ourselves.
The beauty of inquiry is that this trouble becomes an advantage as it adds to, conflicts with, redirects or refocuses what you already know and you, ultimately, become more colorful for it.
about how we celebrate great scientists but often forget that they spent years failing or had countless other crazy theories that weren't true (Newton and Alchemy). Being so answer/discovery based in science education means we don't prepare students for what science is. We also give a false sense that smart people get the right answer and dumb people get the wrong answer. Smart people are the ones who keep trying after they get the wrong answer.
I just finished listening to the episode of the “This American Life” you shared. It was so good! I don't think I'd really considered this aspect of work in science or how we approach it, even as I wrote about failure. It has been enlightening for all of our students to more actively consider the value of failure in math and science. Their learning has definitely accelerated as they become less fearful of “wrong answers”. The last line of your comment is a brilliant one.",en,books

"North Kelvinside originated as a small mid-Victorian suburb developed on land previously occupied by manor-houses and working mills situated on the north bank of the River Kelvin in Glasgow’s west end. The district was bounded to the north by the Forth and Clyde Canal and to the south by the River Kelvin.
A prominent feature of the area is the massive retaining wall and associated ""Sixty Steps"" erected by John Ewing Walker in 1869-1870, prior to the laying out of the suburb.
The map below dates from 1795, long before development had commenced on this part of the river. It shows the large houses on the north bank: Kelvinside House, occupied by Dr Thomas Lithan and North Woodside House occupied by Mr Benjamin Barton. The manor houses and their grounds covered the section of the river which currently lies between Botanic Crescent and Belmont Street.
Dr. Thomas Lithan had acquired Kelvinside House and the surrounding estate in 1785. Ownership passed on to his widow after his death in 1807.
The last occupant of the house was Mr Matthew Montgomerie who died there on 17th June 1868.
The mansion house and the surrounding ninety acres were then sold to Mr. John Ewing Walker for development.
The new suburb was originally referred to as ""Kelvinside"", a name which is now used for a completely different neighbourhood in the west end.
Development commenced in 1869 after a large portion of the old estate of North Woodside, at the eastern side of the proposed suburb had been acquired by the City of Glasgow Bank and the grounds attached to Kelvinside House on the western side had come into the ownership of local businessman, John Ewing Walker. Significantly Walker had also acquired a long narrow plot of land along the riverbank which had become detached from the lands of North Woodside in 1771.
On 11th October 1869 the Glasgow Herald commented on the erection by Mr Walker of a ""formidable stone dyke"" on the northern side of his new Queen Margaret Bridge which was also under construction at the time. This massive barrier was intended to replace the existing march (or boundary) wall between the two estates.
Commercial advantage, rather than any aesthetic considerations was the main factor in Walker's erection of this barricade, designed to spoil access to any parts of the new suburb not situated on his land.
The Glasgow Herald of 20th October 1870 reported on the animosity, describing the situation as an “unhappy misunderstanding”.
Commenting on the two roads at different levels, the same paper remarked that ""Both roadways are of the best description, and it is therefore the more unfortunate that they are divorced from each other""
The above map from 1822 shows that at that time there was a single road connecting Kelvinside House with North Woodside House and other areas on the north bank of the Kelvin. There was never any need for two roads at different levels separated by an unnecessary wall and stairway.
This is confirmed by the view shown below of the relatively flat wooded riverside west of North Woodside House where the huge wall would later be erected on the site of the square Italianate villa to the left of the sketch. This house was built on a narrow strip of land forming a wooded terrace overlooking the river.
This sketch of the houses at North Woodside was prepared by Andrew McGeorge of the Regality Club, who visited both houses shortly before their demolition.
The mansion house of the estate of North Woodside was the three storey house at the bend of the river to the right of the sketch.
When this house was acquired in 1790 by Benjamin Barton, it was described in the conveyance as ""that part of the lands of Northwoodside called the Glebe, with the mansion house of Northwoodside and other houses standing thereon”. Mr. Barton possessed this house until his death at the end of 1816, after which it was sold to John Hamilton of Northpark. This part of the estate was eventually acquired by the City of Glasgow Bank.
John E. Walker had strategically acquired the site of the Italianate villa which had been built by William Gillespie and his son Colin around 1802. This long narrow plot had been detached from the ""land of old extent of Northwoodside"" in 1771, when it was purchased by William Fleming.
Walker used the site of the villa and surrounding terrace to create his massive obstruction, blocking access to North Woodside from the west.
Confusingly, the map above and other published sources refer to both Gillespie's villa and Benjamin Barton's mansion as ""North Woodside House"", hence the contradictory reports regarding ownership and dates.
Both Mr Walker and the City of Glasgow Bank erected bridges across the Kelvin to provide access from Great Western Road to their parts of the neighbourhood. These bridges were completed in 1870.
Near the site of North Woodside House, the City of Glasgow Bank erected Belmont Bridge, which linked their disconnected lands consisting of 16 acres on the north bank and 12 acres on the south bank, shown in Andrew MacGeorge's sketch.
The original Queen Margaret Bridge was erected by Mr Walker, who owned 100 acres to the west of the site including the grounds of Kelvinside House. He also had a long narrow strip of land along the riverbank, much of which is now part of the Kelvin Walkway.
The view below shows the distant housing developments on the south bank of the Kelvin at a considerably higher level than the ill-chosen crossing point for Walker's bridge, which was carefully selected to ensure his ascendancy on the northern side of the river.
Mr Walker commissioned the construction of the bridge and the massive retaining wall at its northern end. He appointed local civil engineer, Mr Ritchie Rodger, to design and co-ordinate the construction of the bridge and the wall, which were both erected in 1869-1870. The cast iron bridge, supported by substantial stone piers, was constructed by John McElroy & Sons, builders and founders.
Extract from Glasgow Herald, 20th October 1870 and plaque with Glasgow's coat of arms attached to bridge.
Ritchie Rodger lived locally at 194 Dumbarton Road, Partick. His civil engineering practice operated from 37 West George Street in the city centre.
The original Queen Margaret Bridge was designed in a rather primitive style as a trabeated structure requiring huge vertical supports to carry a relatively narrow roadway. Trabeated bridges constructed with traditional materials are suitable only for very short spans and require supporting masonry on a massive scale reminiscent of megalithic construction.
The stunted remains of the central pier, shown in the foreground (below) demonstrates the thickness of the stonework specified by Ritchie Rodger for Walker's civil engineering works. The bridge's south pier in the background was left intact and is still standing.
Walker's bridge was situated to the east of the present day Queen Margaret Bridge and terminated at his unsightly fortification which had been put up in order to provide an impenetrable barrier between his land and that of the City of Glasgow Bank.
The stone used for the bridge supports is identical to that used for the adjacent retaining wall.
The original Queen Margaret Bridge, was in an awkward position, crossing low over the river and ending abruptly at the wall. It was replaced by the present bridge in 1929.
The construction of a replacement bridge across the Kelvin at Queen Margaret Drive was sanctioned by Glasgow Corporation on 12th August 1926, with the placing of a contract for £73,000. The Parliamentary powers to build the bridge at this site had been obtained as far back as 1914.
In contrast to the original trabeated bridge with its massive stone supports the new Queen Margaret Bridge was constructed with the aid of reinforced concrete as a single arched span capable of carrying the wide new carriageway of Queen Margaret Drive over the Kelvin.
The object was to provide better communications for the north-western part of the city with Partick and the surrounding riverside districts where many people were employed.
There had been a great desire have public transport connections from Byres Road across the Kelvin, giving direct access to Maryhill and its neighbouring districts. This was impossible to achieve with the low-lying Walker's bridge, which literally hit a stone wall preventing access to the wider area. The less costly option of reconstructing the original bridge had been considered by the Corporation, but was rejected as impractical.
In September 1929, after the new bridge was brought into use, it was decided to close Walker's bridge to all vehicular traffic.
The new bridge retained the name of ""Queen Margaret Bridge"", rather than the suggested ""Garrioch Bridge"" in the above article.
Walker's bridge was made redundant with the erection of the new bridge crossing high above the Kelvin at a sensible level which allowed ready access from Byres Road to the all the suburbs in the north-west of the city.
This early twentieth century rainy view from the south side of the original bridge shows red sandstone tenements on Walker's land to the left, on the same level as the crossing. His rival's earlier development can be seen to the right, sitting high above the dead wall with no easy access from the bridge.
The present day photograph shown below demonstrates the scale of the access problem.
Walker was a coach proprietor and wanted to maximise the benefits of the new carriageways to suit the development of his part of the site. He deliberately made it as difficult as possible for horse drawn traffic crossing his bridge to access his rival’s land, which could only be reached on foot by climbing a very steep set of stairs at the western edge of the wall.
Walker ensured that the roads were not continuous or on the same levels between the two parcels of land.
A modern plaque has been attached to the retaining wall attributing it to Alexander ""Greek"" Thomson, 1872, labelling the adjacent stairway as the ""Sixty Steps"".
This is contradicted by the published contemporary evidence, which shows that the wall and associated stairs were an integral part of John E. Walker's civil engineering works of 1869-1870 to the designs of Ritchie Rodger C.E.
Thomson was an architect rather than an engineer and was vice-president of the Glasgow Institute of Architects in 1869-1870, the period when the structural work was being undertaken. If he had any involvement it would almost certainly have been authenticated by the newspaper articles of the time, but it is not.
There are no nineteenth century sources linking any of the complex civil engineering works at this location to Alexander Thomson, who would never have been complicit in Walker's spiteful scheme.
The staircase appears to have been a free standing structure tagged on to the end of Walker's wall. The flat area of land to the west of the wall and the steps was left undeveloped until the red sandstone tenement was built at the foot of the stairway around 1900. This was long after Walker's death in September 1875.
Before the erection of the block shown below, which could be directly accessed at street level, there would have been a sheer drop from the side of the staircase down to the level ground owned by Walker. The stunted remains of the protective iron railings can still be seen.
Having successfully isolated and secured very limited access to his rivals' land, Walker was in no hurry to commence development on his own part of the site, preferring the area around Kelvinside House to the west of Queen Margaret Drive, where plots were offered for sale through his preferred architects of the time, Messrs Haig & Low of 94 West Regent Street, Glasgow.
The notice, below, from the Glasgow Herald, 20th May 1872, offers land for feuing for villas, terraces and tenements in what was then described as ""Kelvinside New Suburb"".
To embellish the bridge and the stairs Walker and his engineer, Ritchie Rodger, would have been able to select ornamental ironwork from Walter Macfarlane's catalogue, which conveniently showed a street scene with a stone staircase. The chosen lamp standards and railings were manufactured a few miles away at Macfarlane's Saracen Foundry in Possilpark, from where the products featured in their catalogue were exported all over the world.
Street scene from Macfarlane's Catalogue showing proposed use of ornamental ironwork at staircase.
Most of the original cast iron fittings were removed during World War II to provide materials for the war effort. The lamp standard at the top of the stairs is the only surviving piece, albeit with a replacement light fitting.
Mr Walker strategically placed his cab office at the entrance to the bridge facing the steps. Residents wishing to leave the top level, on the City of Glasgow Bank's development, were enticed to use the stairway down to the bridge where they could hire one of Walker's hansom cabs.
The alternative way to cross the river was by following the roadway at the top of the wall slowly down to the Belmont Bridge, which was further away from the heart of Glasgow's West End.

The map below dates from 1894. Contemporary Post Office Directories have been used to add details of the stages of development of the City of Glasgow Bank's land from the Belmont Bridge to the Queen Margaret Bridge.
The first stage of development was Doune Terrace, which is now part of Belmont Street. Doune Terrace first appears in the Post Office Directory for 1872/73, just 2 years after the new bridges were constructed.
1894 map showing the various stages of development from 1872 to 1889.
This earlier map was surveyed before the City of Glasgow Bank's development of the area to the south of Kelvinside Gardens. It shows Walker's ""bridge to nowhere"" ending abruptly at open space in the strip of land he owned along the riverside.
North Woodside House stood on the north bank of the River Kelvin near the site of the bridge at Belmont Street and Kelvin Stevenson Memorial Church, above.
The mansion was demolished in 1869 after the estate had been acquired by the City of Glasgow Bank for the development of a new suburb.
John. J. Stevenson's drawing of the tower of Kelvin Stevenson Memorial Church, above, was displayed at the annual exhibition of the Royal Glasgow Institute of the Fine Arts in 1900.
This reminiscence of the pre-development riverbank between the Belmont Bridge and the Queen Margaret Bridge gives a romanticised description of the scenery ""where the great retaining wall now rises across Queen Margaret Bridge"". It presents a beautiful portrait of a stretch of the riverside previously composed of wooded banks awash with wild flowers, sadly superseded by the vertical face of the dead wall.
North Kelvinside Parish Church, at the corner of Queen Margaret Drive and Kelbourne Street, opened as Kelvinside U.P. Church in 1896. It was built with rock faced red sandstone in the Late Decorated Gothic style to the designs of the architect, John Bennie Wilson.
The memorial stone for the church was laid by Lady Bell at a ceremony on 5th October 1895. The church was demolished in 1987 due to subsidence caused by undermining.
Kelvinside U.P. Church was established on 3rd September 1893 in the original church hall with an opening ceremony conducted by Rev. Dr. Black of Wellington U.P. Church. The hall was designed in the early English Gothic style by Alexander Petrie and operated as a 'preaching station' under the charge of Rev. John Young, Home Mission Secretary, until July 1894 when Rev. Alex Whyte was inducted as the congregation's first minister.
The United Presbyterian denomination joined with the Free Church in 1900 to form the United Free Church, which merged with the Church of Scotland in 1929 when the building became known as North Kelvinside Parish Church.
The ground is still so unstable that no alternative use has been found for the site of the church which has returned to the wild.
At the western edges of the new suburb, on the land attached to Kelvinside House which was in the sole ownership of John E. Walker, there was no need for any civil engineering works before development could proceed.
In 1872, the area to the west of the newly constructed Queen Margaret Bridge, surrounding Kelvinside House, was made available for development.
Sites were offered for the feuing of villas, terraces and tenements through Walker's agents, Messrs Haig & Low, Architects, of 94 West Regent Street, Glasgow.
Botanic Crescent was originally titled Derby Crescent. The map below shows the situation in 1894, after the initial development in the 1870's and the later demolition of Kelvinside House. The red sandstone tenements shown in the above photograph were built on the cleared site around the turn of the century.
The Kirklee Bridge at the western extremity of Clouston Street was opened in 1900, connecting North Kelvinside with the later suburb of Kelvinside, which was still in the process of development after the land had been annexed by the city in 1891. The acquisition of this territory allowed Glasgow Corporation to extend the Botanic Gardens into what had previously been the landward side of the river.
The cast iron decoration on the Kirklee Bridge fared better than that on the original Queen Margaret Bridge and surrounding civil engineering works. Thankfully the magnificent lamps shown below were not removed at the time when the ironwork at the Sixty Steps was being scrapped.
The part of the old estate known today as “North Kelvin Meadow” was never developed at any time as the suburb grew. The aerial picture (above) and map from 1894 (below) show an almost identical layout to the area.
The corner occupied by the schools at the top of the photograph is shown as Kelburn Park (Athletic Ground) in the old map. The remainder of the site, which still lies vacant, has been used for various recreational purposes over the years, before plans for its development were made in recent times.
The ""North Kelvin Meadow"" has been nurtured by locals as a wild natural space. It was under threat of development in the summer of 2011 when these pictures were taken.
The residents’ struggle to preserve this ecologically important ground is being co-ordinated by the North Kelvin Meadow Campaign .
The North West Fire Station at the corner of Kelbourne Street and Sanda Street was constructed in 1936 to the designs of the City Engineer, Thomas Somers.
The station and the associated firemen’s housing were converted into apartment blocks in the early 1990’s. The centre of the development has an open landscaped courtyard, where the fire engines were previously garaged. This provides residents' car parking as well as a pleasant urban space.
Moving back to the section of North Kelvinside to the east of Queen Margaret Drive, the Lanarkshire Regiment Drill Hall can be found in Jardine Street. The hall was built in 1894 in an unusual mock Tudor style. It was designed by Robert A. Bryden, who is best known as the architect of the Quarrier's Homes at Bridge of Weir.
The hall is currently occupied by the Lowland Reserve Forces & Cadets Association.
The enlarged St Charles' Primary School was designed in-house by Glasgow Corporation in 1932, when Art Deco was the popular style. The school’s frontage was created with a combination of smooth and rock-faced red sandstone, which is a very unusual medium for the use of Art Deco design.
The design of the school is credited to William McCaig, the Education Department's architect, who used some modernistic touches in the public areas of the interior.
Gillespie Kidd and Coia’s St Charles Church was built in 1959-1960. It is credited to Jack Coia, assisted by Andrew MacMillan, Isi Metzstein and Joe Taylor.
The church was built around a concrete frame and has a vaulted concrete roof. The Stations of the Cross were sculpted by Benno Schotz, shortly before his death in 1961.
More images of the stunning interior of St Charles' Church,North Kelvinside can be viewed in the Jack Coia section of this website.
Outside the church there is a 75-foot high freestanding concrete bell tower, which is an unusual local landmark.",en,reference

"THESE were the horrific scenes outside a mosque when hundreds of people gathered to watch a screaming woman being beaten with a cane for standing too close to a man she wasn't married to.
Nur Elita was charged by officials with showing affection to a university male student to who she wasn't married to.
The man in question, who has not been identified, was also punished by authorities in the barbaric scenes in Indonesia.
Ms Elita received five lashes and had to be rushed to hospital.
The gruesome punishment took place in the country's northern province of Banda Aceh, under the commandments of Sharia Law, a legal system based on Islam which regulates all aspects of everyday life.
Among those witnessing the macabre spectacle was the town's Deputy mayor Zainal Arifin.
Under local rules, men and women who are not spouses are not allowed to interact with each other.
Over the years Banda Aceh, a predominantly Muslim region, has become increasingly conservative.
In October, strict anti-homosexuality rules came into effect, sparking an outcry from human rights campaigners. Adultery also carries a potential punishment of 100 strokes.
Local Sharia enforcer Syahrizal Abbas claimed earlier this year the new laws were being brought in to ""safeguard human dignity.""
He said: ""It is to protect Aceh's Muslims from committing immoral acts.""
Amid the region's growing conservatism, relations between Muslims and Christians have deteriorated, with a number of churches being destroyed in the past few months.
Although ethnically diverse, Indonesia is the world's most populous Muslim country.
Spread across a chain of thousands of islands in Asia, the government in the capital Jakarta has for years been facing calls for independence in several provinces.

"Detox Dieter’s review of Leaky Gut Syndrome details important natural diet steps to take in order to prevent the discomfort associated with this common digestive disorder.
Leaky Gut Syndrome is a debilitating and dangerous condition. This report provides you with the information to address the health conditions associated with Leaky Gut Syndrome.
Leaky gut syndrome is the technical name for increased intestinal permeability. As its name signifies, this condition is characterized by a gut (intestinal tract) that allows far too many undigested substances into the bloodstream. The body often responds by “attacking” these substances, resulting in digestive discomfort, autoimmune conditions, and food allergies.
In many cases, leaky gut syndrome will actually contribute to the body attacking itself, increasing the risk of autoimmune disease such as alopecia, celiac disease, Graves’ disease, endometriosis, and many more.
A substantial proportion of the population suffers from immune diseases, which are often chronic, debilitating, and life-threatening. There are more than eighty illnesses caused by autoimmunity and about 75 percent of those affected are women. It has been estimated that autoimmune diseases are among the ten leading causes of death among women in all age groups up to 65 years.
The article and video posted on Detoxdieter.org details what causes leaky gut syndrome, why it is dangerous, and how to treat it using vitamin C, essential fatty acids, and other nutrients found in natural foods.
According to Michael Healey of DetoxDieter.org, “Leaky Gut Syndrome is a debilitating and dangerous condition. This report provides you with the information to address the health conditions associated with Leaky Gut Syndrome.""

"A diverse nation of 63 million, with a land mass of over 800,000 square kilometers, Turkey shares land borders with eight countries (Greece, Bulgaria, Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Iran, Iraq and Syria).
Turkey is a key US ally in a region marked by turmoil. A member of NATO since 1952, Turkey has stood by the side of the US as far back as the Korean War. During the Persian Gulf War, Turkey broke off relations with Iraq, including closing the oil pipeline before the UN-approved oil-for-food deal reopened it, and allowed US flights from bases in Turkey. Turkey has participated in NATO's action in Kosovo, providing pilots and Turkish F-16 planes, bases for American use, and 1,000 peacekeepers for the peacekeeping mission. Before the bombing in Kosovo ended, Turkey had accepted 17,600 refugees in camps in western Turkey, as well as supported camps in Albania and Macedonia.
Turkey's delegation in the United States is headed by Ambassador Baki Ilkin. Married with two sons, Ilkin began his career in Turkey's Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Department of Greek Affairs. He also served in the Cyprus/Greek Department of the Foreign Ministry followed by postings in Athens and Moscow. Ilkin has been chief of the Private Cabinet of the foreign minister, a counselor in the Turkish Embassy in London, personal advisor to the foreign minister on two separate occasions, and chief of the Turkish president's Private Cabinet. Ilkin also has been ambassador for Turkey in Pakistan, Denmark, and the Netherlands.
In 1963 the Association Agreement foresaw Turkey's full membership in the then European Economic Community, incorporating a customs union for trade relations to measure Turkey's progress toward full membership. Due to political instability and the 1980 coup, membership work was stalled. In 1987 Turkey got back on track with its membership application, and in 1995 the Customs Union between Turkey and the European Union (EU) was established.
The EU has stipulated Turkey must make advances in its economy and human rights record in order to accede into the Union. In 1997, the EU's 'Agenda 2000' report on enlargement went further and separated Turkey from other candidates in terms of conditions she must meet before joining the EU. The European Council excluded Turkey from the next round of accession negotiations while including Cyprus and five Central and Eastern European nations. In addition, the Greek-promoted condition that Turkey agree to United Nations negotiations on Cyprus was added to future accession consideration. As a result, Turkey and the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) dug in their heels and began insisting the TRNC be accepted as an equal partner with state status in future negotiations, something the US and some members of the EU are against.
WI: How important is it for Turkey to become a member of the European Union (EU) and what is the main obstacle to membership?
Amb. Ilkin: It is important for us to become a member of the EU. We have been seeking full membership since 1963. At the moment Turkey is not ready to be a full member, but we should be considered a full candidate. Although we have established a customs union with the EU, and there are close ties with each member of the EU, and we have an association agreement with the EU, we have not been declared a full candidate. We deserve full candidacy. Becoming a full candidate does not mean you automatically become a full member. There are things which need to be done, and Turkey is prepared to meet those criteria. No other candidate has been asked to fulfill certain requirements before they are declared candidates. In the case of the Central and Eastern European countries, the criteria is not there [for full membership] but they were declared candidates. Definitely, if Europe is reunited, Turkey has also contributed to the process. We have expected more understanding and support from some of our European friends for our full candidacy. There was one more attempt [in June in Cologne] at the European Union Summit to prepare us as a full candidate, but some of the member countries objected. A new attempt will be pushed forward in Finland [at the next EU Summit].
In 1930, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk and Eleutherios Venizelos (then leader of Greece) signed the Convention on the Establishment of Commerce and Navigation, a cooperative framework between Turkey and Greece. Peace existed between these two countries until the 1950s when the issue of independence for Cyprus from the British caused ethnic tensions; Greek Cypriots comprised four-fifths of the island's population and Turkish Cypriots worried about ethnic imbalance in the new government. Following strained relations between the two communities, in 1960 the British pulled out of Cyprus and the Republic of Cyprus was born, with Greece and Turkey as co-guarantors of the new, independent nation.
Plagued with problems from the beginning, the complex, bi-communal government on Cyprus broke down completely in 1963. As a result of heavy fighting, the Turkish Cypriots retreated into enclaves for protection. The United Nations dispatched a peacekeeping force (UNFICYP) and embarked on a decade-long peacemaking effort. The UN effort failed and in 1974 a rightist Greek group, with the support of the military junta in Athens, usurped the Cypriot government and supported annexing the island to Greece. Turkey reacted by sending its military into northern Cyprus. Ultimately the Turkish military took over a third of the island, which it still holds today. Turkish Cypriots fled north while Greek Cypriots fled south. The 'Green Line' was drawn between the two communities and the Greek Cypriot-led government was reinstated as the world-recognized legitimate power. The Turkish Cypriots declared themselves a state and established the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. Against pressure from the world community, Turkey alone has maintained that the Greek Cypriot government is not legitimate and demands negotiations on the status of Cyprus. While the Greek Cypriots look to a bi-zonal, bi-communal federation with a single governmental body, the Turkish Cypriots emphasize the importance of a confederation with the governments of each side seen as equals.
WI: What is the main obstacle to resolving the conflict in Cyprus and what sort of route should Cyprus take toward solving the current problems?
Amb. Ilkin: The basic issue is that the Greek Cypriot side will not accept the realities on the ground. There are two states, two peoples, two sovereign administrations. They have been living separately since 1963. If a solution is to be found, it is to be found in an administration in which the two parties share certain powers, and then they can move on and set up a joint administration. But, if they reject the realities on the ground, I'm afraid there is not a possibility of finding a solution. If the Greek Cypriot administration realizes they do not rule the Turkish Cypriots and that their authority is confined to their side, if they are willing to sit down and discuss on equal footing, on an equal basis with their Turkish Cypriot counterparts, then there could be a solution, a confederation. Who knows what the next 20 or 30 years have in store for both peoples? It will start as a confederation on an equal basis and, hopefully, they can build enough confidence that they can be more integrated as they go along. The Turkish Cypriots want a confederation in which equal sovereignty of the two states is accepted. The Turkish Cypriots recently went to elections, and the party that advocates a confederation won a strong majority in parliament. Cyprus could be a perfect confederation model if the Greek Cypriots agree to the solution.
In April 1999 Turkish citizens elected a new government. The coalition formed from the Democratic Left Party, the Nationalist Action Party and the Motherland Party received a vote of confidence from Parliament and is the 57th government of Turkey. The policy and governing package the coalition presented to parliament covers many needed reforms. For instance, in the area of human rights, the new government proposes to lift barriers to the freedom of expression, improve training of the security forces, and strengthen the independence and functions of the judiciary.
WI: What is Turkey's response to world criticism of its human rights record?
Amb. Ilkin: We are all concerned about our own human rights records. Every country is concerned about this. Few countries can say they are finished [working on human rights]. If you single out Turkey, you will be doing it an injustice. In Turkey's case, we need to do more about it. When you talk about human rights you have to differentiate between the abuse of human rights by individuals and the abuse of human rights by states. You can only put Turkey in the first [category]. For that, the present government has a package; hopefully they will enact it. We would do this not just to appease someone abroad, we would do it for the sake of the nation.
WI: Turkey and the US have a history of partnership. What is the basis of this relationship, and how will you work to strengthen the bridge while you are here?
Ambassador Ilkin: It's a solid relationship. It has gone through the test of time. The most important dimension has been the security issue. [Most recently,] Turkey sent forces to Kosovo. We agreed to receive 46,000 Kosovar refugees and maintained 10,000 refugees in camps in Albania and Macedonia. There is still rebuilding and peacekeeping. [In addition to military cooperation with the US] we are now diversifying our relationship in such areas as culture, energy, and trade. In the last ten years trade has doubled, although this is still an insignificant figure compared to other countries, and we have to do more. We now define our relationship as an enhanced partnership, a mutual respect between the two nations. I believe this relationship serves both nations. A lot has been accomplished but, more can be done.",en,reference

"The First Presbyterian Church of Pendleton, Oregon, received 26 acres of land in the Blue Mountains from the Harrah family in the summer of 1940. Over the years, the property was developed into a rustic summer camp for children and youth, and a picnic site for adults and families.
In 1961, Martha Terney gave her 1600-acre wheat ranch, located west of Pendleton, for the future development and maintenance of Westminster Woods in memory of her daughter Lillian. Forrest Harrah donated $100,000 to Westminster Woods through his estate in 1985, with half endowed for future maintenance.
The Church purchased 7.8 acres to the northwest in spring of 1994. Later in 1994, Betty Brunette gave 31 acres on the west side, resulting in the current camp and conference center property covering 66 acres.

"• Iron over BEA zeolites increases the glycerol conversion.
• Total conversion of pure glycerol is achieved over 4% Fe BEA zeolite with Si/Al = 50.
• Fe(+ II) species are proposed as main active sites for glycerol conversion.

The preparation by post-synthesis isomorphous substitution of FeX-BEA-Y in one step was investigated for the oxidehydration of pure glycerol. TPR and DR UV–vis highlighted the presence of Fe(+ III) species in the framework of zeolites. Iron allows the activation of the catalyst by the reduction by glycerol of part of Fe(+ III) into Fe(+ II) species, which stabilizes the glycerol conversion. Total glycerol conversion is obtained with 4 wt% of iron and acrylic acid yield reaches 23% over this catalyst. The Fe(+ III) tetrahedral species are thought to be the main active redox sites for the formation of acrylic acid.",en,academic
"Everybody needs at least one party trick recipe — something you can make for a date or a dinner party that&apos;s sophisticated and a little bit fancy and that will turn out perfectly every single time — a showstopper that needs little accompaniment other than a few little buttery roasted potatoes and an herby salad. Let me introduce you to the salt-crusted fish.
Since fish generally cooks very quickly, it&apos;s easy to mess it up by overcooking. Creating a crust out of salt creates a layer of insulation, trapping moisture inside the fish and slowing down the cooking time. All you need is a whole fish with the skin on, covered in heaps of kosher salt mixed with a few egg whites. You bake this for about half an hour (the perfect amount of time to throw together a salad), and when you crack into the crust and excavate the fish, the skin pulls away from unbelievably juicy, perfectly salted flesh. With a drizzle of some good olive oil or a squeeze of lemon, you instantly have a restaurant-worthy dish.
Once you make this the first time, you&apos;ll realize that you barely need a recipe. The proportions of salt to egg whites don’t have to be exact, as long as you end up with a sort of wet sand consistency that’s easy to pack around the fish. You can also get some bonus party host points for improvising your own recipe by experimenting with different types of fish (snapper, sea bream, porgy, and bass are all good bets) or with different aromatics in the cavity (oranges, rosemary, thyme, garlic).
Preheat oven to 450°. Pour salt and egg whites into a large roasting pan and mix thoroughly.
Lay the fish out on top of the salt mixture, and stuff each cavity with a few slices of shallots and a few slices of lemon. Squeeze the cavities shut and pack the salt mixture around the fish until it is completely encased.
Roast for 25–30 minutes. Remove from oven and crack into salt crust using a heavy spoon or a meat tenderizer, or really anything you have around that will get the job done. Serve with a drizzle of good olive oil and some fresh lemon slices.",en,books

"I entered Gaza the 12th of January 2009 late in the evening with a group of doctors. It was my first time entering an active war zone and I was feeling kind of nervous.
The feeling of anxiety worsened as a sound of bomb dropping near the bus made us all in the “Gaza city” bus that is transferring people from Egyptian to Palestinian border fall under our seats.
The distance from the border of Rafa to the center of town is very small. By the time we arrived in the hospital, ambulances with the wounded people from the bomb that had dropped in the main market started arriving. The Greek and French doctors went directly to work. The feeling of human loss is unbearable. When the rush is over, your mind starts thinking of what the eyes have seen. Images of children, women, old people, young boys in blood, missing parts of their body, with crazy eyes come back but are rejected by the filter of logic. I think the human mind has the capacity of forgetting horror images such as these as it can’t bear them.
And then comes fear as sound of dropping bombs wake you up at night. After a while you get used to it, people were saying.
You actually do but only superficially.
You just learn to get back to sleep even thought anything can happen anywhere and there is no safe place to hide.
The next day Cuewa, an Irish girl from the Free Gaza movement arranged us to go to Gaza city with a convoy of 18 ambulances. “It is safer than any other vehicle” she said, “but still Israelis have already shot on ambulances and medics”.
We left at 9 o’clock at night, the ambulance loaded with one dead body of a young man to be carried to the Gaza morgue and the desolated brother of the dead man that didn’t speak though the whole trip.
Actually I didn’t speak either as I was wondering if this decision is my last one.
The details of arriving in a ghost city, passing some dead zones with tanks looking and targeting us was just the beginning of a week of fear.
The next day I spend it trying to understand how someone can move under these circumstances, where is what in this bombed city, how are things done. Even the easiest thing: buying bread was getting complicated: no exchange, no shops, no bread.
The next days I moved around with local press people from Ramattan television center and ambulances.
The heroes of this war were really these people: local journalists, medics and activists. The only humans moving around the city, specially after nightfall.
The nurses in the ambulances and the doctors were working 20 hours a day, sleeping in shifts in the hospitals.
The cameramen and reporters hadn’t seen their families for weeks.
The activists went with the ambulances wherever there was danger to be used as a human shield so the medics could pick up wounded or dead people from isolated areas.
I focused more on these people’s work as I preferred to see the hope and human force against horror than only death and despair.
I discovered things about me as well. I found out that in this question that is always asked to photographers and cameramen: do you take the picture or do you help the person that is suffering in front of you?
I thought I was in the first category but I am in the second one.",en,books
"Just when you thought it was safe to go out in DC again. We're going to run out of places to boycott if these DC club owners don't get their acts together.

During the week Park is a straight spot but on Sunday Night's club promoter Daryl Wilson takes over and the kids flock out in droves.
According to his post, Ross and Alesha exited the club and when they attempted to re-enter club security gave them a hard time. The situation escalated to the point DC police were asked to intercept. Read Rashad's post below as well as his video below.
The Manager (white shirt) came out and said she cannot come in based on a incident of discrimination a few weeks back where the Security Guards was mocking and Making remarks about her and She made a complaint. He continued to defend his decision even after she agreed to apologizes. The Security Guard then Says"" EXCUSE ME SIR"" Trying to be Disrespectful to her. We then askes to speak to the owner who came 30mins later. This Man (Dark Grey) shows up with a Very disrespectful Attitude and tell Alesha that Reason why she cant get in is because of a Facebook post that she made stating her dissatisfaction with the Clubs Security Disrespecting her.

"The headline in the April 7 Providence Journal was “RI economy cools off in first quarter.” It then quoted all the usual suspects as to why and how much. Inside the headline was “Economy steady but not spectacular,” referring to the national economy. What the first article neglected to say was that despite all the phony stuff told us about how to make the economy grow faster in Rhode Island, the Rhode Island economy has a growth rate year in and year out of about 70% of the US growth rate. 71.4% over the last 5 years, and nearly every year, despite the gyrations of policy, very close to 70%. RI grows at 70% of the US growth rate because the national growth rate is skewed up by a system of measurement that calls resource depletion and pollution growth, without deductions for the harm the businesses are causing to communities. It is time for truth in journalism about what is really going on in the economy rather than continuing to quote those who ignore the larger context.",en,web
"Anyone who has ever watched a football game on WatchESPN will tell you that the least appealing part of the broadcast is watching the same three or four advertisements over and over and over (and over). DAZN (pronounced “da zone”), the up-and-coming sports-streaming service led by former ESPN President John Skipper, is hoping to prove that doesn’t need to be your experience when watching live sporting events online.
Skipper, executive chairman of the DAZN Group, recently did a bunch of interviews in which he really tried to play up the appeal of the future-looking sports platform, especially compared to the way that traditional broadcasters such as ESPN have been doing business. One of the core components of his and DAZN’s pitch is that it’s ad-free, at least for now.
In a recent article by the Wall Street Journal, Skipper and his company explained in a little further detail how they plan to make the sports-viewing experience a bit less repetitive and a bit more enjoyable.
“What we will not do is irritate people,” Mr. Skipper added.
The company plans to introduce its own ad model in the next six to eight months, which will provide a more integrated viewing experience for advertisers, which includes sponsored content and product placement.
Not that the broadcast networks aren’t already aware of the erosion that can happen with their ratings and audiences over the frequency of ads. A recent Variety report noted that the NFL is trying to convince it’s broadcasting partners to get rid of billboard ads (graphics that pop up before or after breaks in the action promoting sponsors). The results have been mixed so far. Fox has basically done away with billboard ads from “Thursday Night Football.” However, the ads are still prevalent in Sunday afternoon NFL games. ESPN also appears to be testing out several replacement options, but CBS has so far refused to budge on their ad model.
The way that DAZN’s business works, they aren’t trying to compete head-on with CBS, Fox, or ESPN. Rather, they seem themselves more akin to Facebook or Google, who have streamed events and attempted to focus advertising towards specific viewers based on their habits. However, as our own Andrew Bucholtz noted, it’s not entirely clear how DAZN will be able to do that as well as those tech giants.
It’s also unclear just how much insight DAZN will be able to gain into its customers and if that will really help them serve better ads. Yes, they can presumably pull things like location from members’ billing addresses, but location alone doesn’t mean much. And especially at a point like this where DAZN’s main U.S. offering is boxing, they’re not going to find much revelatory from viewing habits; they may be able to target one kind of ad to boxing fans and one kind of ad to soccer fans, but there are huge differences from one boxing fan to the next.
Also, Skipper cites Facebook and Google as examples to follow here, but anyone who spends any amount of time online knows how wrong Facebook and Google still often are with their targeted ads, and they have far more information on their users than DAZN will (presumably) be able to get.
DAZN will get its first big sports league showcase to premiere that new ad model when they start streaming Major League Baseball content as part of a new three-year deal. The deal, which has apparently helped along by a consulting Jamie Horowitz, doesn’t include live games but will include live cut-ins coinciding with a studio show.
Per the WSJ, market-research firm Ampere Analysis estimates that the streaming service will need to acquire 1.5 million U.S. subscribers to break even on the deal. It’s unclear how many subscribers they have at the moment.",en,web

"Mike Staver is an expert on leadership. You, like most people, hear a lot about leadership. You get to see examples of it (or the lack of it) every day from the news to politics to your community, family and work.
Unlike many coaches and speakers Mike takes noisy, often complex, leadership content and makes it immediately useful, digestible and entertaining. That combination has influenced over 200,000 people in ways that not only transforms thinking and action but improves results. His counterintuitive perspective and his story telling style combined with an entertaining delivery makes the often challenging realities of work and life easier to absorb, hear and adjust to.
Mike encourages people to carefully and fully examine how their leadership is deeply personal and completely attainable if they are focused and aware of who they are, what they believe and how they influence (or should influence) others. His message is grounded in the belief that leadership is about influence regardless of position, title or power. Understanding and applying that increases performance quickly and thoroughly.
There’s more, but frankly….while all of that took a lot of work the real work was done in the years of day to day experience leading people and finding out what works and what doesn’t (honestly, probably more was learned from what didn't work). Those lessons were learned as a leader in organizations ranging from health care to high-end security and surveillance to representing employers in a variety of employee dispute issues.

"Fifty years ago, the Caldwell egg business was a very basic “mom and pop” type entity, processing and packing eggs in a building behind Caldwell Feed Mill in Rose Bud, Ark.
The Caldwells contracted out their egg production to growers across the area. At the time, there were three generations of Caldwell involved in the egg business, Bill Caldwell, his son Henry and grandson Billy Caldwell, who represent the second, third and fourth generations of the Caldwell family. The fifth generation, Billy’s son Seth, is waiting in the wings.
The contract egg business served the Caldwells well until the industry began to change dramatically in the mid-1990s. Much like the broiler industry, the entire poultry industry began to look at large economies of scale models and smaller producers found themselves either expanding to multi-house complexes to meet demands, or leaving the poultry business.
Faced with the same economies of scale scenario, Caldwell Foods LLC made the decision for a major facility expansion and to produce their own eggs.
In 1998, Caldwell Foods began construction on a large egg facility, complete with processing plant just north of Rose Bud. The plant became operational in 2000 and Caldwell Foods LLC., was formed to operate that aspect of the business with Billy and his wife Robin as the principals in the business.
Unlike the broiler industry, which maintains a steady profit model, the egg industry can provide some wild roller coaster margins for egg produces.
Major factors that influence profitability for the industry are: surpluses and deficits in the supply of eggs nationally (bird inventories) and the prevailing cost of major inputs, mainly grain feed. Additional factors that affect individual companies include the ability to correctly manage flock placements to match both local and national supply (price) variances and their ability to participate in supplying premium markets (customers).
Being a perishable commodity, eggs require refrigeration and expedited transportation throughout the food channels. The primary end users of shell eggs are retail customers who purchase them at grocery stores for household consumption, food service customers who purchase them to serve in restaurants and other commercial dining situations, and egg products companies who convert shell eggs into a multitude of egg products, many of which have extended shelf lives. And as most grocery shoppers know, there is not a one-size-fits-all to egg companies today any more than it was 50 years ago.
The egg industry presents challenges and opportunities just like any other industry.
Cage-free or free-range chickens is a trend that has certainly gained a lot of momentum the last few years and is one that has not gone unnoticed at Caldwell Foods.
The shift in production is away from traditional housing for laying hens to the new cage-free designs. What a lot of consumers do not realize is this will take a staggering amount of investment by the industry coupled with and a decision by the buying public to choose to purchase a more expensive product. Currently, consumers are proving to be slow in adopting higher the higher prices.",en,books
"If you are just doing simple animation sequences in Java,the performance you get from most Java environments is probably fine. If you are trying to write a video game or some other graphics-intensive program, you may find that you have to squeeze out every bit of performance from Java. Sometimes you are able to make some basic assumptions about the graphics environment you are running on, but that is not the case with Java. You don't know if your program will be running on a laptop with a simple VGA card, or on a Silicon Graphics system with extremely fast graphics.
On the PC platform alone, you have a wide variety of graphics capabilities. A simple system may have an old VGA card with an ISA bus interface, or an accelerated graphics card running on a PCI bus Pentium system. The approach used by many graphics vendors is to detect the system type either at installation time or at runtime. Once a program knows how well the graphics perform,it can adjust itself to accommodate a slower system. You can do this in Java, as well.In fact, it is even more important in Java since Java runs on so many different platforms.
Aside from adjusting to the capabilities of the local system, you can also reduce the amount of drawing your program has to do. If you redraw only the parts of a screen that need to be redrawn, you have more time to perform other tasks, or to create more animation frames.
Double-buffering, which was introduced in Chapter 5 ""Animating Images,"" is typically used to prevent flicker when you are doing animation. Under some graphics systems, however, it can also increase the graphics drawing speed.
This happens when the native drawing routines in the operating system have a lot of overhead when drawing to a visible area. The operating system often does far less work when you are writing to an off-screen area.
Just to refresh your memory, when you do double-buffering, you create an image that is the same size as the screen. You then use the getGraphics method to get a graphics context for the image, which you pass to your paint method. When the paint method does its drawing, it is really drawing on the image you created and not the actual screen. Once the paint method is finished, the update method copies the off-screen image to the screen.
Unfortunately, some Java systems draw faster when they are drawing off-screen, whereas others draw faster when they are drawing to the visible area. If you don't mind taking a short delay when your applet starts up, you can do a quick benchmark to choose between double-buffering and straight drawing.
There are many reasons for the speed differences between double-buffering and straight drawing. Sometimes the way the graphics system is implemented makes a difference. Some graphics systems can draw bitmaps to the screen much faster than they can draw individual pixels. In these cases, it is often better to write to a buffer and then draw the whole buffer. Other times, the graphics system may copy things to a buffer anyway, and if you draw to your own off-screen buffer, you waste time copying from one buffer to another.
To autodetect the graphics speed, do a simple series of drawings on an off-screen image and record the number of milliseconds it takes to complete the drawing. Then, do the same series of drawings to the screen and compare the results.
If you want the test to be invisible, do all the drawings in the applet's background color. Instead of doing the drawings invisibly, you can make a neat design that is just a normal part of the applet's startup.
Listing 20.1 shows an autodetect method that tries doing double-buffering and direct drawing. It tries to draw a series of images as many times as it can for approximately 500 milliseconds. Normally, you would just use whichever method is able to draw more frames in 500 milliseconds. If they happen to come up with the same number of frames, this autodetect method compares the total time used by each test. It is possible that one of the tests was allowed more drawing time than the other. If that is the case, and the tests each drew the same number of frames, the test that took less time to run is the faster method.
// the one that is best.
// Draw in the applet's background color, makes the autodetection invisible.
// the buffering was less, buffering is faster.
// offscreen image and graphics context.
The doAutoDetect method does not do any drawing itself. Instead, it calls another method called paintDetectDesign. This allows you to change the pattern you draw to perform the test. One of the things you might do when performing your test is to simulate the kind of drawing you plan to do. If you plan to draw a lot of images, your drawing test should draw some images. Listing 20.2 shows a sample paintDetectDesign that performs some basic graphics operations.
// some lines, boxes and ovals a number of times and then returns.
The trick with running the autodetection method is that you must run it from your update method. You can also run it from your paint method, but only if your update method isn't already doing double-buffering. You can create an update method that can be reused again and again, and can adapt to either direct screen drawing or double-buffered drawing.
The update method first checks to see if it has already performed the autodetection, and if not, calls doAutoDetect. Next, if the autodetection decided that it is faster to do double- buffering, the update method clears the drawing area in the off-screen buffer and then calls the paint method, making paint draw to the off-screen buffer.
If it is faster to draw directly to the screen, the update method simply calls super.update, which will clear the screen and call the paint method. Listing 20.3 shows an update method that performs all of these functions and works in conjunction with the doAutoDetect method.
// default update method by clearing the offscreen drawing area.
// to setColor and fillRect.
// color back to foreground.
The doAutoDetect and update methods from the AutoDetect class require some other variables to be present. You will find the complete source to the AutoDetect class on the CD that comes with this book.
Normally, when you want to redraw the screen you call the repaint method. This in turn calls update, which calls paint, which redraws the entire screen. If you are redrawing a complex scene, you could spend a lot of time redrawing things that never changed.
If you can keep track of which part of the screen actually changed and just redraw that part, you will save a lot of time. Unfortunately, it isn't always so easy to redraw only a portion of the screen.
Graphics systems like to deal with rectangles when it comes to repainting. Some systems allow you to create a list of rectangles describing the changed regions.
Java does not permit this, however. You can either repaint the entire screen or repeatedly call the repaint method for each rectangular region of the screen that needs to be changed.
Your ability to override the update method gives you a third option. If you create an update method that does not clear the screen, you can call repaint for the entire drawing area. Then, in your paint routine, examine only the changed areas and redraw them.
Listing 20.4 shows an applet that calls repaint to redraw only portions of the drawing area. The applet draws several rectangles, but will redraw only a rectangle if it touches the part of the screen that is being repainted. You can find out the part of the screen that is being repainted by calling the getClipRect method in the Graphics object that is passed to the paint method. The getClipRect method returns a Rectangle object that describes the area being repainted. One of the handy features about the Rectangle class is that it contains a method to tell whether two rectangles intersect. The UpdateRects applet uses this capability to see which of its rectangles intersect with the drawing area. If a rectangle doesn't intersect with the current drawing area, it doesn't repaint that rectangle.
If you want to see if a Polygon object intersects with the drawing area, you can use the getBoundingRect method in the Polygon class to get the rectangle that encloses the polygon. You can then use the intersects method in the enclosing rectangle to see if it intersects with the drawing area. There are cases where this technique might cause you to redraw a polygon when it really didn't need to be redrawn, but the amount of work it would take to prevent these cases probably won't save you any time overall.
// repaint specifically for the areas that change.
// paint assumes that it is only painting a portion of the screen.
// class to see which rectangles intersect with the repainted area.
// If a rectangle doesn't intersect, it doesn't need to be redrawn.
Alternatively, you can create a rectangle that represents the changed area and enlarge the rectangle to encompass newly changed areas. The Rectangle class contains an add method that returns the smallest rectangle that encloses two other rectangles.
When you determine the rectangle that encloses a changed area, you add that rectangle to the current changed area, producing a new changed-area rectangle. You have to be careful with this approach. If you start adding all your rectangles together, you may end up with one big rectangle that is as large as the drawing area.
This method is useful when you are moving an object around in fairly small increments. If the rectangular area holding the object's old area intersects with the new area, you might be better off adding the rectangles together. The closer the areas are to each other, the better it is to add the rectangles. If they are far apart, the sum of the rectangles holds a lot more unaffected space.
This might cause you to spend a lot of time repainting areas that haven't changed. Adding rectangles is a trade-off. You have to balance the redrawing of areas that may not need redrawing against the reduced number of repaints you actually do.
Rather than updating changed rectangular regions, you can simply redraw the changed areas. You create an update method that does not clear the drawing area. Instead, you assume that everything should stay the same and just redraw the changed parts.
This is most useful when you don't need to move objects around to arbitrary locations. Instead, you have fixed positions that can change and you just need to keep track of which ones have changed. It becomes more difficult to do this when you have overlapping objects that move frequently. Every time you update a portion of the screen, you have to figure out which objects are even partially visible in the changed section of screen, and you must repaint each object.
A Tetris game is a perfect example of this kind of selective updating. The game board is a grid. No grid cells overlap and you don't move any objects across the cells. All you need to do when redrawing a Tetris board is paint the grid cells that have changed since the last time you repainted.
The big snag with this technique is that it doesn't work well for direct screen painting, only for off-screen drawing. The reason is that the drawing area can be erased by the windowing system at any time, and your paint method is responsible for restoring it. In other words, you may be keeping track of the sections of the screen that you change, but the screen can be changed by external programs, as well. For instance, someone could open up another application that obscures your drawing area, and then close down that application again. At that point, you would need to update the entire screen.
If you are updating only specific areas of the screen, you will lose the rest if the screen gets erased. This doesn't happen with off-screen drawing because you control the drawing surface completely. It doesn't get erased unless you erase it.
If you are drawing off-screen (double-buffering), you can take advantage of the fact that the drawing area is available at any time and can't be accidentally erased. You can do your drawing from anywhere in your program, not just in the paint method. Of course, the off-screen picture won't be shown on the screen until your paint method is called.
This can be a huge advantage, since you don't have to keep track of what needs to be drawn when the paint method finally gets called. If you decide something needs to be changed, you change it immediately.
Listing 20.5 shows a series of methods from a Tetris-like applet that drops blocks on the screen. There are several methods for drawing blocks that actually draw on the off-screen drawing area. After a drawing method has drawn its blocks, it calls repaint to redraw the screen.
// for the 2-block area.
// then calls repaint for the entire screen.
Notice that the drawBlock and drawBlockPair methods in BlockDrop.java call repaint with a specific region. Even though the paint method assumes it is redrawing the entire screen, it really updates just a tiny portion of the screen. This technique does make a difference, even when paint still tries to draw the whole area. The reason it makes a difference is that you aren't using the low-level graphics routines to update every pixel on the screen, which does take some time.
The whole reason for this exercise of drawing to an off-screen buffer is that you are no longer constrained to doing all your drawing in the paint method. As soon as you decide that something on the screen needs to change, you can change it. Of course, you have to repaint the screen before the change is visible.
The BlockDrop applet drops blocks from the top of the screen by using a timer. It is able to redraw blocks from within the tick method (called by the timer) because it is drawing to an off-screen buffer. If it were drawing directly to the screen, it would have to make a note of which items had changed and then repaint the area for those items. The paint method would have to look at what had changed and repaint only those areas of the screen. Listing 20.6 shows the tick method from the BlockDrop applet. Notice that once it decides to add a new block or change a block, it immediately calls the methods to redraw the blocks.
// to start at 1 and not 0).
// is allowed to move.
Figure 20.1 shows the BlockDrop applet in action. The complete source code to BlockDrop.java is on the CD that comes with this book.
Figure 20.1 : The BlockDrop applet calls drawing routines from outside the paint method.
Some of these issues may be less important as the Java graphics system is improved. One of the features to be added is sprite animation, which allows you to define objects that can move around the screen. The graphics system would then take care of updating the changed areas. You would no longer have to keep track of them by hand.",en,code
"Businesses adopting artificial intelligence, chatbots get smarter, and ethical AI goes global.
2018 was the year that artificial intelligence seemed to really take off, with AI startups popping up everywhere and businesses looking to adopt the technology into everyday practices. But studies from Gartner and PwC show that only four per cent of technology executives successfully implemented AI this year in their businesses. In 2019 I predict that AI will be everywhere and more enterprises will be able to successfully adopt the technology to help improve business practices. For example, Deloitte Global projects that 70 percent of companies using AI will gain access to it through cloud-based enterprise software and services.
My second prediction is that we will be interacting more with AI as an increasing number of chatbots and virtual assistants pop up on our screens. And it will be smarter. AI is already actively interacting with humans in the form of virtual assistants for customer service for example. And AI technology continues to pop up in more places, like cars for example thanks to the release of Amazon Echo Auto that brings Alexa to your car (though not in Canada just yet). As AI continues to interact with humans it will get smarter and the lines between knowing when you’re interacting with a human or AI will continue to blur. Though things won’t change overnight and AI still has a long ways to go in being fully human-like with its interactions, 2019 will see more chatbots that are smarter than ever.
My final prediction is that ethical AI will go from global discussion to global policies. Governments, especially in Canada, have become increasingly aware of AI as a disruptive technology and the need to make sure it is governed by globally recognized ethical policies. The federal government this year created guiding principles for the responsible use of AI and prime minister Trudeau along with French president Emmanuel Macron committed to creating a global study group in ethical AI. As AI interacts with more people and is involved in making more decisions that affect our lives, ethical AI is an important discussion that needs to be had to ensure that it is responsibly implemented without bias towards the people it is interacting with. 2019 will see more international governments stepping up their efforts to work with businesses and organizations to develop and implement these ethical AI policies.",en,reference

"I love having houseplants, but when you live in a small apartment, there are only so many window ledges, tables and bookshelves to put them on. When you’ve run out of surfaces for greenery, do you stop hoarding plants? Of course not. You start putting them on your walls! Wall-mounted plants might look fancy—they’re basically living art in my book—but they’re actually very easy to assemble and care for. And all sorts of plants will happily live mounted—the vining ones are my personal favorite!
-a mountable plant: staghorn ferns, philodendrons, hoyas and succulents are good choices. I used a hoya obovata (upper left in the image above), satin pothos (right) and a hoya carnosa (bottom).
-wood board: I used some reclaimed wood slabs, but a new cut of wood from a home improvement store would work just as well.
Nail the sawtooth hanger into the back of the board. Place the potted plant on the front of the board and decide where you want to place it.
Hammer 8-12 nails into the board in a circle, about a 1/2 inch wider than the widest part of the plant pot. Angle the nails slightly outward toward the edge of the board. Remove the plant from its pot, loosen the roots and remove most of the excess soil.
Place the plant firmly on the board and wrap pieces of sheet moss around the soil, pressing and shaping the moss and soil within the nails. Tip: a second pair of hands to hold the plant in place while you secure it is a big help. Cut a 3 foot piece of fishing line or twine and tie it to a nail, leaving a 3 inch tail—you’ll use this to tie off the string when you’re done securing the plant. Pull the line tightly across the plant, hook it around a nail, and cross over to another nail, pulling the line taut to secure the plant. Keep going until you’ve hooked each nail once or twice and the plant feels secure.
I used twine for this plant so you could see what the plant should look like when secured. Trim the excess twine and hang it up! Water your plant immediately after mounting it. Follow care instructions for your specific plant, and keep in mind that mounted plants dry out faster than potted plants. As a general rule, mounted plants do well in bright, indirect light with watering every 1-2 weeks.

How come I’ve never thought of using plants as living art? I can even use fake plants in this case, since anything alive usually dies under my care. Great idea!
Yeeees, I love this! I can’t live without plants in my living space. Even in uni, I grew a massive basil plant in my dorm window. This’ll help maximize my plant space for sure!
That is such an excellent idea!
I love this, but how does the water not drip down from watering the plant? Sounds messy. Am I missing something?
How do you actually water it? Won’t the water get everywhere?
Take it off the wall and place in a sink to water weekly. Also using a water bottle to lightly mist daily is great!
This is such a brilliant idea! I’m assuming to “water” them you just lightly mist them?
These are so fun! I totally want to incorporate this into our house!
This is such a unique idea! I love adding greenery anywhere possible…and vertically up a wall? The options are now endless!
This looks absolutely amazing, I would love to have some living art in my home!
Such a great little touch to make a house a home!
Thank you so much for this! I saw an arrangement like this in a restaurant and was dying to have so,etching like it in my room!
Love the idea and the look. How do you make sure that you are giving the right amount of water? Trying to make sure that water does not run down the wall, I imagine I would starve the plant.
This looks so cool but I worry about it being too messy!
I love this. It looks so natural, but polished at the same time!
This is such a fabulous idea, I just love it!
I have wanted to add more plants inside my condo, but I essentially live in a cave. I live on the ground floor of a condo, near the pool and mail boxes, so I can’t exactly leave my windows open. I have sheer curtains that let in some light. Do you have any recommendations for VERY low light plants? Cave-like low light.
How do u water them..
I have seen these on long planks of reclaimed wood using faux succulents. The end result looks fantastic. They used a small block of Styrofoam covered in sheet moss with a little Spanish moss.
Now this is a genius idea!",en,web
"I realized that I already drew a response for ‘Beckon,’but I must have had a reason for keeping it on the list. I do like this one better than the first. I didn’t include a lot of detail. I might go back and add more detail later, but perhaps not.

In addition to sewing I have been cutting.
All of the pinks in the Pink Donation Quilt have a square in the piece on the left. There are a few from some fabrics I bought in the last little while. I also have some patches from the Art Gallery scraps I received.
I have to admit that I arranged the scraps a bit so they look good in the photos I post for you. Look for these patches in the final piece.
I am back trying to post the abundance of Creative Prompt Project Responses I drew a week or so ago.
This is abundance. I always wanted a cornucopia, so I thought I would try and draw one. Drawing things with a lot of elements can be a bit tedious, but I am pleased with the result.
Roman bridge built by ancient Romans, were the first large and lasting bridges built. Roman bridges were built with stone and had the arch as its basic structure. (see arch bridge). Most utilized concrete as well, which the Romans were the first to use for bridges.
Bridge cameras are cameras which fill the niche between the single-lens reflex cameras (SLRs) and the Point-and-shoot camera.

Definition: A bridge is a structure built to span physical obstacles such as a body of water, valley, or road, for the purpose of providing passage over the obstacle. Designs of bridges vary depending on the function of the bridge, the nature of the terrain where the bridge is constructed, the material used to make it and the funds available to build it.

I went downstairs this morning to get some water before I started my day. I hadn’t see the mail from the day before and it was sitting on the dining room table. I glanced through it and noticed two handwritten enveloped addressed to me. I recognized the addresses as being from the recipients of the Stars for San Bruno quilts. My heart fluttered a bit.
I didn’t get a response to my emails and notes, so I didn’t want to say anything to you when I sent the quilts off last Friday (return receipt requested) in case they were not well received.
Crazy talk, I know. Sometimes I can’t help myself.
I was kind of afraid of what I would find when I read the notes, so I went and got ready for work and started my breakfast before I read them.
I really never know how people will respond.
Will they hate the look of the quilt?
Will they feel resentful because they feel obligated to me?
I rarely ever send anyone anything with the expectation of getting something back. The reviews I do for Lark Books I do as a service to YOU. When I send letters to my friends, I send them with a sense of joy in my heart that they will receive a handwritten letter they can enjoy.
There was no reason for me to be afraid. Their notes were grateful and heartfelt. They made me cry.
“Words can’t express the feelings that T and I felt. Tears of happiness to know that so many wonderful people put their hearts and hands into such a beautiful quilt….
I am so pleased. I am pleased that the quilts were accepted with the spirit in which they were sent. I was pleased to get such heartfelt thank you notes. Those notes made all the difference.
Note to those who participated: I will scan the notes and send them off to you separately.
Yes, here is the pink donation top. It will go off to Jennifer and Deborah the Charity Queens of Awesomeness at the next BAMQG meeting.
As you might remember (since I know you memorize all of my posts), there was some lively discussion about the white sashing I used last time on the Blue Donation Top and how the quilt would look with sashing the same color as the foreground patches. Now you know. This top is very pink. DH even commented that it wasn’t usual for me. I like it and definitely put it in the cheerful category.
I made the back, too, but it is nothing to write home about, so no photo for you.
This was made entirely using leaders and enders method while I was piecing other things such as the latest Swoon block, the Corner Store and some other random blocks that you will hear about soon. See what you can accomplish?
Now I am working on a yellow version from the Art Gallery Scraps, plus a few other yellow scraps I scrounged up.
For those of you counting, this makes two finished tops this week. Yes, TWO!!!
After not having much time to sew, as described previously, I spent a lot of time sewing over the weekend. In fact, aside from a quick trip to dinner and a movie with my favorite date and a few other minor chores (no gardening!), I spent the whole weekend sewing.
The Corner Store seems to have taken me a long time. Looking back, I don’t think it should have been on my 26 projects list. After all, when I wrote the 26 Projects List it was just a placemat and an idea; it wasn’t really a UFO. Still and all, I put it on the list and I have decided that everything on the list will get a disposition.
Over the weekend, I made significant progress on this quilt. The picture above shows what I had done previously – most of the blocks were sewn together in groups of four. I had started to sew those groups together, but didn’t get very far, so that is what I worked on.
One after the other, I sewed the groups of four into groups of 8 and then the groups of eight into groups of 16. Basically, I chunked them.
In between, I pushed bits of the Pink Donation Quilt through the machine and made significant progress on that as well as a bit of progress on the yellow version which is the next donation quilt on the list. Another post for another day. Stay tuned.
I finished the top and am well on my way to finishing the back. I am going to use a big piece of a Phillip Jacobs print called Japanese Chrysanthemum. This fabric was destined to be a very nice bag, but I think, even though I bought the pink colorway, that there is too much brown. I am just not a brown person.
I had planned to put a spiky border a la Gwen Marston. The Molly Flanders blog has a very nice tutorial, which shows a similar quilt to this one with the spiky border I decided not to make.
Ok, here is the confession. This is a pretty quilt top. It is well made, my corners match, etc, but this top has no soul. If I weren’t compulsive about getting project finished, then it would be an interminable UFO. I don’t know why it has not soul, but it doesn’t. I’ll finish the back, get it quilted and then figure out what to do with it. It is a little too girly for one of the boys, but we will see. So it goes, sometimes.
I thought I would make up an example of one way you could put the Block-a-Long blocks together in a sampler format. This layout looks a lot more complicated than it really is. Remember each block is relatively easy.
Of course, there are a multitude of ways you could put together a sampler quilt. I was thinking that these blocks would lend themselves to a scrap quilt. As you get scraps large enough to make one of the blocks, make one, then eventually you would have enough for a quilt. It would be a nice memory of projects you did in a year or over a period of time.
I haven’t had time to do more than glance through them, but for some reason, I wanted to let you know that I had a couple of new books.
Color Magic for Quilters is all Sandy’s fault. That is Sandy of Quilting…for the Rest of Us. I’ll have to think of something so she will spend her money.
She is doing a mini-project called Total Color Tuesdays post on her blog every Tuesday (stealing all of my glory for the upcoming design episode on color, I would like to point out). You can participate in her exercises. Color Magic for Quilters uses a different system than Munsell or Ives. I don’t know which;you’ll have to wait for my review. I’ll read the book and get back to you.
Fearless Creating is a book I won as a door prize at the last BAMQG meeting. I am not a big door prize fan. I don’t object to them, but I just usually don’t want what people are giving away. This time I really wanted this book and nearly grabbed it out of someone’s hand as we were called at the same time. I told her I would loan her the book. She was on the fence about it anyway, so I don’t feel guilt.
I received a bunch of scraps from Pat Bravo at Art Gallery Fabrics. She offers them periodically and ‘scraps’ is a total misnomer.
The most bright and cheerful fabric was a scrap, but everything else was half yards or slightly smaller. Compared to what I consider unusable, these ‘scraps’ were a trip to the fabric store.
All the fabrics I got were in the yellow family. Some of them were gold. Some more on the brown side. There were two fabrics with words on them, which I liked, but refrained from looking up on Quiltshops.com.
My intent was to make an entire quilt with the foreground from this package of fabrics. I am not sure that is possible. The quilt might be a bit too boring. I have a few yellow fabric squares that I have been cutting, so I’ll see about adding those in.
I washed the fabric, as is my habit and got to work.
I took the opportunity to cut a few pieces for myself, but really, I cut them into 8″ squares to cut on the Accuquilt, which I did.
I think it is so interesting that Pat and her crew color coordinate the scraps. This is a fabric combination that I would never put together myself, but it is one, which is somewhat appealing and I am looking forward to the challenge of trying to make it work. I need to finish the Pink Donation top before I can start this one and I need to cut some background fabrics.
Where are we now?I am the grass.
Definition: Grasses, or more technically graminoids, are monocotyledonous, usually herbaceous plants with narrow leaves growing from the base. They include the “true grasses”, of the Poaceae (or Gramineae) family, as well as the sedges (Cyperaceae) and the rushes (Juncaceae). The true grasses include cereals, bamboo and the grasses of lawns (turf) and grassland. Sedges include many wild marsh and grassland plants, and some cultivated ones such as water chestnut (Eleocharis dulcis) and papyrus sedge (Cyperus papyrus). Uses for graminoids include food (as grain, sprouted grain, shoots or rhizomes), drink (beer, whisky, vodka), pasture for livestock, thatch, paper, fuel, clothing, insulation, construction, sports turf, basket weaving and many others.

There should be a reality show called Vendors Behaving Badly. It couldn’t be any worse than the reality TV shows on channels today. When copious amounts of caffeine and chocolate didn’t work, I took myself off to the John Berggruen Gallery to look at the Wayne Thiebaud exhibit they have on display.
I love Wayne Thiebaud’s work.
I love the way his brushstrokes look. I love the way he paints regular things. The cakes and pies and other desserts are kind of special, but they are also normal. I strive to be a bit influenced by his work in my own drawings for the Creative Prompt Project.
One of the things I like about his painting of the out tray or letter tray (don’t know the real title) is the writing. The way he painted the writing really makes it look real, if a bit blurred. I am interested in his technique, because of my recent attempts at including writing in my Creative Prompt Responses, e.g. #141.
I tried to notice things about his work and not do just a “drive by” viewing. This was an interesting selection of his works. I had seen similar paintings, but I am not sure if I have seen these exacts images.
I prefer his cakes and desserts to his landscapes, so I made myself really look at the landscapes this time. I think of Mr. Thiebaud as using very thick paint. I didn’t see that as much in this exhibit in general, but also didn’t see it in the landscapes. I wonder if he uses a flatter painting technique with his landscapes? I was able to still see the brush strokes when I looked at the paintings at an angle. I couldn’t see 3 dimensionality, however, looking at the painting straight on. The strokes on the backgrounds were very vertical, which I think added to the sense of extreme hills.
The landscapes were almost a caricature of the City. He used subtle colors and different colors that one would expect for a landscape – blues in the trees, turquoise and yellow. The colors add interest and are effective.
There were a few paintings from the 1960s and some from 2004, 2007, etc. It was very interesting to see the evolution in his work, not only in technique, but also in the changes to his series.
One thing I noticed in the Hats and Shoes painting was the pink ceiling was a slightly lighter pink than the wall. Very effective.
I am pleased that I went. I would love to have the space as a studio!
This list is really funny. I want to scratch items off of it, but I don’t want to rush through them either. I find that, now, I pick up a project and intensely work on it until it is finished. Any projects on this list are projects I have decided I want to work on. At least I want to work on them at the moment. If I decide I don’t want to work on them anymore, I will abandon them.
Here is the list, again, still in no particular order, except that I have put some of the “mostly finished” projects at the end. This time, like last, I have moved the finished pieces off. Still 23 WIPs left, because I added the Wonky 9 patch. Darn you inspiration!
Original Bullseye: needs border, backing, quilting and binding, which are all hard to do if you can’t find the project. It is lost. I know it is in there somewhere. As I mentioned, I did a test and found that my original idea didn’t work. I think a plain border will set off the blocks fine IF I ever find the top. Bleah!
Corner Store: All blocks are made (an additional 11 were made on 6/17). I have now sewn all the blocks together in groups of 4. On 6/17, I also started sewing the groups of 4 to each other.
Infinity blocks: Am starting to think this would make a good nephew quilt.
A-B-C (A-Z) BAMQG Challenge – I am actually not sure if this should be considered a WIP (Please say no!), because I just barely have enough blocks with which to make something. I am making good progress. I have S and T blocks on my mind. I am really thinking about just making all the blocks, putting sashing around them and then trimming the sashing a bit so the blocks are all a uniform size. They are not wildly off, but they are a bit off… I could bring them to BAMQG as the blocks are due. We’ll see.
Aqua-Red Sampler – steady progress has stopped and the class more than the quilt is really weighing on my mind. As far as I know Frances has finished her Dresden Plate, so perhaps we will start up again soon. The next class was going to be fusible machine applique’, but I haven’t gotten past cutting out the templates. Perhaps I should skip to machine piecing curves?
The Tarts Come to Tea: I haven’t quilted on this since April 2011. I need to work on the quilting. I was making good progress and then got sidetracked. I have been quilting another quilt and that is getting me back in the swing of quilting. Now that my machine is happier, perhaps it is a good time to take this piece out again? I would like to finish it.
Garden: I started this piece in a class with Pamela Allen in 2006. As mentioned, I used this piece for my beading demo for the 2012 EBHQ Voices in Cloth show (March 17), which means that I added some beads. I started on the machine quilting late in April and am almost finished with the background. I was kind of stuck on the flower petals, but may FMQ them now that my machine is feeling better.
Flower Garden: I still find the ‘flowers’ too spiky. I think I need to soften them up a bit.
Moon and Stars: need to finish hand quilting. This quilt is not interesting. This is month 2 that I have thought this is a candidate for abandonment.
Pointillist Palette #4: Fourth is a series of 6 quilts; needs tiny square patches sewn together. Good leaders and enders project. I wonder if I cut the squares accurately?
Spiderweb: need to make sure that I have the right number of blocks for the size quilt I want to make. Need to make sure I have the border pattern and start sewing border blocks.
New: Super Secret Project: top, back and binding made. Ready to go to the quilter. Stayed tuned.
FOTY 2011: at the quilter, needs binding.
Stepping Stones: at the quilter, made binding, which she will sew on for me and then I need to hand sew.
Jelly Roll Race: at the quilter. Needs binding, quilting, sleeve.
Wonky 9 Patch: needs quilting and binding.
Stars for San Bruno #2: Finished! YAY!
Pineapple: Abandoned; will remake blocks at a later time with more care.
Stars for San Bruno #3: Finished! YAY!
Food Quilt: Finished 5/24/2012. YAY!!!!
I am working steadily on the pink donation blocks. I have all 16 finished, though I just had 12 finished when I started writing this post.
I have the Corner Store on the portable design wall, so as soon as I finished the last donation block, I started to cut sashing. I haven’t cut all the sashing, but started to sew sashing onto donation blocks anyway in between sewing Corner Store blocks together.
I can’t see the blocks all together yet, because, as implied, both design walls are covered (could I, possibly, do fewer projects at once?) with other projects (A-B-C Challenge, Swoon, FOTY 2012, Corner Store).
I have about 6 blocks sashed and need to cut a bit more sashing.
In between sewing, I also cut some ~8″ pieces to make additional pink 2.5″ squares for a future donation quilt. I used the ~8″ pieces to cut 2.5″ squares using the Accuquilt. I have a big stack waiting for me to sort.
The blocks are all a bit different, but I used many of the same fabrics, as I did in the Blue Donation quilt.
I intended to make the top and back and give it in to the Charity girls at the BAMQG, but since my sewing machine seems so happy, I wonder if I could practice some free motion machine quilting on this piece? The last time I did free motion quilting, it was such a disaster that I might have developed a phobia. I have to see if I can do it…physically, too.
I am going to use the large piece on the left as backing. It is a very soft lawn, I think, and a bit thin, but I think it will be fine. Most of the fabrics Mrs. K sent were shards and strips. I washed them all and am preparing to cut them up into squares. A couple of the pieces, in addition to the lawn, are larger – FQ sized or so. Perhaps they will go on the back as well. We will see.
You know what this means, right? Yep, the 9000 was in the shop. Bleah.
Or so, I thought. It wasn’t really bad, though. I took the 9K to a place I used to take it to. The owner is a used car salesman kind of guy, but I wasn’t happy with the last service, so, at TFQ’s urging, I went back.
I took the machine in on a Friday and they called me SATURDAY to pick it up. I kid you not! I was amazed. The repair guy said that he had several similar machines to service, so he did them all at once. I went on Monday after work (2 hour round trip) to get it.
Houseguests arrived that very evening. You know what that means, right? No sewing. Yep.
No fabric pressing or fondling. Nothing.
I didn’t get to test the machine. I took everything down – iron, ironing board, cutting table and put it all in the closet. I am fortunate to have a husband who may not like it, but doesn’t complain about the way I have taken over the upstairs closet. I pinned the Corner Store pieces to the portable design wall and made the bed.
I didn’t get to test the machine until Friday. Yes, the following FRIDAY. Friday afternoon, as a matter of fact. I am glad I took it to the car salesman shop, though, because my sewing machine feels like her old self. The feet are actually holding the fabric to the bed of the machine. I had forgotten that it did that. The repair man said there was a belt problem.
I sewed like a demon on Sunday. Stay tuned for that report.",en,web
"Upholstered dining arm chairs – Dining chairs are used as seating at a dining table. They are available with weapons, called armchairs, and without weapons, called side chairs. They are fully padded, partly upholstered, and without upholstery. Upholstered dining arm chairs and side chairs are available in both fully-padded and partially upholstered styles. A fully padded chair has a seat and back that is padded and upholstered with fabric or leather while a partially padded chair has fabric on only the seat or only the back. When choosing padding for a dining chair. Choose a fabric that is durable and dirt-repellent to endure much food and drink spills over the years.
Make sure that the seat and arm height of your dining chairs work with your dining table. The upholstered dining arm chairs height of your chair should be 10 to 12 inches less than the height of your dining table. If you have chosen armchairs, make sure they slide completely under your dining table.
Sometimes the apron or edge of the table will drop more inches below the top of the table and block the arms of a chair slide downstairs. If you cannot try your upholstered dining arm chairs with your dining table. Make sure you get detailed measurements from the manufacturer including chair seat height, chair arm height, and countertop height.",en,reference

I have 3 acres of Syrah and Barbera, one row of Zin as well. Grapes are located in Auburn off of Mt. Vernon Road and were planted in 1990 and are ~25 years old with a history of producing great wine. This year they have been slightly neglected, but still have plenty of great grapes on them. You pick the grapes for $500 per ton, or $.50 per pound with a 100 lb minimum. Give me a call or text if you’re interested.
Contact Henry at 916 997-3056 or hbwilkinson@jps.net.
Cellar Master Henry Wilkinson is putting together 2 group buys for members only: petite sirah and petit verdot. Both varietals are sourced from Bokisch Vineyards in Lodi. Grapes are 75 cents per lb.
The varietals can be made as stand-alone varietals or as blending wines. Each varietal adds color and its own personality to other varietals. Petit verdot is often used in red Bordeaux blends to enhance the mid-palate, and petite sirah can add needed structure to many reds.
As both varietals make excellent blenders and topping wine, Henry offers to lead a “Blending Varietal Focus Group’ after the wines have aged.

"Charges of driving under the influence against Ravens cornerback Chris McAlister were dropped Tuesday afternoon in Virginia, McAlister's attorney, Bob Battle, confirmed.
McAlister was arrested and charged with DUI early on Aug. 18 in Fairfax County. Those charges were dropped after Battle filed a motion to dismiss in Fairfax County General Court.
Also dismissed was a charge against McAlister of refusing to submit to a breath test, according to the lawyer.
McAlister declined to talk about the case.
The only thing the player would talk about was the challenge he and the rest of the Ravens' secondary will have Sunday at M&T Bank Stadium against the Seattle Seahawks' receiving corps.
Each of Seattle's three primary receivers is in the top 25 in receiving yards in the NFC. Darrell Jackson is averaging 17.4 yards a catch, the highest of any receiver with more than 500 yards in the conference.
Jackson also ranks 10th in the conference with 660 receiving yards on 38 catches. Former first-round pick Koren Robinsion has 37 receptions for 530 yards, and third receiver Bobby Engram has 33 catches for 408 yards and three touchdowns.
""We just watch film and go out there and play,"" said McAlister of his unfamiliarity with the group.
""It's going to be even. They haven't seen me and I haven't seen them, so that's going to cancel itself out.""",en,web

"The world record held in Apex Legends for most kills by a squad in a single match has been broken by a team on Playstation 4.
The trio of players, whose in-game names are 'Gaitor_423,' 'Pensatas,' and 'ImCadillackin,' managed to get a whopping 45 eliminations in a single match.
This blows past the previous console world record of 40 kills in a single match, which was set by 'CruisingPaladin,' 'rickyjosephbarr,' and 'zcj,' on February 16, although those players were on the Xbox One.
In fact, not only is this new eliminations total a new world record for console players, it's a new world record outright, as their total also surpassed the 41 eliminations that PC players 'ssjfpsTV,' 'ItsScubby,' 'SHAAFFER' got on February 12.
The image above shows the remarkable statistics that the new record holders managed to accumulate in their record-breaking match.
To put into perspective exactly how impressive this feat is, just remember that there were only 57 other players on the map at the start, meaning that they eliminated over 78% of the entire lobby.
It would be hard to argue against ImCadillackin being named MVP of the match, considering he led the team in kills (19), damage dealt (2857), players revived (4), and players respawned (1).
This is the third record to have been broken in Apex Legends over the past two days, as former Overwatch pro player Mendokusaii set the record for most PC solo eliminations on February 19, the same day that a PS4 player set the same mark on console.
Since trios is the only mode currently available in Apex Legends, there is a limited amount of world records available for players to set and/or break, and you can check out the full list of current records by visiting our Apex Legends world records hub.
Do you think anyone will break the squad kill record anytime soon? Tweet us @Dexerto to let us know what you think!",en,web
"- Single engine versus twin, fuel cosumption, I have seen listings that said anywhere between 4 to 6 gph for a single and up to 10 to 12gph for a twin , is that pretty much standard?
- Inbaord or Inboard outboard, is an inboard more reliable than an i/o setup?
Thanks in advance for any help and or guidance.""
""Get the newer one if you can. Older boats have a lot more wood in them and you don&#39;t want that in the hull. It rots and becomes structurally unsound.
An I/O is less efficient than a direct drive or V drive. Any time the drive changes direction, energy is lost. As far as consumption, that will be determined by the hull design &#40;efficiency&#41; and the condition of the whole boat. If you&#39;re totally new to boating, get a complete marine survey of any boat you look at. If you&#39;re buying from a dealer, insist on one at their expense &#40;they should have done one anyway- how else would they know the real condition of their trade-ins?&#41;. If it&#39;s from a private owner, offer to split the cost after calling around to find out who&#39;s certified and available. It could save you thousands of dollars.""
""Thanks for the heads up, I&#39;m still confused on the fuel consumption, It only makes sense that a twin engine is going to burn more fuel than a single, but is it double? I was looking at a 34ft Uniflight with twin 270hp crusaders and was told it burned 6gph at cruisng speed &#40;12kts&#41; now I&#39;m not sure if they meant 6 total or 6 per engine.""
""There&#39;s only one real way to find out. Anything else is just guessing. Keeping it tuned up properly and the hull clean &amp; waxed will cut the consumption down and if you look around, there are performance upgrades that can save gas &amp; give you more power.""
Huh? The opposite is true, especially with dual prop drives.
Seeing this is your first boat, I&#39;d strongly suggest buying a &#34;common&#34; I/O single engined boat and learning about boating from it. Bayliners and others in the mid 20 foot range are plentiful and cheap to buy. And when you trade up, they are easier to sell.
We re-started in boating &#40;after a 30 year absence&#41; in a 19 footer, went to a 28, then the 32 we have now. Each step up raised the learning curve and the costs involved in running/ maintaining it.
If you are concerned about fuel costs &#40;I get that impression&#41;, a mid-20 footer like this will not frighten you off--expect 2 to 3 mpg from a single small block I/O boat in that size range. My 32 footer gets a best of 1.25 mpg--and it&#39;s good on gas for its size.
PS: We had the most fun with the 19 footer, and that&#39;s the truth.""
""Thanks again for all the info, we have started to narrow are search to 28 to 30ft and probably a single engine boat just to help cut operating costs. &#40;I am concerened about fuel, unless your name is Gates who wouldn&#39;t be&#41; I have been trying to shy away from and I/O boat because I have always heard that the maintenance on them was much higher than an inboard, is that a correct assumption?""",en,web
"Genomic imprinting results in the preferential expression of a gene from either the maternal or paternal allele. Nearly all imprinted domains express non-coding RNAs, including both long and small non-coding RNAs, in a parental biased manner. Yet, the physiological functions and molecular mechanisms of these imprinted transcripts are poorly characterized. Our lab aims to determine the cis- and trans-acting mechanisms of imprinted, non-coding RNAs in the brain.
We have established an in vitro system that enables detection and manipulation of allele-specific expression in neurons. We are currently using this system to (1) identify the neuronal targets of orphan snoRNAs, (2) delineate the neuronal networks regulated by imprinted miRNAs, and (3) determine the mechanisms by which imprinted long non-coding RNAs repress genes in cis.
Imprinted disorders arise from inappropriate genetic alterations within imprinted domains. We have previously shown that targeting an imprinted long non-coding RNA is a viable therapeutic strategy for treatment of an imprinted disorder. In the future, we will perform additional studies to examine the physiological role of imprinted non-coding RNAs during normal and dysregulated neurodevelopment.",en,academic
"Filter Driers Are Effective. Vastly Increase Their Effectiveness! Here's How!
Replaceable core filter driers give you a choice. A choice based upon the type contaminate present.
For normal system maintenance you can use a regular core. A core that performs routine removal of contaminates.
If water has entered the system you can select a high moisture removal core.
This core has additional water absorbing material to increase the amount held by the drier.
If a compressor burnout has occurred you can choose special burnout cores.
These cores have small amounts of a charcoal substance that neutralizes any acid in the system.
The question is, can they clean the refrigeration system?
The answer is yes, but at what cost?
Over the years I have seen some tremendously contaminated systems.
Extreme amounts of water and terrible compressor burnouts.
From experience, attempting to clean the system by core replacement only, is wasteful and ineffective.
While it's true the cores remove the contaminates, they do so very slowly. They do so in very small amounts.
The process is time consuming and expensive.
After installing the correct cores, change the oil!!
Run the system for a short interval and change the oil again. Run the system for a longer interval and (you guessed it) change the oil again.
Repeat, repeat, and repeat until the refrigeration oil returns to a virgin oil appearance.
Now replace the cores again.
That's how I clean a system.
Refrigeration oil travels through out the system during normal operation.
This traveling oil naturally washes contaminates back to the compressor crankcase.
Changing the oil repeatedly speeds up the cleanup!
So, yes the replaceable core filter driers are effective. They just need additional help in accomplishing their goal.",en,reference
"Lift stations contain pumps, valves, and electrical equipment necessary to pump water or wastewater from a low elevation to a high elevation. For example, a sewage lift station is used to pump sewage or wastewater up hill from a low-lying neighborhood to a collection system of pipes. Lift stations are also used in a variety of industrial settings, including mining and water management and treatment.Wastewater systems typically use gravity to transport waste from homes and businesses to provide water treatment at a central facility. For cities that have many changes in elevation, municipalities must use lift stations to pump the wastewater to a higher elevation. Lift stations pump storm water and sewage from low-lying areas, such as the parishes surrounding the city of New Orleans. A pump lift station is used in conjunction with other mitigating structures and features, such as canals and levees to manage storm water.
Lift stations are designed to handle a specific flow of water from rainfall, and many contain multiple pumps to manage a large drainage capacity, usually measured in cubic feet per second. A sewer lift station is frequently used by municipalities to control the sewage treatment across several areas or neighborhoods. A sewer lift station pumps the effluent to a collection area, ensuring that waste from lower elevation areas is processed.Lift stations for wastewater or storm water applications work in a similar way.
A wastewater lift station typically comprises a concrete well that is fitted with several submersible pumps. Lift station design also include incorporating level-sensing probes, valves and pressure sensors, and may also include a stand-by generator. Large storm water treatment facilities may have generator back-up for a pump station to ensure the proper drainage of water during a storm or power outage. Lift stations must function in harsh and corrosive environments and are typically made of precast concrete with the pumps and valves accessible through a hatch for cleaning and maintenance.",en,reference
"Frank Demer's database and that of the AIHA are terrific. Frank's stands out to me because of the institutional support, while the AIHA database is 'anonymous'--you don't know where the incidents occurred.
While I don't doubt many institutions do have a 'what happened/how to prevent it' review, that knowledge often appears to be kept within the institution. Whether this is for legal reasons, or the PR folks don't like to have this information available, or another reason, I don't know. And of course, from time to time C&E News will print letters from researchers about an experiment that should have been standard, but wasn't. What is particularly helpful about a database collated by EH&S is that you can see accidents that occurred in biology, biochem, neuroscience labs, etc. These are important chemical-use research areas where the researchers are not focused on the chemical aspects and might be reluctant to go to a ""Accidents in Chemistry Labs"" blog or even know about C&E News.
The ""we don't talk about it to outsiders"" response has happened to me personally as I tried to follow up with a college in New England regarding a chemical fire that was reported via the news. It hit home because a year or so earlier, they had contacted me about an accident here. I shared my details with them and other colleges in our New England Small Colleges Association, precisely so a repeat incident could be avoided elsewhere. Unfortunately their institution did not permit reciprocati on. And I think if you look at a number of these incidents, many which don't involve employees (and bring in OSHA) or which occur at private institutions (so no FOIA requirements) are not shared with the community beyond what is first reported in the news (and we know how helpful THAT is at getting to the root cause!) And they should be, at least in a database that shields the institution, if desired.
My personal opinion only, not legal or business advice, and may not be the opinion of my employer or any group to which I belong.
I take exception to suggesting that serious academic institutional/departmental follow-up response is not a normal part of the accident review. Many academic institutions have a process, consisting of root cause analysis and lessons learned. Making such a broad statement is counterproductive to the importance of safety.
I concur that realistic, repetitive training can go a long way to ameliorating panic reactions in emergency situations. Alas, the resources and institutional commitment for this sort of thing are lacking in most academic situations, and for some folks it just won't ever sink in.
I have never personally seen laboratory safety training materials discuss that the trainee or his/her coworkers may freeze, panic, or do something completely wrong in an emergency situation. A coworker's inappropriate reaction can not only be distracting or disorienting, it can compound an already bad situation. I encourage everyone to include this topic in their training courses.
Recent events (UCLA, Yale etc.) aside, I have never personally seen serious academic institutional/departmental follow-up response with Lessons Learned from minor accidents, major incidents, or near misses. Having a protocol for a formal analysis (What happened? Facts instead of departmental gossip. What went wrong? How could this be avoided? What SOP's should change? etc.), ensuring that the analysis is distributed to all possible stakeholders, and archiving it on an easily accessible web site is a great way of making sure that history does not repeat itself. I have the impression that this kind of analysis is the norm at places like DuPont, but, sadly, in my own personal experience, academic institutions often fail to do so either out of liability/publicity concerns, leadership inertia/vacuum, or both. Formal accident followups should be SOP and the importance of these should be stressed in academic safety training courses.
Finally, those archived incidents make great case studies that should be utilized in laboratory training. After giving the full spiel, take the time to pull out a couple of case studies and ask the trainees what should have been done, what could have been improved etc. Interactive training forces the trainees to think about the issues and the instructor achieves instant feedback on how effective the training has been. This makes training a much more interesting experience for both parties. If you are fortunate enough not to have any site-specific cases to use, a wealth of them are available at http://www.aiha.org/insideai ha/volunteergroups/labHandScommittee/Pages/LaboratorySafetyIncidents.aspx The unexpected dangers reported at http://pubs.acs.org/cen/safety/index.html also afford additional scenarios.

Click on the thumbnails in this post to open the full photos.
Our base was in Puerto de la Cruz on the northern coast of Tenerife. Neither of us had been in the Canary Islands before, and we chose the location based on what we’d heard – i.e. it’s far from the “Tourist Hell” of Playa de las Americas and Los Cristianos while also enjoying a much greener (which unfortunately also means wetter) climate. Many people seem to have the misconception that there is not much to see in the Canary Islands – or actually nothing to see. I also shared this prejudice to some extent before the trip and let me tell you – it’s so not true. For one, Tenerife is a hiking paradise with enough awesome routes to last for a month or two. Plus the islands aren’t called Hawai’i of the Atlantic for nothing either.
Puerto de la Cruz is a nice small city; nice in the sense that there’s a lot more going on than just tourists. It served as an excellent starting place for some island tours. While there is clean and reliable public transportation available to most parts of the island, having a car helped a lot. In the ten days or so we had a car, I drove over 1,000 kilometers which is quite a bit on an island that’s 100km from one end to the other.. However, whenever one leaves the only highway going two thirds around Tenerife, you enter hairpin curve territory and progress is often very slow. Thankfully all the roads were in very good condition.
I’d bought a Sunflower hiking guide beforehand, which served as a good guide to many excellent hikes in Tenerife. We were ill-equipped to handle the most strenuous hikes like climbing Mt. Teide, but found plenty of wonderful views along more humane hikes. For example, the photo on the right here was taken from a hike that circles Roque de Taborno near the village of Taborno on the Anaga Peninsula. The instructions in the guide were generally quite good and I think we only got lost a couple of times.. 😉 Even on the easier hikes, the paths were such that I’m sure some cultures would’ve put up plenty of warning signs like “WARNING: If you take one wrong step, you fall 200m and die.”, but most of the time things were okay. Still, there were plenty of hikes unsuitable for those suffering from vertigo.
The waves weren’t small everywhere, but luckily the huge waves were in areas where surfing would’ve been dangerous or suicidal. Check out the photo on the left, taken from a hill south of the city center in Puerto de la Cruz. There’s an awesome breaking wave and it looks perfect from afar. But take a look at the people walking on the coastline nearby and you get an idea on the size of this swell.. ouch.
The weather on our “wetter” coast was almost uninterrupted sunshine and temperatures hovering in the +20C to +25C range, so no complaints there. One nice surprise (for us anyway) that we discovered on any walks outside forests was that many places were teeming with small and medium-sized lizards like the one on the right here. Unfortunately we didn’t see any of the bigger lizards living on the island.
The number one natural attraction of the island is probably mount Teide, Spain’s tallest mountain at 3700m+. You’ll want to go here, but you do not want to hike up even from the 2,000m+-level to the 3,700m+ top unless you’re a very experienced hiker. Plus you now need a permit to get to the very top. However, there is a cable car running to almost the top to over 3,550m and a couple of great viewpoints (miradors) are within half an hours of walk up there. Also, the surrounding huge caldera offers some great walks and views of Teide, like the one on the left here. Note: Go early to the cable car station – so early that you’re at the lower cable car stop when it opens at 9am. We did, and were very very happy about it when we saw that a 2-3 hour queue had appeared by the time we descended a couple of hours later..
Go to Mount Teide. See above for notes.
Take some walks in the Anaga peninsula and/or the Orotova valley. There are walks of all difficulty levels and they offer some amazing views.
Visit Loro Parque, advertisements of which cannot be avoided on the island. Cool dolphin and orca shows as well as some nice exotic animals – of course, if you hate zoos, you may want to skip this.
Rent a car so you can drive around the island. Be prepared for slow traffic and plenty of hairpin curves outside the autopista (highway).
Shop for electronics if that’s your thing. The taxes are much lower than in continental EU and thus prices are something like 20-25% less than in, say, Finland. Luckily at least the northern part of the island was almost completely free from pushy salespeople, which was a relief.
Expect great food. See my earlier post about this nuisance.
Go to Playa de las Americas or Los Cristianos, nothing but tourists there. Unless, of course, you’re weird and like that kind of stuff.
Expect white sand beaches; the abovementioned resort cities have imported ugly sand and there’s only one beach – Playa de la Teresitas near Santa Cruz – that has nice light sand; imported from the Sahara, actually. All other beaches are composed of black lava sand which is quite coarse.
Visit the Aquatic Gardens (Jardin Aquatico) in Puerto de la Cruz. The first pool of water is nice enough but the rest of the place is completely run down and ugly. Definately not worth the â‚¬4 admission charge. Instead, visit the public gardens nearby, facing the city with waterfalls & all.
Expect people outside hotels and major attractions to speak much English. Learn some basic Spanish or take a dictionary with you.
Be surprised of the strong police presence; they’re much more visible than in e.g. Finland. Most of the time it’s nice and subsequently the crime rate is very low, but sometimes the presence can scare you. Like once when we were driving on twisty mountain road, we suddenly after one curve find a camouflaged guy wielding an automatic rifle in the middle of the road, signalling us to stop. Turned out to be a cop – some more official uniform would’ve been nice..
A couple of days before we left, there was a storm and the island got its only rain during our stay. This turned out to be a good thing, as Mt Teide also got a snow-cap from the storm which looked quite stunning – photographs just won’t do justice, just like they simply don’t convey the altitude differences in many of the pictures taken from our hikes.
While the lack of good food was a major disappointment (and a possible show-stopper for us to visit the place again), Tenerife was all in all a positive surprise with stunning scenery and providing excellent opportunities for an active holiday. The people were generally friendly and escaping to somewhere sunny and warm for a while is alwas a good experience.

"I am 52 years old and working as engineer. Responsibility is high. How many hrs do i need to sleep.
Normally sleeping 12.00 to 6.00. Is it sufficient.
1. Why not go to bed between 10 and 11 PM. You need 7 to 8 hours of sleep at night. It takes you 1 hour to reach deep REM sleep. It is between midnight and 3 AM that your pituitary gland gives you the daily burst of human growth hormone (HGH). This happens only during deep REM sleep.You need the HGH for sharp thinking, alertness and withstanding the stress of your job.
2. Your daughter is in a different time of her life. During youth you get away with sleep deprivation. But eventually she has to wake up to the same what I told you.She needs the burst of HGH release also and unfortunately this happens only from midnight to 3 AM once in a 24-hour period.",en,reference

"Artificial Intelligence has been a white hot topic in the Consumer Goods industry lately. Of equal importance, but far less discussed, the idea of emotional intelligence.
This is a critical skill, given that we have about 400 emotional experiences each day whether conscious or not. It impacts the way we see our self, the world around us, and affects how we pursue our goals. Therefore, understanding our emotions is the best way to produce the behavior we want to carry out.
Thankfully, recognizing our capability to exercise emotional intelligence is never too late. Unlike personality and IQ which are crystalized at a young age, emotional intelligence is flexible and responsive to change. The best part is, once you become aware of your emotions and take the blinders off, it becomes difficult not to do something productive with that.
In other words, it’s that added magic that some people possess that makes people want to work with them.
In the field of recruitment, noting the mere existence and power of emotional intelligence is an effective way of understanding people, their respective industries, and what environment they best fit into.
Research found that most candidates between middle management and CEO positions have the lowest rates of emotional Intelligence. Theories are that this is due to promotion being generally based on opportunity, timing, tenure, and short-term financial gains.
As recruiters, we know that pairing up talent with a job is not solely based on experience and qualifications, but also based on pairing personality within a specific team. When we interview candidates and speak to clients, we actively—even subconsciously—note cues like mannerisms, responses, how they portray themselves. Ultimately, this means we assess the emotional intelligence of the other person.
What differentiates the quality of work amongst recruiters is being able to recognize, find, and place well-rounded candidates, and not just those who have ticked the traditional boxes. This is crucial for the long-term success of a company, it’s productivity and cohesive work fabric.
Therefore, explicitly adding Emotional Intelligence to our toolbox is an effective way to make increasingly successful placements, promote stronger relationships with clients and becomes a useful strategy from a business development perspective.
Reminding a candidate that they possess emotional intelligence and can use it as a tool to find and hold down a new opportunity is crucial.
Avoid artificial sleep aids (the three glasses of wine at the end of the day or the melatonin bottle some people use to initially fall asleep). They impair your body’s ability to naturally remove toxic proteins and long-term ability to do so.
Lighting: Morning time is full of blue wavelengths light and wakes up your body, evening time is full of red and orange which sparks the creation of melatonin. That natural process gets disturbed when we flood our brain with blue light again by watching tv or lingering on the iPad. This affects sleep quality immediately and over time.",en,reference

"Inspired by the “Stories” theme of World Refugee Day, they shared personal testimony, family stories and special messages to highlight the challenges faced by refugees, but also their courage and resilience.
In the week that UNHCR reported that global forced displacement had passed the 50 million mark for the first time since World War II, celebrities shone a spotlight on the individual stories behind the statistics, using traditional and social media to spread the World Refugee Day message.
UNHCR Special Envoy Angelina Jolie marked WRD by visiting the Ban Mai Nai Soi camp in northern Thailand. Goodwill ambassadors (GWA) Alek Wek and Khaled Hosseini, both former refugees, shared their personal reflections and stories of refugees they had met in the field. Joining them were other members of the GWA family: Yao Chen, Osvaldo Laport, George Dalaras, Aidos Sagat and Honorary Lifetime Goodwill Ambassador Barbara Hendricks.
Thirty-three high profile UNHCR supporters, hailing from 20 countries, recorded public service announcements calling on people to heed this “most urgent story of our times.” They included Peruvian Nobel Prize for Literature winner Mario Vargas Llosa, singer Juanes from Colombia, footballers John Obi Mikel and James Rodrigues, the cast of the hit TV series “The Vampire Diaries,” Chinese actress Yao Chen, Thai musician Cherman Boonyasak, Canadian songwriter Chantal Kreviazuk and South Korean Jung Woo Sung. They reached out to millions.
Celebrities also shared moving and inspiring personal stories and testimony, including British actress Emma Thompson and her adopted son Tindy Agaba, a former refugee from Rwanda. Joining her were Pakistani human right activist Malala Yousafzai as well as European screen stars Diane Kruger, David Morrissey, Romola Garai and Ewan McGregor, United States film director Wes Anderson, singer-songwriter Maher Zain, UK broadcasters Emma Freud and Yasmin Alibhai-Brown, footballer Saido Berahino, award-winning architect Sir Richard Rogers, athletes Lopez Lomong and Guor Maker, and acclaimed authors Henning Mankell, Neil Gaiman, Esther Freud, Marina Lewycka and Judith Kerr.
The celebrities generated media coverage worldwide. Yao Chen released a powerful documentary in China, featuring her recent visit to Lebanon to meet Syrian refugees. The British writer Gaiman was featured in an exclusive interview on Yahoo; GWA Wek shared her thoughts with Marie Claire magazine, actress Kat Graham spoke passionately on US television, and Goodwill Ambassador Hosseini was interviewed by Al Jazeera.
A social media buzz was also driven by high profile supporters. Their promotion of UNHCR’s World Refugee Day Thunderclap helped it to achieve an audience reach of more than 11 million, whilst tweets and posts from the likes of Laport, Stephen Fry, Paulo Coelho, Livia Firth, Ed Norton, Coldplay, Juanes, and many others achieved social media impressions of more than 150 million.
On World Refugee Day (June 20), Kat Graham took part in a WRD concert at the Kennedy Centre for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C., and witnessed a naturalization ceremony for refugees in Atlanta. Across the Atlantic, in Africa, Malian musician Rokia Traoré sang and danced with refugees at Goudoubo Refugee Camp in Burkina Faso.

"Glenfarclas 21 year-old single malt is like drinking Sherried velvet.
Glenfarclas 21 Year Old is rich and thick with a heavy influence of the Sherry casks it has aged in for more than two decades. In many ways, this fine single malt is a classic Speyside-style Whisky. But in other ways it is totally different. The complex aromas and fruitiness are there like other Speyside spirits, but there is a buttery richness that stands out uniquely. And the full bodied mouth-feel is nearly Liqueur-like in texture, but the flavors are balanced and well-rounded.
What does Glenfarclas 21 Year Old taste like?
The Flavor Spiral™ shows the most common flavors that you'll taste in Glenfarclas 21 Year Old and gives you a chance to have a taste of it before actually tasting it.
Deeply complex with notes of caramel apples, banana, rancio, warm pecans, buttery malt, and more.
Rich with dark chocolate raisins and figs with toffee and a little smoke.
Interesante. Aromas a frutas secas y madera. Retrogusto potente.
How do you know what monkey piss tastes like?
I rate whisky by taste. As this was from a sherry cask, and I love whiskies from sherry casks it was perfect.
Go with the 12 year. Can taste a bit of the raisin here. Good. But not twice as good as the 12.
I must say I disagree. I feel the spirit came to fruition in 21 years. The 12 is also an excellent choice. But mmm that 21. The 25 is not so much worth the jump in price in my humble opinion.
Nice! Full flavored and sweet with a touch of brandy and fruitiness.
Not my cup o tea, it is probably one of the best for those with tolerable palats, but it was a little too harsh in the finish for me.
Literally one of the greats.

"Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) what has the brain to do with it?
The New York Times always has some good articles in its health section which I enjoy reading. One such article which I read recently was titled ” Let the mind help tame an irritable bowel” by Jane E. Brody. I think everyone who suffers from IBS should read this well written piece. Ms. Brody discusses the role played by the brain in IBS by highlighting the intimate connection between the gut and the brain.
When we talk about the nervous system most people are only familiar with the central nervous system (CNS) (brain and spinal cord) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS) (peripheral nerves which control the movements of the limbs and help to transmit sensation like pain, temperature and touch from the periphery back to the brain). In addition to the CNS and the PNS, there is another nervous system which plays an equally important role. This is referred to as the autonomic nervous system (ANS). The ANS is the system which helps to maintain functions like sweating, blood pressure, erectile function and functioning of the smooth muscles of the gut among numerous other functions. This system is essentially involuntary meaning not under our voluntary control.
The brain and the gut are intimately connected and this has being referred to as the brain-gut axis. The small and large bowel are richly innervated with nerve fibres transmitting information to and from the brain. The secretory functions of the gut are controlled by the brain though neurotransmittors like serotonin and hormones such as gastrin, somatostatin, secretin, cholecystokinin and neuropeptides. Thus in essence the gut is under the control of the supercomputer aka ” BRAIN”.
People who have IBS have symptoms of bloating, flatulence, diarrhoea, abdominal pain and constipation. They usually fall into two broad categories: 1)in which diarrhoea symptoms predominate 2) in whom constipation symptoms predominate. When these people seek medical help a work up is initiated to determine the etiology. As doctors we want to rule other diseases which may mimic the presentation of IBS. It is specially important to rule out tumors of the gut (colon cancer etc ) hence in some patients a colonoscopy may be ordered. It is also important to rule out inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) such as Ulcerative Colitis and Crohn’s disease.
If after work-up nothing “organic/ structural” is found, the diagnosis of IBS is entertained. No one yet knows what causes IBS, why some people have it and others don’t. One of the theories is that in people who have IBS either the nerves or the smooth muscles of the gut are extra-sensitive. They respond differently (as compared to people who do not have IBS). Another theory is that the nerves and smooth muscles perse are fine, it is the brain which processes the signals it gets from the gut differently.
As Ms. Brody rightly points out in her article (www.nytimes.com) this does not mean IBS is a psychosomatic condition. For a long time these patients were misunderstood and tagged as being too emotional, “it is all in your mind meaning psychological” and “there is nothing wrong with you” labels. Now we know this is not true though we still do not know what the underlying problem is. We do know that IBS symptomatology is exacerbated by emotional upsets meaning symptoms worsen at the times of stress. Large meals, change in diet, eating a diet rich in wheat, barley or milk products, drinking too much coffee and tea or an overindulgence in alcohol can lead to a flare up of symptoms.
So if the brain plays such a big role in the symptomatology of IBS, can we harness the power of the brain/mind to control this disease? IBS should be the ideal disease to demonstrate the power of mind-body medicine. Well yes and no. To some extent therapies like hypnosis, meditation, yoga and massage help. Controlling your response to stress is also helpful (how you deal with stressful situations, knowing which triggers to avoid-stress at work, at home, in a relationship etc). A very important role is played by dietary modifications-knowing your triggers and knowing which foods to eat and how much and which to avoid.
Medicines are there, unfortunately they do not abate the underlying disease though they certainly help in controlling the symptoms. If you have diarrhoea predominant IBS, your doctor may prescribe an anti-diarrhoeal agent along with probiotics (once infective causes of diarrhoea have been ruled out by stool cultures). Constipation predominant IBS patients may be helped by increasing the fiber in their diet or by the judicious use of laxatives.
A combination of the above therapies (mind-body medicine and allopathic drugs) works best. After all that is what is referred to as holistic medicine.

"You may ask what articulation is, and what it has to do with you. As a Valencia student, you have options as to where you would like to continue your academic career. The State of Florida already has an articulation agreement between community colleges and the eleven State universities (6A-10.024). This agreement states that any student who graduates with an A.A. Degree will be accepted to one of the eleven state universities. However, the articulation agreement does not guarantee that a student will be immediately accepted into the major of his/her choice within that university. In addition, the agreement guarantees acceptance into one of the state universities, but not necessarily the student's first choice (please refer to Transfer Guarantees for additional information).
The Pre-Majors are included in the Associate in Arts Degree section of the catalog, and by clicking on the Pre-Majors and General Studies link below or on the Navigation Bar on the left side of the screen.

The ideal D-dimer method comparison is based on results obtained with both/all assays on the same samples and when all test persons are examined with a confirmatory method.
Less ideal is a comparison based on results obtained with both/all assays on the same samples where only all the test persons with discrepant results (below cut-off with one assay, above cut-off with the other assay) are examined with a confirmatory method.
When a new D-dimer method is to be implemented either as a substitute for a currently used D-dimer assay or as a supplement, maybe as a point-of-care assay, it is necessary to do a clinical comparison of the ""old"" assay versus the ""new"" assay.
Comparing D-dimer assays is challenging. First of all a comparison should be primarily a clinical comparison because the specificities for D-dimer assays can be in the range from 30 to above 90 % [1, 2]. As the number of false-positives is equal to 100 % minus specificity, it can be seen that a relatively high number of false-positives seems to be accepted. The main reason for this is that a D-dimer test is used for ruling out VTE in low-risk patients and that patients with a positive test are examined with a confirmatory method (imaging) .
The challenges come from the fact that D-dimer is not a standardized method . There exists no reference method and there are no international standards available. Furthermore, the D-dimer molecules belong to a heterogeneous group of molecules. This means that it should be known which method was used to interpret a result, and you cannot directly compare two results obtained with different methods.
Several issues have to be taken into consideration to make a comparison scientifically reliable.
Caution should be exercised when comparing two or more D-dimer methods between studies based on data in literature. In this context literature includes articles in peer-reviewed journals and the information given in 510(k) summaries/decision summaries from the FDA and in manufacturer’s inserts.
Is the chosen gold standard used in all patients?
The mixture of these conditions is most often not known or disclosed in published studies.
Many elevated samples due to other causes than DVT or PE will have a strong negative influence on the specificity of an assay. Furthermore, testing on groups with a high incidence of elevated D-dimer due to other causes may also have an influence on sensitivity. In a patient with a D‑dimer elevation above the cut-off due to reasons other than DVT or PE, a small DVT may be detected due to the elevation, which was present even before the DVT.
This gives a false increase in the measured clinical sensitivity.
Prevalence has an impact on the predictive values of a test. This can be seen by simple theoretical calculations.
and we test four different populations, all with 100,000 individuals but with different prevalence of disease, we get differences in predictive values.
As the prevalence increases, so does the positive predictive value, while the negative predictive value decreases.
Hospitals may group patients into low-pretest-probability, medium-pretest-probability and high-pretest-probability patients. The pretest probabilities of DVT for these groups are often given as 3 %, 17 % and 75 % .
However, at one hospital the true prevalence of DVT in the low-pretest-probability group may be 7 %, at another hospital it may be 1 %. This means that the calculated NPV at one site would be several percentage points lower than at the other site due solely to the differences in prevalence (all other factors being equal).
Ideally, the ability of a test to correctly identify patients with and without a specific disease should not vary between patients. However, the spectrum of disease found among patients in the population upon which the test is to be used will often have an influence on the clinical performance of the test.
Therefore performance measures apply only to populations having a similar spectrum of disease to that used to estimate the performance measures .
The spectrum of disease for VTE patients is primarily determined by the site of the DVT , distal (calf veins) or proximal (thigh veins) and whether PE is present or not.
A DVT in the calf veins is usually smaller and gives rise to lower D-dimer concentrations than a DVT in the thigh veins . For this reason the risk of getting a false negative result is larger when the DVT is distal compared to the risk when the DVT is proximal.
Most D-dimer studies are performed in hospitals on patient populations with a predominance of proximal DVT. In an outpatient study including 393 patients with clinically suspected symptomatic DVT of the lower extremities  a total of 137 of 393 patients had a proven DVT and the majority (59 %) presented with distal DVT.
Twenty-eight out of 81 patients with distal DVT had a normal D-dimer, compared with two of 56 patients with proximal DVT. The sensitivity for distal DVT was only 65 % compared with 96 % for proximal DVT; the negative predictive values were 84 % and 99 %, respectively.
PE is usually associated with a higher D-dimer concentration than a DVT without PE . This means that clinical sensitivities, specificities and predictive values cannot be compared between studies focusing on PE and DVT, respectively.
A comparison of either clinical sensitivities or specificities without the other parameter is an arbitrary one, since changing the cut-off can increase sensitivities or specificities at the expense of lowering the other parameter . A joint comparison of clinical sensitivity/specificity pairs may still be meaningful if the sensitivity and specificity of one method are both higher than the sensitivity and specificity of the other method.
The figures above are examples of the trade-off between clinical sensitivity and specificity. When 400 µg/L is chosen as cut-off, the sensitivity is 100 % and the specificity is 54 %. When the cut-off is increased to 500 µg/L, the sensitivity decreases to 92 % and the specificity increases to 79 %.
The gold standard used to establish a VTE diagnosis is usually based on either ultrasound or angiography/venography.
Ultrasound has a limited ability to image the calf veins where the thrombi are smaller . This means that there is a risk of classifying patients with calf DVT as non-sick. This will give bias such as falsely increased sensitivity and negative predictive value because a negative D-dimer in combination with a false negative ultrasound DVT test will be registered (in error) as a true negative test.
A review of 26 studies  shows up to 9.2 % differences in NPV for each D-dimer test when evaluated versus a diagnostic test detecting all clots, and when evaluated versus a test detecting primarily the clots in the thigh.
It is also important to notice if all test persons were examined with a confirmatory method. In some studies only patients with a positive D-dimer test are examined with a confirmatory method. VTE is often asymptomatic, misdiagnosed, and unrecognized at death .
Some estimates of the likelihood of diagnosing DVT are as low as 10 %. Due to a lack of routine post-mortem examinations it is difficult to estimate the true incidence of VTE. We can only say that it is underestimated.
The fact that VTE is underestimated is also supported by a meta-analysis finding that ~70 % of the major (either fatal or contributing to death) pulmonary embolic events diagnosed at autopsy had been missed by the attending clinicians .
Falsely increased sensitivity and negative predictive value may be seen when a person has a negative D-dimer and a DVT that is not detected due to lack of examination.
The ideal D-dimer method comparison is based on results obtained with both/all assays on the same samples and when all tests persons are examined with a confirmatory method.
It should be kept in mind that a comparison based on results obtained with both/all assays on the same samples can be directly used to compare the relative performances of the assays, but the relative performances may be different if the assays are tested on another population with a different prevalence, a different spectrum of disease, etc.",en,academic

"Ann Arbor is a city in Michigan and the county seat of Washtenaw County. Ann Arbor is the 5th largest city in Michigan and its Metropolitan Statistical Area includes all of Washtenaw County. The city just barely made the cut-off for the 5th largest city, making the new ranking sometime in 2012.
Ann Arbor has an estimated population of 121,000, although the metropolitan area, and all of Washtenaw County, has a population estimated at 350,000. Ann Arbor is also part of the Detroit-Ann Arbor-Flint, MI Combined Statistical Area (CMA), which has a population of more than 5.32 million.
The city proper has a population density of 4,094 people per square mile, which makes it less densely populated than the inner-ring Detroit suburbs of Ferndale and Oak Park, among others, but more densely populated than outer-ring suburbs.
The most common ancestry groups in Ann Arbor are German (14.9%), English (8.5%) and Irish (7.9%). Ann Arbor currently has the second-highest Japanese national population in Michigan at 1,540.
In 2013, Ann Arbor&apos;s population grew to 116,000, up 2% from 113,900 in 2010. This is due, in part, to new downtown high-rises with thousands of new units. Ann Arbor is expected to continue its modest growth in the decade to come.
Ann Arbor was founded in 1824 by Elisha Walker Rumsey and John Allen, and the town was registered with Wayne County as Annarbour that year. The city was named for the men&apos;s wives, both named Ann, and for large stands of burr oak in the land purchased from the government for $800.
Ann Arbor became the seat of Washtenaw County three years later and it was incorporated as a village just six years later. The Ann Arbor Land Company set aside undeveloped land and offered it to Michigan as the site of the state capital, but the bid was lost to Lansing and the property instead became the site of the University of Michigan, which shaped the future of the city.
Ann Arbor saw strong growth in the 1880s with new immigrants from Poland, Russia, Italy and Greece joining the Irish, Germans, English and African-Americans already present. Ann Arbor eventually gained a reputation as a center for liberal politics during the 1960s and 1970s, particularly for the civil rights and anti-Vietnam War movements.
Ann Arbor has one of the youngest median ages (28) among major U.S. cities.
Ann Arbor was listed as one of the most livable cities in the U.S. by Forbes in 2010.
The city has over 50,000 trees along its streets and the same number in its parks, hence its nickname, Tree Town.
The city has one of Michigan&apos;s highest foreign-born populations (17.4%) due to the University of Michigan.
Borders Books was started in Ann Arbor and headquartered in the city until it shut down in 2011. Other Ann Arbor-based companies include Domino&apos;s Pizza and Zingerman&apos;s Delicatessen.

"WASHINGTON — In a few weeks, the movie “Crazy Rich Asians” will premiere, and the opulent wealth will likely induce money envy.
I loved the book on which the film is based, but there were times when I got a little jealous reading about people who have so much money that they don’t have to start looking for the best airline prices nine months before a trip.
There are folks so rich that they have never had to repack two suitcases while checking into a flight to avoid paying $50 for an overweight bag. They have their own plane, and they can buy a new wardrobe whenever they vacation.
Some people are so wealthy they can change houses like others change shoes.
We don’t live in the age of keeping up with the Joneses, whom we only envied because they could go to Jamaica on holiday. We live in the age of Instagram, where we can see the kind of wealth that makes the Joneses look like paupers in comparison. We have the Kardashians and their constant drumbeat of postings showing a posh life we’ll never have.
Overexposure to the rich and famous can make you feel bad about what you have.
Recently, I received an email from a reader who wanted help to stop trying to keep up with a rich relative.
Still there’s a problem: money envy.
A recent survey by Credit Karma found nearly 40 percent of young adults said they’ve spent money they didn’t have to keep up with their friends.
Old, young or in between, there’s a strong pull to try to keep up. But comparing yourself to others, striving to have what they have, can lead to poor financial decisions. Think about your credit-card debt.
I appreciated the transparency from this reader about her feelings of not having enough.
Here’s how to stop trying to keep up with people with more money than you: Be grateful.
I’m privileged to see behind the curtain. And I say that because seeing the truth keeps my covetousness in check.
When I sit down with people to go over their budgets or help couples address their financial differences, I see what their money can’t buy.
Out front you see their big homes, expensive clothes, fancy cars or cruise trips – things they can easily afford. But behind the mask of material wealth are often personal deficits – unhappiness, infidelity, depression, drug or alcohol addiction, or troubled children.
Look for the luxuries in your life. Live your financial truth. I know it sounds simple, but when your eyes are big with wonder at another’s wealth, you might gloss over your own good fortune.",en,web
"RABAT (AFP) - Morocco's navy on Thursday (Dec 27) rescued 367 mostly sub-Saharan migrants in the Mediterranean sea after they attempted to reach Spain, a military source told AFP.
The rescued migrants included women and children who were ""in difficulty on board several makeshift vessels"", the source said.
""They were all brought back safely by navy units to the nearest ports.""
Morocco stopped 68,000 attempted illegal migrants and dismantled 122 ""active criminal networks"" in the first nine months of 2018, according to a recent official count.
Alongside migrants arriving from sub-Saharan Africa, an increasing number of young Moroccan citizens have attempted to leave the country on board inflatable dinghies in recent months.
At least 769 migrants have died attempting to cross the western Mediterranean since the start of the year, according to the International Organisation for Migration (IOM), after 224 died on this route in 2017.
The IOM says that more than 55,000 migrants have arrived in Spain by sea this year.",en,web
"I bought a skein of Malabrigo laceweight yarn the other day. I couldn’t resist it, in all its soft soft brightness. After rejecting every stitch pattern in the Harmony Guides on Friday, I woke up this morning, made coffee, and let the yarn do the talking. I sat all morning with it, and am even now itching to get back to it. I think I’m in love.
And so that’s the “obsessed” part of this post title. Here’s the catching up part.
Coincidentally (really!), while we were there the owner of the store was learning how to crochet so she can make a Babette Blanket.
When I haven’t been crocheting the scarf today, I’ve been reading What is the What for our next book club. I didn’t like the last book we read, but I love this one. Like deep down, think-it’s-genius love. I have a pile of books waiting to be read, but I’m savouring this one word for word. Which isn’t so great, because I have to finish it by next week.
I’m still working on my Gathered Pullover. I finished the body and started the first sleeve. When I’ve finished the scarf, I’m sure I’ll dive back into it.
Aaaand. There you have it.

"When I run my function.
Then return a list of tuples, where the regexp matches the search text. Each 'matching' tuple consists of the regexp, and an array of the captured elements of the text.
We can't just do if (@captures) because some regexps will be non-capturing.
Now this worked in all unit and integration tests I had to throw at the problem. The problem started when the code was finally integrated into the larger application (a mod_perl-based web service).
This seemed to work under a test harness, even with end-to-end integration and many regexp examples. However it was seen to fail badly when deployed under mod_perl.
Reading the docs, it appears that the $& variable is not guaranteed to be set of there is no match. Basically, it is only reset (along with all other capture variables) if there is an overall match.
Also, to my shame, I hadn't realised how poorly-performing the $& variable could be.
(we only expect to match a few cases on each iteration) I was surprised there wasn't a special array to hold all captures from a regexp result.
Interesting... two cases can return essentially the same array.
I'm not a power-user by any means, so I approached Perl Monks to ask about disambiguating native integers from their string representation, although I could be pretty sure it would be easy enough via Perl internals.
Through this line, I was given alternative suggestions for the regexp problem. The main pointer was the capture position arrays @- and @+, which I hadn't encountered before.
What I learned was that it's useful to re-read perlretut occasionally as a reminder of the power of the regexp engine but also as a guide to best practice.
Here's a slightly simpler approach. As you note, if a regex has no captures, matching against it in list context produces a list containing the single element 1. This means that list assignment of the match result will have a truth status that accurately reflects whether the match succeeded. But then the problem you've discovered is that you have a spurious excess value in your capture array.
The documentation for the @- variable says: ""One can use $#- to find the last matched subgroup in the last successful match. Contrast with $#+, the number of subgroups in the regular expression."" So this is exactly what you want: a list context match (so you don't need to explicitly loop over the captures), but only as many captures as actually matched.
Here, I blog mostly about Perl. I trade in Perl and Java. I like Moo(se) and testing stuff. I worry I'm not perllish enough at times.",en,code

"I was asked recently, ""What influences you to read a book?"" Perhaps my immediate response was shallow and non-thinking. I look at the cover and determine if it’s worth opening the page. But what do I see that makes that determination? Is it just the picture, or the layers of intrigue or the unfinished questions? I can usually pick out a book by a certain publisher; their style and photography have their own fingerprint. Other books I put down because of their simplistic drawings and homey appeal, many by another predictable publisher.
Have I missed good books by judging too sternly?
How do you choose a book? What draws you to pick up one book over another? Can we truly say that we shouldn’t judge a book by its cover? When you look at a cover, what makes you pick up the book and say, “I’ll read this”? Or “I don’t think so.” Is it just the cover design and picture?
What storyline grabs you and draws you to start reading before you’ve purchased the book or left the library? What criteria must a book meet for you to say, “This looks like a good one”? Do you look for action, mystery, unanswered questions, relationships, a fairytale book to allow you to escape and show you something works out well?
What book, even if it is not your normal book category, grabbed you and demanded that you read it…and you were not sorry?
Perhaps the response is as varied as the people that read…but is there a common thread that leads all readers to one book? The book that says it all.
The Founding Fathers desired that all men could read so that they could read the Bible. It was their guidebook to instill responsibility, accountability, justice, and love toward mankind and God. Man was to be thoroughly equipped for every good work. Has that one book changed?
What one book, would you recommend, above all others, for everyone to read for the answers to life’s problems, for the comfort to life’s sorrows, for the example of how to live life? Is the promise too good to be true?
Perhaps this article hasn’t been my thoughts, but the questions of a wondering mind. I seek to look into the reader’s mind and see what book will grab them and not let me go even after they put it down and walk away? Your turn, tell me.",en,books
"“That doesn’t make it okay,” I’d say, snatching the jade polyester pantsuit complete with double D-sized shoulder pads from her hands.
There were the boxes of black and white photos of family members we never knew, a closet of frightening porcelain ballerinas and swans and stacks of new candles, potpourri and tea that Mom collected just in case she needed a present at the last minute.
Based on the tea’s expiration date, Mom hasn’t needed a last-minute gift since 1992.
But it’s not entirely Mom’s fault. Admittedly, I’ve made some contributions, too–in the form of wedding china (an entire set that one day will look very nice if I ever pass through my Danish modern phase and embrace Victorian). And Mom has kept every Mother’s Day card I’ve ever written on, every report card I ever received and every tooth I’ve ever lost.
But even I draw the line somewhere.
“You can’t get rid of that!” I screamed, grabbing the alien costume I wore when I was five.
“I don’t think it still fits,” Mom said.
I can remember Mom taking my sister and me in our costumes to the roller rink for a Halloween party–but she had the wrong day. No one was dressed up. Other kids pointed and laughed at us as we skated around the rink, biting through our lower lips and wiping away hot tears. But it was worth all the pre-Halloween humiliation when the actual day rolled around; those handmade costumes were that cool.
Today Mom sifted through our box of costumes–a collection of capes, ill-fitting shoes and wigs, one with chicken bones tied into it. From the contents of that box we transformed into pirates, genies, geishas, witches, bikers, hookers, aliens, farmers, Madonna, Cleopatra look-alikes and cavewomen (hence the chicken-bones). Being boxed up and stashed in the attic for the better part of my life, the contents of the box smelled musty. And I’m pretty sure they’re haunted.
But those costumes instantly took me back to some of my best childhood memories. Each Halloween, we’d haul out the box and come up with that year’s costume. It was a ritual and one I’m not quite ready to give up.
Unlike potpourri and stale tea, this stuff has real use. Watching my daughter joyfully step into my costumes was like stepping back in time. I saw myself in her, complete with green hood and bobble antennae. Will we ever really need this stuff one day? Yes. In fact, we needed it today.",en,books
"Underdog Arnold Garde scored the biggest victory of his career on Sunday, March 12, when he won the vacant World Boxing Federation (WBF) Asia Pacific Light Flyweight title with a close split decision over fellow Filipino Ronie Tanallon at the T´Boli Covered Court in T´Boli, Philippines.
Headlining “T´Boli Thunder 2” promoted by Sanman Promotions, It was a very competitive fight throughout all ten rounds, but Garde secured the victory when he scored a knock-down inside the final ten seconds of the fight, flooring Tanallon with a right uppercut.
Tanallon, nicknamed “Ultimate Warrior”, did his moniker justice as he beat the count of referee Ramuel Ovalo, but time ran out for Garde to follow up. However, it would turn out that winning the final round by 10-8 was the deciding factor for Garde.
Two judges, Jaime Mata and Sabas Ponpon, had him winning by scores of 95-94 and 96-93 respectively, while judge Romy Fordaliza voted for Tanallon by 95-94. Had Tanallon won the final round, which it could be argued he was on his way to, he would have been the winner by majority decision.
Garde, who showed his class when he lost a competitive decision to former world champion Randy Petalcorin in his last outing, improved his professional ledger to 8-4-2 (3). Tanallon, the reigning Philippines champion at Strawweight, drops to 10-4-1 (2).",en,web
"Re: Arabs seek recognition for Palestine capital in East Jerusalem: Jordan”, World, January 8.
In The Nation’s January 8 issue, readers were treated to shocking news: the Hashemite kingdom of Jordan is promoting an Arab League initiative to gain international recognition of Jerusalem as the Palestinian capital.
Why is this item shocking? Because Jordan had almost two full decades to do just that. Jordan ruled over East Jerusalem from 1948 till 1967. The reasonable thing to do is ask why Jordan did not designate Jerusalem as the Palestinian capital back then? One suspects that Jordan’s move now is more anti-Israel than pro-Palestinian.

"Last month I had the opportunity to experience Seattle’s Upstream Music Fest + Summit. It was the second edition of the festival created by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen. The festival features a collection of up-and-coming artists across almost all genres. Most artists are based in Washington State, but there were a number from Oregon, California and decent Canadian contingent.
Victoria concert-goers who have gone to Rifflandia would find the vibe at Upstream somewhat familiar. Shows are spread out at multiple venues all within a few blocks in Seattle’s Pioneer Square area of the city with two major stages in a parking lot behind Century Link Field, the home stadium for the Seattle Seahawks NFL team and Seattle Sounders MLS team.
The lineup for each stage was curated by guest curators ranging from publications like Consequence of Sound, record companies like Sub Pop Records and Barsuk Records and even Victoria’s Do250 who curated a ‘Canada House’ stage with Vancouver’s Do604.
Upstream isn’t just a music festival. It also has a summit portion providing a number of workshops and guest speakers for aspiring musicians to learn from experts working in the industry. Some sessions we attended included one where Seattle DJ/Producers ODESZA spoke about life on tour, a session with band managers speaking about their roles, and a “fireside” chat with Krist Novoselic where he spoke about his life with Nirvana and what he has done after the grunge years.
Band managers give insight at an Upstream Summit session.
Local radio station KEXP recorded performance sessions with select bands in the festival lineup for broadcast and on YouTube. I had the opportunity to take some photos during Little Dragon’s session the first day of the festival before their main set.
The first Seattle artist I checked out was Judd Wasserman who performed in Occidental Park in the heart of Pioneer Square. A small tented stage was set up in the plaza that had tables, chairs and even ping pong tables.
Music kicked off at The Sound Lot at 5pm with Toronto’s Charlotte Day Wilson followed by Superduperkyle and Little Dragon. With festival wristbands having full in-and-out privileges I left part way through Little Dragon to check out some of the other venues. To get in an out of venues, security had to scan the RFID wristbands with what must have been an app on cell phones using Bluetooth. Unfortunately there were a number of occasions where wristbands just wouldn’t scan properly causing some delays at entrances.
The first smaller venues I frequented all weekend was Victoria’s Do250/Vancouver’s Do604’s ‘Canada House’ at Quality Athletics. Quality Athletics is a sports bar/restaurant that is one block away from Century Link Field. The stage was set up directly in front of the kitchen. The music lineup included artists from Vancouver, Vernon, Edmonton, Winnipeg and Regina/Saskatoon. The first night included performances by Nuela Charles, Schwey and Dear Rouge. Saturday had Samurai Champs, Little Destroyer and Five Alarm Funk, and Sunday had sets by Snotty Nose Rez Kids, Living Hour, daysormay, and Yukon Blonde. Toronto female rap group The Sorority and Vancouver hip-hop duo So Loki were originally in the lineup, but unfortunately were forced to cancel their appearances. Attendance ranged from medium-sized crowds to jam packed with a line outside for Five Alarm Funk. Sunday’s attendance numbers were lower due to the first couple bands bands having to perform opposite headliner The Flaming Lips.
Soul singer Grace Love performed at The Lower Quarters at 13 Coins which is an underground bar space under 13 Coins restaurant. Love began her set singing acapella before bringing up a band to back her up.
After a few songs I walked back to The Sound Lot for the evening’s headliner Miguel.
The Helio Sequence performed in a ballroom at the Embassy Suites Hotel. It felt a little strange taking hotel elevator and entering a carpeted room to see a concert, but a venue’s a venue.
My Friday was capped off with The Seshen performing at Central Saloon, a long narrow bar with a stage at the back.
My Saturday kicked off observing a KEXP session featuring Hot Snakes. Photographers were not allowed in this time around so all I could do is listen from outside.
Music at The Sound Lot kicked off with Seattle’s Tacocat on the main stage. Having seen them at Coachella and Rifflandia, they’re a fun indie punk band to watch and take photos of with their colourful hair and attire.
From there I left The Sound Lot to take in Kristen Marlo and Heather Thomas who were busking in Pioneer Square.
Willie Nelson’s son Lukas Nelson & The Promise of The Real were up next on the main stage performing a high energy set and Lukas sounding quite a bit like his dad.
Punk rockers Hot Snakes performed on the KEXP stage. Guitarist John Reis had three bottles of Corona set up near his mic stand and moments before their set began Reis took two of the bottles walked on to the sub in front of the stage and proceeded to shake them and spray beer on the photographers that had assembled in the middle of the stage. Thankfully I was off to the side. While you can argue “that’s rock and roll”, it’s also not fun having to clean beer off thousands of dollars worth of camera equipment.
After taking photos of Hot Snakes I ran over to the two AXIS venues to see two very different artists. From folk artist Maiah Wynne & Her Sleepless Knights from Portland to grunge pop band Great Grandpa. As someone attending the festival for the first time and first time experiencing Seattle’s music scene, it was fun sampling so many artists I’d probably would never have known about otherwise.
After venturing to Occidental Park for some of Whitey Lyman‘s set and the first group to perform Canada House it was time for one of my favourite new discoveries. Before the festival, I YouTubed a lot of artists to figure out who to cover and came across Elise Trouw‘s live mashup video of Foo Fighter’s ‘Everlong’ and Billy Caldwell’s ‘What You Won’t Do for Love’. The video shows here singing, playing guitar, bass, keyboard and drums by herself all in one take. On top of that, she’s just 19 years old. I was very interested in how her live looping would translate live and in person and was thoroughly impressed.
Saturday’s headliner was recently reunited punk band Jawbreaker. Because I didn’t want to miss Elise Trouw and Vancouver’s Little Destroyer, I didn’t catch Jawbreaker until halfway through their set.
Two bands that performed at The Central Saloon Saturday night featured bands with Seattle Grunge era legends. Though you’d be forgiven if you didn’t know they were in the bands that were performing. Seattle’s MKB Ultra features guitarist/producer Jack Endino. Endino produced Soundgarden’s ‘Screaming Life’ and Nirvana’s ‘Bleach’ album. Then there was Giants in The Trees, a band that features Nirvana bassist Krist Novoselic on bass and accordion. At one point I was taking photos of Krist and he noticed was I was doing and stared directly at my lens. Made my night having a founder of a legendary band posing just for me.
Sunday began with rain. Rain in Seattle? That’s unheard of! (*sarcasm). But the rain eventually stopped as the day progressed. Daniel Pak brought some chill reggae vibes that helped people forget about the dampness and the good vibes continued with soul band The True Loves.
After taking some photos of Memphis Tennessee’s Valarie June, I ran over to the Starbucks stage to catch some of The Brodcast‘s set and to the Central Saloon for Red Ribbon.
Across the street from The Sound Lot Ramonda Hammer performed at Elysian Fields. Ramonda Hammer was one of my favourite new discoveries of the weekend and I wish I could have stayed for their full set, but I had to run to catch the tail end of Snotty Nose Rez Kids and one song of dreamcatchr then get in photographer line for The Flaming Lips.
The Flaming Lips are always an experience to behold. Wayne Coyne was in a pirate outfit with an eye patch. There was confetti, giant balloons, a large inflatable robot, Coyne rode a unicorn in the crowd and also rolled on the crowd in the Flaming Lips signature hamster bubble. You don’t have to know The Flaming Lips’ music to enjoy the spectacle that is one of their shows. Coyne even held up giant balloon letters that said “F**K YEAH SEATTLE”.
As much as would have liked to stay for all of the set, I wanted to cover as many bands as I could, so I left early to try to see The Living Hour at the Canada House stage, but arrived just as the last song was ending. I could’ve ran back to catch more of The Flaming Lips but I stayed put to make sure I wouldn’t miss Vernon’s daysormay. From there it was off to see Murder City Devils at the AXIS 1 stage.
Another new discovery I was impressed with was Los Angeles’ Lo Moon. Looking into them further after the festival I discovered their debut record was produced by Chris Walla (formerly of Death Cab for Cutie).
Closing out my Upstream experience was Vancouver’s Yukon Blonde.
Coming as a person very used to multi-venue festivals like Rifflandia, Upstream was a very familiar experience. You’re probably not going to see mega-headliners anytime soon at the festival and your mainstream concert goer may be turned off by that. But this festival isn’t supposed to be a Coachella or even a Bumbershoot. The main point of Upstream is to showcase mostly up-and-coming artists from around the region. I went knowing very little of the artists and left discovering a few gems I’d love to know more about and see come up to Canada.
The summit portion of the festival is super informative and a great opportunity to network with and learn from experts in the music industry and should not be missed. I wish I could have attended all the sessions on the schedule.
The Sound Lot had a decent layout with two side-by-side stages, but I was surprised there were 15 minutes breaks between sets even though the stages alternated. More people might stay within the main venue if the music on the next stage started right away.
The price for a bottled water at $5 was too much. Converting that $5 to Canadian dollars, it makes that bottle of Dasani water close to $7. I can understand the “festival pricing” markup for a bottle of Coke, but keep water prices lower or have free tap water filling stations on site. Speaking of drinks, I don’t know what Seattle’s liquor bylaws are, but the experience in The Sound Lot would be so much better if it had an open licence. So many festivals now allow you to consume alcohol throughout a venue, having people stuck in a fenced off beverage garden just to drink a beer feels so behind the times. One other thing I found a bit odd on the final day of the festival was that a few of the food vendors at The Sound Lot were strangely absent on Sunday.
With all that said, I thoroughly enjoyed my time exploring the music at Upstream Music Fest + Summit and Seattle’s music scene.",en,unknown
"I always knew that The Rock would be destined for great things as an action star. Funny too, since for a long while in his acting career, he didn't do lots of action. I get it why, I know lots of people fear being type cast or adopting a certain persona that you can't get out of. The problem is that he went so far in the other direction that he became a joke. Lots of the kiddy stuff he did wasn't funny nor was it particularly good, and I am glad that he finally returned where he belonged, in the action movie arena. I have enjoyed The Rock's turn in ""The Fast and Furious"" franchise. I have really enjoyed his presents in a lot of the other action oriented stuff he has been doing. Even though it's not an action show, The Rock is really good on HBO's ""Ballers,"" a show everyone should check out.
Just because it feels like The Rock is back home doesn't mean everything he is going to do is going to be great. I am a little hesitant for when ""Rampage"" gets released. What looks like a fairly typical monster movie is actually based on a video game. A video game that my brother use to play frequently on our Nintendo 64. I also had a game boy version of the game too. The movie being set in Chicago is no random movie setting. The first place you destroyed in the video game were cities in Illinois and you do attack Chicago. One of the first cities you destroy was Peoria, and since we are from Peoria, we made a big deal about that. The game was simple, you chose a monster, between a giant gorilla, a giant wolf or a giant lizard and you destroyed cities. That was basically it, so that didn't leave lots of room for crafting a story.
The video game is getting adapted into a movie and it seems like they are going the most generic way possible in explaining how three animals became huge monsters. I suppose I would have thought this was cool back when I loved playing the game. But after many recent years of CGI things destroying cities, this just looks like more of the same.",en,books
"Praise is in your mouth – invite God in!
The Lord is Good and worthy of our Praise!
Be Glad in the Lord, and Rejoice!
Shout for Joy, and Dance!
Yadah (ya-dah) means to willfully throw your hands up to praise with power.
Todah (to-da’), we lift our hands, as a sacrificial offering for future things that are unseen.
Halal (ha-lal) means to celebrate, or act clamorously foolish in your praise.
Tehillah (teh-hil-la’), we sing a new song unto the Lord – in the gift of tongues as well.
Ruwa (ru-ah) means to give your best shout, like an alarming trumpet – Glory!
Alaz (al-az) means “to rejoice, to exult, to jump for joy”.
Karar (Ka –rar’) means “to dance and whirl about”.
Machowl (ma’khole’) means “a round dance, like whirling particles, as sand)”.
Mechowlah (mek-o-la’) means “a dance:-company dances” with more than one person.
Pazaz (pa-zaz) means “to leap, to spring, to bound, be agile – made strong, be supple as if separating the limbs, or flee as a gazelle.
These words will help you express your praise. Do you know that praise is a powerful weapon, and can shape your destiny?
What have you been saying about yourself and your current situation? Have you been blessing or cursing? God has set before you this day the power of praise – the blessing, or the power of fear – the cursing. Choose today!
You spend too much time worrying, complaining, and living in fear; where satan would love for you to stay in that state, but God made available for all to choose life (Deuteronomy 30:19)! It’s your decision, and no one can make that decision for you. So what are you choosing today? Life of praise, I hope!
I have a great story that you can find in the book called “Praise Avenue” by Don Gossett. If you are here for the first time. I have available for you the first chapter in this book if you would like to read it, click here. Mr. Gossett tells of a couple named Mr. & Mrs. Perry Cowger, and how they found that praise is the key to everything.
“Mr.& Mrs. Perry Cowger of Burnaby, British Columbia, were on a holiday north of Fort St. John, B.C.
While traveling many miles from where anyone lived, they stopped beside a river for a picnic. When they were ready to continue their journey, they could not find their car keys. In desperation, they searched all over the car and around the area where they had had their picnic. But their search was fruitless.
Brother and Sister Cowger lifted their hands and voices and praised the Lord right out there in their place of isolation, many miles from anyone and anywhere.
And that’s Praise. Praise is in your mouth – your tongue!
The tongue is to speak forth a prophecy on a daily basis. It will speak life or death. The blessing and the cursing!
If you do not know what to say, don’t say anything until you start speaking the Word of God into your life (Proverbs 15:4). The tongue is to express the glory and the power of God. He has given this weapon to you for self-defense. That’s why I said to you before that “Praise is a Weapon, Use it”!
God said to you, “speak… and say… in faith… according to the Word.” You are to speak out in faith what you want to come to pass, just like Him. “Light be!” and light was (Genesis 1:3). Amen.
These are only a few of the scriptures available for study. As you can see, the tongue plays an important part in your destiny. Yesterday I asked you to check your motive before praising and worshipping the Lord. Now, I’m asking you to keep your tongue, and praise!
You mouth determines your success or failure in life. What are you going to choose? You are the only one that can be the pilot of your life; which direction will you take?
Praise is the key to the presence of God. It is essential to the knowledge and purpose of His will, but you must speak life! Open up your mouth and say God’s will for your life.
Praise is in your mouth – invite Him in!
Please listen and do what God is calling for you to do – PRAISE HIM!
Ooh Glory to His Name!
Give me a HOLLA, if you would like to send me your praise report. I would love to read it, or leave a comment here. Thanks!",en,web
"Citation: ZHANG JIPING (2009-06-09). Investigation of the roles of two Rac1 effectors phosphatidylinositol-5 kinase 1a and p21-activated kinase 1 in insulin-secreting cells. ScholarBank@NUS Repository.
Abstract: Rac1 has been proved to participate in glucose- and cAMP-induced insulin secretion through regulation of actin cytoskeleton previously. In my study, the knockdown of PIP5K-I alpha and PAK1, two critical downstream effectors of Rac1, was achieved by using RNA interference technique in INS-1 cells. PIP5K-I alpha knockdown disrupted F-actin structure and caused changes in glucose metabolism, membrane potential, intracellular Ca 2+ concentration and PIP2 distribution. The incremental insulin release over basal stimulated by high glucose and forskolin was inhibited in PIP5K-I alpha knockdown cells, suggesting a role of PIP5K-I alpha in both the proximal and distal steps of signaling cascades in insulin secretion. On the other hand, PAK1 knockdown had no effect on either insulin secretion or actin cytoskeleton, but rescued prolonged exposure to high glucose induced cell death and blocked activation of caspase-3 partially. P38 MAPK was activated downstream of PAK1 upon glucotoxicity and may, at least in part, mediate the pro-apoptotic role of PAK1. The latter part suggests that PAK1 is involved in control of beta-cell death and glucotoxicity.",en,academic
"Kentucky lawmakers are leading the fight to federally legalize hemp, which was once a big cash crop for the Bluegrass State.
Kentucky is currently the leading industrial hemp-producing state in the United States, taking advantage of Section 7606 in the 2014 Farm Bill that allows the growing of the crop for research and pilot projects. At one time, hemp was a big cash crop for Kentucky, where farmers produced 40,000 tons in 1850. Now the Bluegrass State is leading the effort to legalize the versatile crop, as multiple Kentucky lawmakers have sponsored a piece of federal legislation that will end hemp prohibition nationwide — the Industrial Hemp Farming Act of 2017.
Hemp has a long history in America, but has been prohibited since 1970 when the federal government blanket-banned all forms of cannabis. The crop contains an average of less than 1 percent tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the psychoactive compound of cannabis, making it impossible for the plant to elicit a high. Instead, hemp has more than 25,000 product applications, including textiles, paper, food, body care supplies, and nutritional supplements. One of its primary compounds, cannabidiol (CBD), has shown in over 23,000 studies to interact with the body’s natural systems.
The nation’s hemp market is estimated to be worth $688 million. Because commercial hemp cultivation remains illegal, the crop must be imported, hindering economic potential for domestic farmers.
The Industrial Hemp Farming Act of 2017 (H.R. 3530), sponsored by a bipartisan group of lawmakers, including Kentucky’s Massie and Rep. James Comer, calls for treating hemp like corn, wheat, and other traditional farm crops. It would remove all federal restrictions and prohibitions that inhibit commercial hemp cultivation.
Two bills that would have legalized hemp federally were introduced in 2015, but both died in committee.
Comer was Kentucky’s Commissioner of Agriculture in 2013, giving him the position of leverage he needed to insert the industrial hemp amendment in the 2014 Farm Bill that allows states to pass laws permitting production for research and pilot purposes. Kentucky is one of over 30 states that have done so. Farmers planted 33 acres that first year, and every year the state’s program has multiplied. Kentucky farmers grew 4,500 acres in 2016 and are slated to cultivate 12,000 acres this year.
An official from Kentucky’s Governor’s Office of Agricultural Policy has said he believes that Kentucky’s hemp market has strong commercial potential, and hopes it will eventually help compensate for the economic hit farmers have taken with the downfall of the tobacco industry.

"What a day, our God is here and His light is breaking into the darkness. This morning we had the privilege of working with a Christian group who run a day care centre looking after young children. We ran a kid’s club for the kids and everyone involved had a blast. Tonight, we worked alongside an organisation called Hard Places. These young guys and girls go out every evening to work with the kids along the riverside, a sort of mobile Kids club. What a pleasure to help them share the love of Jesus even in the hard places. I have been blown away by the passion and drive that every local Cambodian who follows Jesus has. They have experienced His love and each one that I have met is on fire to see the lives of people transformed and restored in Jesus’ name.
God is on the move in Cambodia so keep praying for these beautiful, humble people. They are definitely teaching me as I get the pleasure of walking with them at this time.",en,books

"I was reminded of something very important while dining at Cru. When you give the chef freedom to fly you will visit many places you never expected, some good, some great and some not worth visiting again. In our own kitchen we change the menu daily though our freedom is influenced or corralled--depends whom you talk to--by the guests who visit with us. We are definitely exploring food though it still must remain grounded. I have difficulty with that at times, though Aki is able to help filter and edit my adventurous side.
The menu at Cru reads well with the ingredients coming from near and far though with distinct leanings toward Japan in the selections and seasonings of the crudo, and more firmly towards Italy with the homemade pastas. Though there is more to offer than what you see on the menu. Ask for the kitchen to cook for you. Be willing and open to taste and see what the chef, Shea Gallante, and his team has to offer. We arrived at dinner with a couple of tastes for the kitchen as well. Last year we ran into Shea in Aspen and gave him some vanilla salt. We felt it only fitting to bring some chocolate salt this time around. We also brought a bottle of tequila vinegar, with his affinity for raw fish we felt the vinegar would be a fun ingredient to work with.
After we were seated and had perused the menu we were given the opportunity to have the kitchen cook for us. Just say yes. If the opportunity arises just nod, explain any allergies or food dislikes and perhaps a culinary spark from the menu at hand and let the kitchen cook. We did and that was key to a wonderful evening. Oh, and they also offered to pair wines with appropriate courses. That meant we had absolutely nothing to do but eat, drink and enjoy an evening with Reiko.
The first course, in this case bite, came after an array of canapés. I do not have a written menu in hand and even if I did, not much that we were served came from the printed menu. I am thus recreating the meal from memory so there may be a few slips, though as can be shown from my recall that the menu was memorable.
The dishes were fun and exciting. The only real mis-steps came during dessert. They just did not mesh with the rest of the menu. Something is out of sync and that is unfortunate for if the desserts could become part of the whole Cru would be truly spectacular. Sure there were a few other small stumbles in the menu, in spite of these we can honestly say that as an overall experience Cru was well worth the journey. We can add Cru to the list of places that we'd return to and that list is not a long one this year.",en,books
"Designing the intricacies of any home will often Buckeye, look like a frightening and overwhelming task to achieve. People become discouraged when they think of renovating the landscape with their home, yet if you know the essentials of the items you're doing, it isn't that tough to complete. Look through this informative article and discover what you can find out about landscaping your house.
When organising a landscaping project for your house, be sure that you put your design in writing first. This can help you visualize your concept and ensure that your project will probably work. This is going to help make certain you tend not to waste your time and effort and your money with a misguided plan.
Think about water requirements. Living inside an area that doesn't get plenty of rain, use plants that don't require a great deal of water. Grass needs more water than any other kind of plant, so replace your lawn with wood chips, gravel, or a type of ground cover that is certainly suitable for high drought areas.
Install drip-irrigation as a good way to maintain your plants watered. These highly-efficient systems are easily installed with the layman, and give a continuous drip water. The water is more efficient but it's a drip instead of a stream, which happens to be what's useful for hoses and sprinklers.
Before you begin your landscaping work, be sure you plan your goals and assess your financial allowance. This may make certain you possess a solid plan in place so that you tend not to use up all your materials before the job is carried out. It is going to give you a better thought of your design needs.
Landscape based on how much time you are able to commit. While an elaborate landscape might look really good in writing, do not forget that it requires constant upkeep. When making a garden think of your available time, your wellbeing, as well as your budget. Usually take around the responsibilities of a garden you could easily handle.
Before purchasing or planting a particular plant, make sure that you know its expected height and its growth rate. You could decide not to bother with this cute little shrub if you realise out how fast it can become an overgrown monster. Fast-growing plants may require more pruning and maintenance than you bargained for, so research your options prior to shop.
If you reside in a part of the country that may be vulnerable to wildfires, choose landscaping projects accordingly. By way of example, trees should be planted a minimum of 100 feet apart. Additionally, large trees should not be planted below 100 feet from the house or any other building structure (garden, shed, workshop, etc.).
Prepare what time of the year you are going to purchase your supplies to save money. For example, lumber fails to cost the maximum amount of during the cold months mainly because it does during the summer. You can also get better deals on trees, soil and perennials later in the season if not as so many people are buying them.
You need to know of the level of soil you're working together with when making your landscape. Some plants don't grow well in many soil. If your soil inhibits your creativity, you are able to change it or create separate bedding areas composed of wood chips or mulch.
Before you begin a landscaping project investigate what it might do in order to your home tax bill. There are many of projects that may greatly increase the need for your house, that can contributes to yearly payments via taxes in your landscaped yard. Be certain these expenses are something you are prepared to incur before you begin.
Compile materials with time. Landscaping might be expensive. Most people just don't have enough money to buy the types of materials they require all at once. Instead of giving up on landscaping, buy your materials gradually. Buy materials only when you can afford them, and be on the lookout once and for all deals.
Water features included in a landscape project will evoke a sense of tranquility. A lot of people think about ponds with regards to watering features. However, you should not overlook birdbaths and water fountains when planning water features. These can be inexpensively and easily placed right into a landscape area with no digging.
Carefully determine the quantities of material you will want. It may be quite simple to under or overestimate the amount of virtually any material you will have to get the job done. Before you get started, check you math. Get a second kind of eyes or perhaps a professional to take a look at the materials list.

"It isn’t easy dealing with a breakup. An avalanche of hurt, distress and sadness comes crashing down on you, often when you least expect it. Instead of looking to friends and family for support, getting away from it all can make a huge difference. Sometimes all you need is a fresh take on things, some breathing space and a wider perspective. Know what can give you all three, and more? Some solo travel. In fact, it’s just what the doctor ordered.
We give you six reasons why going on a solo trip right now is the best thing you could do for your emotional, mental and physical health.
A relationship that didn’t work out can damage your self-worth to the point where you start to question why you deserve the best. To reframe that question and help yourself realize that you do indeed deserve nothing less than the best, take a trip outside your comfort zone, literally and figuratively. Travel has a marvelous way of expanding your horizons while reminding you of how cool you really are. Even the very act of planning a holiday can boost your self-esteem, while exploring a new place on your own and having to be resourceful on the go does wonders for how you view yourself.
Being part of a couple creates the illusion that you are just half a person, after a split. You need to remember that you are a whole individual with unique needs and dreams that need to be nurtured. Traveling to a foreign land or even just another city you’ve never visited before can help you rediscover those needs and dreams. Independence is exhilarating, if you use this time to review the past. In this fresh setting, you can plan the future too, without old fears inhibiting you.
Let go of the old, and bring in the new. Traveling to an unfamiliar place will force you to forge new connections. Don’t be scared, it’s an adventure waiting to happen. Open up and pay attention to fellow travelers, friendly locals, even the employees who make your travel, stay and dining experiences enjoyable. While you don’t have to be best buds right off the bat, do strike up a conversation and listen to their stories. Meeting new people will remind you of how you are certainly not alone, and that there are folks with similar interests everywhere.
Being wrapped up in your hurt can dull your senses, and make you see negativity everywhere. By traveling, you open yourself up to the possibility of seeing things with new eyes. Not only will you have a newfound appreciation for the everyday, you will also be able to appreciate the exotic. There’s nothing like being away from your usual surroundings to cherish them even more when you get back.
Don’t fall into the trap of being on holiday, while being mentally stuck with your everyday routine. We recommend switching off: stay away from social media, put your phone on airplane mode once you’ve let your family and friends know you’re safe, and do not contact your ex. Traveling means you don’t have to run the risk of hanging out in familiar places that will bring back painful memories, or meet friends whose sympathy will rankle you. Keep it that way. What’s even better is there’s absolutely no chance of going on the rebound with a friend, or mistakenly confiding in a ‘frenemy’ in a moment of weakness.
The biggest bonus of traveling solo is that it will impress upon you the joys of being single. It doesn’t matter how long you’ve been in a relationship, you need to remember what it was like to be generously ‘selfish’. On your travels, you will slowly segue into being alone and loving it. We don’t mean you have to climb a mountain or sail into the ocean; there’s plenty of places to be alone in the middle of a crowd such as airplanes, airports, restaurants, all great locations to practice enjoying your own wonderful company.
A breakup isn’t something we look forward to, but if it does happen, seek solace in travel.

"Can a Gluten-Free Diet Improve Your Health?
Could cutting gluten from your diet improve your health, help you lose weight and feel better?
If you have a gluten sensitivity, like close to 10% of the population, yes!
With all of the gluten-free products sprouting up on the market and talk of gluten intolerance these days I thought it’d be useful to shed a bit of light(?) on this hot health topic.
Gluten is a protein compound found in many cereals such as wheat, barley, rye, oat *, kamut, spelt and triticale. Gluten, as its name suggests, is responsible for the elasticity and viscosity of the flour paste that makes bread. One then finds gluten in many foods such as breads, pastries, pasta, but it is also used by the food industry as a binder in some sauces, yogurt, processed meals, etc. This being said, now that people are eating more processed foods they are also consuming more gluten.
What is so bad about gluten? Nothing if you are not intolerant or allergic.
Two categories of people are recommended to cut gluten from their diets; people who have celiac disease (also known as a gluten allergy) and those who are gluten intolerant (gluten sensitivity).
Wheat is one of the eight most allergenic foods and celiac disease is said to affect 1% of the population. Non-celiac gluten sensitivity on the other hand affects 5 to 10 % of the population. Both of which are highly underdiagnosed, many people affected live with symptoms for years before discovering it to be the cause of their health problems.
Many people who have no gluten allergy or intolerance have also benefited from increased wellbeing and health due to the fact that avoiding gluten means avoiding most junk foods and processed foods. You must therefore eat more homemade whole foods which is always a good thing.
Gluten intolerance, because its symptoms are not so severe (may include flatulence, abdominal pain, abdominal distension and diarrhea) may be harder to diagnose.
Celiac disease is an autoimmune disease that affects the sides of the intestinal wall. Symptoms are much more severe, they may include skin rash, wheezing, lip swelling, abdominal pain and diarrhea.
According to certain theories people affected with intolerance may develop other inflammatory diseases as a repercussion of long term gluten consumption, such as type 2 diabetes, fibromyalgia, arthritis, fertility problems… Also, because an allergy or intolerance to gluten affects your intestinal wall it means that your nutrient absorption (which occurs in the intestines) is compromised. This can lead to osteoporosis due to malabsorption of calcium, iron deficient anemia, and poor absorption of other important vitamins and minerals essential for proper health.
Why the sudden upsurge of gluten sensitivity?
Although some previously believed that gluten sensitivity and celiac disease are more common nowadays due to increased detection and awareness, it has recently been proven that 50 years ago these were much less common.
Why the sudden upsurge of gluten sensitivity? Pure wheat flour has only been part of the western diet for the last 200 years; it was previously combined and milled with other grains and seeds. With the mass cultivation of wheat, it is now much more economical to make breads consisting of only refined wheat.
Modern wheat is very different to what it once was as a result of hybridization of the grain, it now contains significantly higher amounts of gluten. The current high gluten containing diet is not what our ancestors were eating therefore making it harder for our bodies to digest and recognize.

"Bean imports will be temporarily suspended starting from September 15, according to an official statement from the Ministry of Commerce in the second week of September.
At a pulse and bean coordination team meeting during the first week of September, bean merchants requested the ministry to stop bean imports.
After the Ministry checked the situation, it was found that imported bean supplies exceeded demand. Consequently, the decision to temporarily suspend bean imports to stabilise the local market was made.
Import license applications submitted before September 15 will be allowed only if a Bill of Lading (BL) can be submitted. Renewal of previous bean import licenses were also suspended from September 8.
The move allows excessive stocks of pigeon peas, mung beans and black beans in Myanmar resulting from the recent import restrictions by India to be absorbed by the local market as substitutes for the imported beans, Myanmar Pulses, Beans and Sesame Seeds Entrepreneurs Association secretary U Min Ko Oo told the Myanmar Times.
Myanmar imports a small amount of beans, which includes green peas from Canada, Australia and Ukraine for use in vermicelli mills, because these are cheaper than the beans it imports.
While a tonne of pigeon peas for the export market costs about US$500 to US$600 a tonne, the same quantity of imported green peas cost only about US$300.
However, as the price of pigeon peas has fallen to around US$300 a tonne, pigeon peas can now used as a substitute for imported green peas and raise demand.
Green peas, which are mainly used in place of chick peas for making vermicelli, have been imported for 4 years and last year, over 100,000 tonnes were imported. If pigeon peas can be substituted, its demand will be increased.
""If beans import is suspended, there will be a local market for substitute beans."" U Min Ko Oo said.
The Ministry of Commerce will review the import of beans depending on domestic market requirements.",en,web

We exist to equip African men and women with a sustainable income, generated through the sale of their products.
It's officially summer here at Market Colors and with that comes the blessing of four new interns, bringing our total to six! With our team having doubled in just a week it's amazing to see how much we are able to accomplish. Each of them is so talented and bring unique skills to the table which we are so thankful for. You've already met Beverly and Grace, who started in January, and today we'd like to introduce Aubrey and Kaylee.
Aubrey is from Orlando and is pursuing her Bachelors degree at the University of Central Florida. She is studying Interpersonal and Organizational Communication, the study of relationships, and minoring in Leadership Studies. She is passionate about the Lord and the people He has given her to love and serve. Her desire is to spend her professional career in community outreach and build relationships with all she meets. More specifically, the Lord has put a call on her heart to work with the underprivileged, homeless, and disabled. Aubrey has traveled to India to evangelize and work with the homeless, individuals with special needs, and those with leprosy. She carries the same passion and vision as Market Colors, to reach out and reveal the love of Christ.
Aubrey heard about Market Colors through her close friend, Lizzie Wirgau, (our CEO) and now holds the position of Event Planning Intern. In her spare time, she loves to create and enjoy music, spend intentional time with friends, and eat good food. She is very involved in her church's worship program and volunteers with Younglife ministry.
Kaylee is an Orlando native and currently in her final year at UCF, studying Nonprofit Management and African Studies. She immediately connected with the mission of Market Colors because of ""the amazing things we're doing in Africa"". Kaylee has served in Kenya for the past three summers and has fallen in love with all of its beauty. She will be getting married later this year and is excited to be moving to Kenya with her sweetheart next year. She'll continue working to promote more opportunities for young people.
Kaylee loves photography, interesting patterns and bright colors, reading about social justice and international development, the outdoors, and traveling. She is obsessed with avocados. Besides interning with Market Colors as the Marketing and Outreach Intern, Kaylee also works at Starbucks and loves all things coffee and tea. This summer, Kaylee will be managing our Home Parties, working with the Street Team, and connecting with churches and other organizations.
Check back with us next week to read more about Kaylee's experience in Kenya and to meet our other two new interns, Jessica and Allee!",en,web

"Papercrafters in the United States create cards in relatively standard sizes. Typical dimensions of handmade greeting cards stem from standard paper sizes resulting in the most common sizes of cards: 4 1/4 inches high by 5 1/2 inches wide and 3 3/4 inches high by 8 1/2 inches wide. These rectangular card sizes fit in standard envelopes within the constraints of a ""First-Class Mail Letter"" postal rate as defined by the USPS. A ""Letter"" size ranges between a minimum size of 3 1/2 inches high by 5 inches long to a maximum size of 6 1/8 inches high by 11 1/2 inches long. A square card made from 12-by-12 piece of scrapbook paper results in a card othat is 6-inches square. The use of square envelopes invokes the post office requirement of additional postage.
The use of beads or eyelets as embellishments increases the final envelope thickness. Shipping handmade cards with beads or eyelets often warrants the use of additional padding material in the envelope to protect the embellishments from the automatic sorting machines. The greater thickness of padding can increase the postage amount for an embellished card. The USPS requires a higher postal rate for a ""First-Class Mail Large Envelope"" if the thickness ranges from over 1/4 inch to 3/4 inch.
The USPS allows the ""Letter"" postal rate for cards weighing up to 3.5 oz. Unless the card has particularly large beads or eyelets as embellishments, rarely does it exceed the weight limit. Cards heavier than 3.5 oz. fall into the higher ""Large Envelope"" postal rate.
The safest approach to sending a thicker or bumpier card with beads or eyelets may be hand canceling a stamp in person at the post office. Although the sender must wait in a line at the post office to accomplish this extra step, the benefits outweigh the extra hassle. The sender eliminates the uncertainty of the card surviving the postal sorting machines. The USPS verifies total postage amount to ensure prompt delivery. Finally, hand canceling provides a personalized touch for that handmade card with beads or eyelets.
The USPS provides an online postal calculator to give up-to-date postal rates for all the variables of shipping handmade cards, which may be odd weights, dimensions and thicknesses. The postal calculator lends the advantage of prompting the user for unexpected postal requirements or costs for additional specialized services.",en,reference

"The largest current infrastructure project in the state of New York. LaGuardia Airport. LGA in aviation terms.
A seven-year project that completely overhauls highways, terminals, and gates.
For any LGA traveler, this is a welcome transformation. The airport boasts some of the worst reviews in the country.
Last Friday afternoon I arrived at LaGuardia. It was my first visit to the airport in a year. It was a wonderful surprise to exit the jetway and spill into a new Terminal B concourse. Open space, high ceilings, new restaurants and retail. An amazing transformation. I should note, a partial transformation. The work isn’t done, and frankly, once you exit a hallway out of Terminal B, you are quickly escorted back to the chaos that is LaGuardia.
Less than 24 hours later and I was back. I sipped a cup of morning brew from a brand-new coffee shop. And as I sipped, I sat at a new high-top table with cool seats and a plug for my phone. The vibe was tangible and exciting.
An hour later I was on my Southwest flight bound for Denver. Home. We pushed back from the gate within a few minutes of scheduled departure time. Once disconnected from the Tug that propelled us away from the gate, engines revved, and we began to move. But only for a short distance.
Then we sat. And we sat.
This announcement provoked an investigation for me. LaGuardia was constructed in 1939 for $23 million. At the time it was designed with four runways. Over the decades that followed, increased airplane velocity and capacity has forced the airport to consolidate into two runways. Both are a constraining 7,000-foot length.
Two runways. 16 airplanes in line in front of us.
But wait, the $6 Billion LaGuardia will still only have two 7,000-foot runways. Two.
The mission of an airport is to get airplanes up and down safely and on time. A perfectly crafted latte does not define a successful airport. Comfortable lounge chairs and charging stations are a perk, not a purpose.
And then reality. Then a conviction. I fear that in many ways I am LaGuardia Airport. Focused on comfort and convenience but distracted from my mission. A mission that Jesus defines as being “my witnesses” (Acts 1:8).
The coffee is great… but the planes sit.
$6 Billion – and the same old airport. The same delays. The same missed connections. The same dicey landings in bad (and sometimes good) weather. The airport will be able to accurately claim new, more modern comfort for the misery, but not a new airport.
Not just a new souvenir shop, the latest in sushi, or a bold new pour over coffee… but a NEW CREATION. The old has gone. The new is come.
Am I settling? Are you?",en,books
"Multicriteria Decision Aid/Making (MCDA/M) has been among the most rapidly growing areas of Operation Research for the last thirty years, both from the point of view of theoretical developments and of practical applications. This evolution is explained by the fact that scientists and practitioners have realized that most real world decision-making problems inevitably require the presence of multiple points of view (criteria), conflicting in nature, in order to achieve a correct formulation which corresponds better to the real world. Problem resolution is not linked anymore to an optimal solution but to several criterion satisfactory solutions to be negotiated through compromises and trade-offs.
Several models and algorithms have been proposed by researchers on both sides of the Atlantic, as an approach to various types of multicriteria problems. In North America, the multi-attribute approach based on utility theory has been developed which postulate a single aggregation criterion. In Europe, the non compensatory outranking approach has been developed. Simultaneously, the development of computer technology, particularly in microcomputers, has made possible the implementation and extension of multiple criteria methods, which has resulted in increasingly widespread practical applications in private and public organizations, in industry and commerce, in planning and management, in banking and agriculture, in regional and environmental planning, etc.
With the purpose of promoting the diffusion of the potentialities of multicriteria models as valuable supporting instruments in decision-making, a group of well known North American and European scientists decided to promote, gradually, the International Summer School on MCDA/M: Methods, Applications and Software.
Since 1983, the Summer School on MCDA/M is a joint event of the International Society on Multiple Criteria Decision Making and the EURO Working Group on Multicriteria Decision Aiding.

Trade unions in local government have accepted a “deal” on pensions not very different from what we went on strike against on 30 November.

"While the odds in favor of the anticipated third straight Cleveland/Golden State final are at least 15 to 1, I will inform you that 13th overall, Ottawa (Senators) would have the home advantage vs 16th overall, Nashville (Predators), should they meet in the 2017 Stanley Cup finals.
There is a long way to go, but with both “Ott” and “Nash” up (2-1) in their respective semis, the unlikely scenario where whom would have “home” between the two teams becoming relevant, has manifested as a point of great interest, but not fact.
If “Nash” wins tonight vs Anaheim, likely, they will eventually become the first team since the ’08 Pittsburgh Penguins (the Pens are Ottawa’s current semis opponent) to advance to the Cup finals sans a home loss.
I could cite a most serious situation involving his wife or lightheartedly recall a pitcher with the same name, but alas suffice to say Craig Anderson, pictured above, has been brilliant in goal vs the defending champion, (do not dare count them out), Penguins, allowing but 3 goals in 3 games, only two at all meaningful.

Ui parts can receive that signal and display an appropriate message box.
Start e.g. kate and open the settings dialog or spell check a document (via the Tools -> Spelling -> spelling menu), an error message about the unavailable dictionary should be displayed.
OK. I didn't know the core/ui differentiation, I'll adjust the patch and see if I can come up with a better solution without having core lib depend on widgets.
Perhaps should Loader::createSpeller return some ""Error-Helper-Dictionary"" instead of a nullptr, so that Sonnet::defaultLanguage may give something like ""ERROR-de_AT_ost"" instead of e.g ""de_AT_ost"".
Accordingly should Sonnet::preferredDictionaries filled with data like ""ERROR-de_AT_ost""/""ERROR-Deutsch (Östereich something)""
Take a look at D18125, why I think that may helpful. In the new button should then the hint possible to be shown ""ERROR-foo"".
Not investigated if all of these is needed or possible.
The user will open the sonnet config dialog and see that the dictionary he wants is already selected (e.g. the dictionary files have just been renamed, but it's the same dictionary); that is confusing, as can be gleaned from the linked bug report.

"Week 3 Premier League action hits this weekend following the exciting first two weeks of matches. The unfortunate part is that this will be followed by first annoying international break. The only hope that I have for these matches is that nobody on my FPL teams returns injured.
After two full weeks of matches there is still very little to go on. There are several surprises in the Premier League table with Huddersfield, West Brom, and Watford holding down positions 2-4. This will almost certainly be a short lived top four, but it is always interesting to see teams expecting to finish near the bottom starting out by playing above their expectations.
I still plan to captain Romelu Lukaku in Manchester United’s home match versus Leicester City. Leicester has already allowed 4 goals to start this season and Lukaku has scored 3, which looks like a favorable matchup. The bigger issue up front is what to do with Harry Kane. If ever there was a time for Kane to finally score in August in the Premier League, it is certainly at home to Burnley. Kane did look better in last week’s match against Chelsea, with 2 chances created and 3 shots on target. I’d expect him to do more against Burnley who have allowed 3 goals so far.
If you are looking for attacking options, then Liverpool is probably your best bet for midfield and an additional forward, although, you will have to choose between Lukaku (11.7) and Kane (12.5) if you want a Liverpool forward like Firmino (8.5).
At this early point in the season, I’m still sticking with my relatively cheap defenders. I have yet to pick him up, but have considered going in for West Brom’s Ahmed Hegazi who is at just 4.5, but leading the scoring for all defenders with a massive 23 points. His selection percentage is certainly increasing and he has jumped to second most owned defender with 20.2% ownership behind David Luiz at 25.7%.
If you are looking for more of a differential, I would recommend Burnley’s Stephen Ward. He is just 4.5 and has a 4.3% ownership while picking up a total of 9 points despite Burnley giving up 3 goals already. Even in their 0-1 loss to West Brom he managed to pick up 2 points. Burnley aren’t going to win a lot of games, but he looks like a player that could pick up some points this season and is a 4.5 defender.
That wraps up my week 3 Premier League predictions along with week 3 FPL tips. Hopefully your FPL season has kicked off well and you’re enjoying yourself. Good luck and have fun!",en,web
"@Type44 – Not criticizing in any way, just want to say that I think that what sludgo has done, as most good writers do, is put enough info in to let you be “at” the scene, but leave enough out so that you can be “in” the scene. If one knows every piece of what happened/s, then one may not feel the pull, may not be able to put their own feelings into it, and lose some of the connectivity.
Again, not implying any negativity, but, you might be able to use this story as a way to visit/revisit a/some memory of yours and wonder, just as an exercise, what if.
No doubt a nice car and yes probably a great drive, but I have never understood the value of a PCA on a car with this many mods an changes. But, I guess it means something to somebody.
The memories of what was, and the dreams of what could/should have been are often better, more comfortable than what would most likely have been. No regrets for the moments, life, living, after what was “it, the one”, but the thoughts, do miss sometimes the life that was not. Cause, you know, it is pefect.
Lower it about 2 inches, and drive it tiil it drops.
Sadly, in 40 years time ahead, I can’t imagine anyone will be writings stories like, or about, the ones sludgo does. The times, they have a changed.
This is a nice looking car, and the build looks like it was done pretty well. This would be neat to have, probably a lot if fun to drive and way less stressful than driving a real 250k first gen gt or 500k second gen one. Bet it gets more looks than a repop cobra.

My 1st bike was a RD125, age and DL restrictions limited it to that. Actually was supposed to be a 100, but somehow I got around that. Just as well, with a jacket and full face helmet I was barely pushing a buck 25, so the RD125 was just right weight and size. A friend had a “not stock” RD 350 that was a SCREAMER, it would wake the dead and scare them back in one pass. Fasted thing I had ever seen, took nerves of steel to ride. He breathed on my 125 a little, not a lot of top end, but it would get there VERY quick!
We had a friend who had an RD250 with 350 jugs which made a very nice bike. As fast as a 350, but lighter and easier to ride, and a little “deeper” sound. This bike should be a great ride and the faring’s and color are perfect. It is very tempting.
@rustyspokes, do you know of a reliable shipper, and would you be able to crate it up for a trip to the southeast?
If you need the speedo working on this, you ain’t driving it right!
Is there an invoice for the engine work done?
There is nothing like “feeling” the exhaust note. A four barrel intake is wonderful too, just sounds evil. Exhaust sounds mean. A tube muffler, or smitty’s, can make just about anything sound “good”.
We used to use balloons, doubled up or really thick ones, in the spokes. Didn’t last as long as cards, but, wow, what a sound. Never will forget it.
The thing I find most fascinating about these stories, and sludgo in particular, is that even though we had very different early lives, in different parts of the country, we have arrived at a very similar point in the way we see the world. Somehow everything just hits a chord. Love it, just freaking love it.
No turn signals or mirrors, this bike will demand you be an observant rider in more ways than one. Love the style and look, wish I lived closer to it.
Like riding around in a living room.
Nice car. Not to be negative, but, who rebuilds an engine to the extent this one was, and not put a new dist. cap on it at that time?

"CHESTERFIELD, Mo., (January 26, 2016) – Today’s consumers, especially millennials, have a microscope on how their food is grown and sourced sustainably. Terms like local, organic and natural dominate the marketplace, but what does it all mean? One of the most tangible examples of sustainability is drastically fewer resources being used. In terms of the dairy industry, since 1944, today’s farmers are using just 21 percent of the animals, 35 percent of water and 10 percent of the land required to produce the same amount of milk.
In defining sustainability, the panel agreed with Steve Peterson, food industry sustainability expert and former General Mills executive, that sustainability boils down to two questions; where does my food come from? and how is it cared for? As trends continually evolve, consumers are increasingly interested in learning more about their food and engaging in a dialogue with farmers/ranchers and the agricultural supply chain. And this trend resonates with these farmers who care immensely about their customers.
“I think one of the neat things about American agriculture is that it allows us to respond to the wishes of the consumer, and that’s what I’m doing as a farmer,” said Greg Zwald of White Pine Berry Farm in River Falls, Wis.
To represent consumers’ growing curiosity about their food supply, Lauren Lindsley, RDN, CD, dietitian manager for Skogen’s Festival Foods, shared with attendees at the Food Dialogues that her customers are interested in hearing the story behind each family farm that supplies their food because, for Wisconsin dairy farmers, it’s more than just milk that customers take off the shelf. People connect with people, and customers are now learning more about the “why” instead of accepting the “what”. Today, 97 percent of U.S. farms are family-owned, according to the USDA 2012 Census of Agriculture.

"Here is an 11 year old who is just getting started at the house of math. His primary assignment is to work on multiplication.
While he is doing that, I expose him to various basic math concepts. He has played in algebra and fractions, and he is seeing that multiplication helps because it allows you count quickly. This gives some motivation to work on his multiplication. I specifically tell him (and his parents) not to just drill on multiplication tables but to play games, listen to music, and generally mix it up so it doesn't become tedious and boring.
We also work on addends...addition and multiplication are just ways of counting quickly. We need to be able to count quickly in order to math but math IS NOT computation in and of itself.
In just three lessons he has already come a long way.
The third lesson is a lesson on fractions if you'd like to see it you need a password and you can find it here (currently at the bottom of the page) called Fractions with Koa.

"In this paper, we describe an improved particle-based volume rendering (PBVR) technique for previewing a large irregular volume dataset using the CUDA architecture. This technique allows for opaque and emissive particles to render translucent volumes without visibility sorting. Our GPU acceleration of PBVR provides the multi-volume rendering feature while remaining compatible with both regular and irregular volumes. We also reduce the memory cost required for storing all sub-pixel values by proposing a pixel repetition technique for a large sub-pixel level. By adjusting the repetition level, we achieved a very smooth level of detail (LOD) control for trading quality for speed. Our work demonstrates a full-detail rendering rate from 5 to 10 fps for irregular volume data with mega-scale cell numbers on an NVIDIA GeForce 8800GTS.",en,academic

"IT’S TOO LATE began in talks with Ariel Baldwin. The content of the exhibition unfolded organically. I see it now as a love letter the contents of which are too intimate to fully impart. I feel protective over it like I imagine a mother with a wild, free, dangerous and strange child. Constant with me now, too, is the thread from a conversation I recently shared about the last crucial ingredient for a cake - what do you think it was? I want to be sure too to mention that we acknowledge the Drake album, the tension between discovering something and the possibility of invention, how it is always the end and the beginning. It's too late, it has to be okay now, and there is nothing to get.
The work is an assembly of ceremonial bells. They wait patiently and only give their voice when reached out to. The elicited sound soberly reflects both of the interlocutors, telling the subtle histories and personalities embedded deep in their resonant properties.
As the voice travels up the chest, through the tracheal tree, larynx, pharynx, oral cavity, and nasal cavity, the body rings sympathetically in complex sequences. The voice displays the body as if a container turned inside out. All its edges and idiosyncrasies are made to ring out, without need or judgement.
The syllable onset, open vowel, and closing of the mouth contain bursts of thousands of complex timbres. Focus the ear on ever shorter windows of sound, hear the phonemic shapes as abstract compositions and everything setles fully articulated. The sound wipes itself away within 100 ms.
A hand-cut acetate disk is spinning in one corner of the altar. The disk contains a composition created using elements found in the pieces. As the disk is played, the soft acetate grooves deteriorate quickly and the sound captured therein fades away. It is an archive of the installation, a record of its reception by the audience. A completely received altar will be left with a disk that is totally silent. Two copies of the record exist - one copy for the show and a second copy that will be saved to allow comparison when the installation closes.
And then, in plain English, a postscript: The meat of the exhibition is 40 of Ariel Baldwin's paintings. To me, they represent compassion, hyper violence and/or hyper sexuality, general, intellectual, existential, mild, mellow, melodramatic and/or dramatic discomfort and/or acceptance. The conversation back to the art industry seems to me to be, they aren't supposed to be pretty, or, there's nothing to get. Anders' work, -dash, is concerned with the dash between your life and death that often appears on a tombstone or in an obituary, which comes to represent your entire life. He then chooses moments and labels them by year and with a dash. Banrei's work (Jake Harper) is described below, though, in a word, it is an altar and a ritual. There are four voices which you access individually from the ground by touching a box near an object, and you can feel the sound. It comes from a record that is made of soft acetate and as such the sound on the record will slowly morph and then disappear after about 25 plays.
I see all the artists together as first the human (Ariel) and then the celebration of both the mundane (Anders) and the divine (Banrei) within that. And of course that it is too late. Which also means it is never too late, because anything too late demands a new beginning. Sometimes the shape of that is uncertain. The work is in a conversation with the industry in that way, too. Lastly, I will say that it is a bit uncanny how the theme unfolded in all of our lives as serendipitously as it came to all of us.",en,books

Six groups funded by dozens of ultra-wealthy donors have raised more than $50 million to support President Donald Trump and his agenda since his inauguration, a sharp reversal from his three-year-old pledge to be independent from moneyed interests, a Public Citizen analysis (PDF) has found. The analysis of Federal Election Commission data found that since the start of 2017, the six pro-Trump groups had raised $54.4 million from 136 megacontributors who donated at least $100,000 each, with an average contribution of nearly $400,000. The money has been used to promote Trump’s agenda through ads and support Republican candidates.
These six groups, including America First Action and Trump Victory, are fueled with contributions from corporate CEOs, largely from the gambling, finance, real estate and energy sectors, as well as from dark money groups that do not disclose their donors. For the report, Public Citizen analyzed contributions by the six largest groups used by big-money donors to support Trump and Vice President Mike Pence from January 2017 to mid-October 2018. The analysis excludes Trump’s official campaign committee, which is subject to the federal $2,700 cap on individual donations.
As the 2020 election season gets underway, the report highlights the growing influence of Trump’s fundraising operation and provides further evidence that moneyed interests, rather than the working class, are the true beneficiaries of Trump’s presidency. With significant contributions from the gambling, finance, real estate and energy sectors, Trump’s bogus claim to be a populist president looking after the common man rings ever hollower.
Sheldon Adelson, CEO of Las Vegas Sands Corp., and his wife, Miriam, are the largest donors to pro-Trump groups to date. The Adelsons have also been major donors to Republicans and to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Adelson pushed hard to relocate the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem and also for the U.S. to quit the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. The Trump administration granted Adelson’s wishes on both issues. Adelson has also pushed to build a casino in Japan – an issue that Trump himself brought up with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, according to a report by ProPublica. Preposterously, Trump awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Miriam Adelson. The couple’s main achievement: They have given nearly $300 million to Republican causes since 2012, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.
The president of the Hawaiian Gardens Casino in Long Beach, Calif., Moskowitz was married to Irving Moskowitz, a controversial physician, hospital owner, bingo parlor owner and philanthropist who died in 2016. The couple have been major supporters of the right-wing Israeli settler movement, funding some of the most controversial Jewish settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.
The Fertittas are billionaire Las Vegas brothers, whose father was a casino developer. They profited massivelyfrom the 2016 sale of their stake in Ultimate Fighting Championship, which promotes mixed martial arts fights. They are the top executives at Red Rock Resorts, a publicly traded company and the parent company of Station Casinos LLC, which owners 20 Las Vegas area casinos and manages a tribal casino in Northern California. Along with several casino magnates, the Fertittas, who know Trump from his Atlantic City casino days, when Trump hosted mixed martial arts fights at his casinos.

Craig Estey and his wife Patricia are major conservative donors. Craig Estey is founder of Nevada Restaurant Services, which owns more than 200 tavern-casinos that operate in several Western states. The company’s Dotty’s slot parlors feature delis and salad bars in addition to slot machines.
Wynn, the casino magnate, is a former Trump business rival who evolved into a Trump friend and donor. Wynn resigned as the Republican National Committee’s finance chair amid sexual assault allegations. Trump, however, did not sever ties with the casino mogul and former CEO of Wynn Resorts. The Trump super PAC America First Action said it would not return a $500,000 donation from Wynn after the sexual abuse scandal broke. Wynn stepped down from his company, but denied the allegations.
Ricketts, founder of investment firm TD Ameritrade, and his wife Marlene, spent millions to oppose Trump in the primary, backing a PAC running ads attacking his candidacy. Two months before the 2016 election, the Ricketts family, which controls the Chicago Cubs, decided to back Trump. Ricketts’ son, Todd Ricketts, was initially nominated to serve as the second-ranking official in the U.S. Commerce Department, but withdrew his name. Todd Ricketts was named finance chairman of the Republican National Committee, replacing Steve Wynn.
Schwab, the founder of the stock brokerage firm that bears his name, and his wife Helen have been big supporters of Trump, donating $1 million to Trump’s inaugural committee and his legal defense fund. Their 21-year-old granddaughter, Samantha, was hired to work in the White House. Meanwhile, lobbyists for the Charles Schwab brokerage firm have been pushing the Securities and Exchange Commission to weaken a proposal for investor-protection standards.
Singer is the billionaire founder and CEO of hedge fund Elliott Management Group, is a longtime Republican donor who opposed Trump during the primary season. The conservative Washington Free Beacon, a news organization funded by Singer, paid for the opposition research firm Fusion GPS to dig up damaging information on Trump, a project that was taken over by a law firm tied to the Democratic Party and Clinton campaign, leading to the production of a dossier that first outlined allegations of Trump’s connections to Russia. Former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon vowed to declare war on Singer after news broke that the Free Beacon had paid for anti-Trump research.

Schwarzman, the CEO of private equity firm Blackstone Group LP, is a frequent informal adviser to the president who has used his connections to the president to bridge tensions with China that could roil financial markets. In a 2015 interview with CNN, Schwarzman said “I’ve known Donald for 40 years, and he is the P.T. Barnum of America.” Schwarzman’s firm received a $20 billion investment from Saudi Arabia at the time Trump made his first presidential trip abroad, to Saudi Arabia. Schwarzman ran a White House CEO advisory group that was shut down after Trump equated white supremacists in Charlottesville with peaceful protesters. Schwarzman has continued to stand by Trump despite numerous controversies engulfing the administration.
One of the richest men in Alaska, Gillam died of a stroke in September 2018. The founder of McKinley Capital Management, Gillam was a college classmate of Trump. Gillam was a fierce opponent of a copper and gold mine proposed for Alaska’s Bristol Bay, where Gillam owned a fishing lodge. Gilliam, who unsuccessfully tried to become Trump’s Interior Secretary, met with Trump in March 2017. He made a $250,000 contribution to the Trump Victory Fund after Trump’s EPA reversed course and blocked the Pebble mine from moving forward.
A Los Angeles real estate developer, Palmer has been one of Trump’s most enthusiastic supporters. Palmer is known in Los Angeles for building “garish” luxury buildings with skywalks that allow residents to avoid encountering homeless people on the city’s streets. Palmer has fought affordable housing requirements and has been criticized for building a “series of fortress-like faux-Italian apartment blocks.
Li and Wang are New York developers who proposed in 2013 to build a “China City” in rural New York State, which is now being billed as a Chinese education center. Little is known about the pair, who have become major Republican donors since Trump’s election. They are now working on a new project at the same location in the Catskill mountains. Known as the Thompson Education Center, the project is designed to attract Chinese investors under the controversial federal EB-5 program, through which overseas investors can receive green cards.
Chera is a New York real estate mogul, founder of Crown Acquisitions, a family real estate company.Like many in the New York real estate world, he and his wife Frieda, are Trump supporters.
A billionaire banker and distressed asset investor, Beal is a longtime Trump friend and business partner who loaned nearly $500 million to Trump’s failed casino business. Beal purchased a failing natural gas power plant out of bankruptcy and sought to alter electricity market rules to keep the plant running profitably. However, federal electricity regulators unanimously rejected this proposal. Beal has also taken control of a major natural gas power plant in Arizona that is subject to federal regulation.
Murray Energy, the largest U.S. private coal company, is run by a close Trump ally, CEO Robert Murray. A climate change denier, Murray developed six deregulatory executive orders and submitted them to the Trump administration offering ways to prop up the coal industry. The company cited its flagging finances in pushing for coal and nuclear subsidies, including the potential impact on union worker retirement plans. Days after Murray made a written request for bailout assistance, the company donated $1 million to America First Action.
The Oklahoma oil billionaire Harold Hamm, CEO of the shale oil drilling company Continental Resources Inc. is a key Trump ally on energy, who got a top seat at Trump’s inauguration. He was an energy adviser to 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney and developed a relationship with Trump starting in late 2012. A board member of America First Policies, Hamm has aggressively promoted fossil fuel exploration on federal lands and was a supporter of former Trump EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, a fellow Oklahoman.
Wright and Rastin, an Ohio couple, are major Republican donors. Wright is CEO of Ariel Corp., which makes natural gas compressors, while Rastin is an executive at the company. The company supports legislationrequiring the government giving natural gas vehicles the same regulatory treatment as electric vehicles.
A Houston billionaire and former diplomat, Hushang Ansary was formerly Iran’s ambassador to the U.S. A Republican donor and backer of Jeb Bush’s presidential campaign, Hushang Ansary was formerly chairman of oil and gas equipment firm Stewart & Stevenson LLC, which he sold for $710 million in 2017. He is also chairman of Parman Capital Group LLC.
A firm tied to Igor Fruman, Russian-speaking Ukrainian businessman and Lev Parnas, a Russian-born businessman. Subject of a complaint from the Campaign Legal Center alleging that Global Energy Producers may be a shell donor created to funnel undisclosed donations to the super PAC. The firm told the Daily Beast that the donation “was a 100% legal contribution made by American citizens who immigrated to this country to flee Eastern European oppression and chase their American dream.” The company says it is working on a plan to export liquefied natural gas from the U.S.
An executive and a lawyer in New Jersey, Greenstein quit his job as chairman of telecommunications company IDT Corp. to work as a White House official from February 2017 to March 2018. Greenstein was described by Politico as a longtime family friend of Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law. Greenstein formerly was president of Genie Energy, an energy firm with operations in the U.S. and Israel. The firm’s Israeli operation is headed by a far-right Israeli politician who has met with former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke.
Kimmelman, a former Goldman Sachs partner, is founder of Energy Capital Partners, a private equity firm that has become one of the largest owners of fossil fuel power plants and also owns a nuclear waste managementcompany. In 2014, Public Citizen alleged that Energy Capital Partners manipulated electricity prices by purchasing a major coal-fired power plant in Massachusetts and announcing its closure shortly before an electricity market auction, pushing up the market rate charged by its other plants in the region. Kimmelman peronally donated $50,000 to Florida Gov. Rick Scott, after the state made pension investments in Energy Capital Partners, according to a report by Maplight and Capital & Main.
Perkins is CEO of AshBritt Inc., a Florida debris-hauling company that has often been hired by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to respond to hurricanes, floods and wildfires. Perkins is a former Democratic candidate for Congress, whose company has faced a long string of price-gouging allegations in Florida and California. Officials in California have been concerned about the high costs of a $1.3 billion fire cleanup involving AshBritt, in which one worker was killed. Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, a Trump ally, in 2017 issued a subpoena to AshBritt over “delays and potential price increases” involving hurricane cleanup. The Campaign Legal Center filed a complaint against Ashbritt, alleging that it violated a ban on active federal contractors making political contributions. The contribution was later updated to list Perkins as the donor. Perkins told Roll Call that the donation was mistakenly reported as a corporate donation rather than a personal one.
Snyder, the controversial owner of the Washington Redskins, is one of several NFL team owners who have donated to Trump. In addition to his donation to Trump Victory, Snyder also donated $1 million to Trump’s inaugural festivities. The Redskins, who want to build a new football stadium, recently advocated to extend the District of Columbia’s lease on the federally owned site of the Redskins’ former home, RFK Stadium, opening up land to residential and commercial development, including a new stadium. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan has also pitched a land swap with the Interior Department in an effort to keep the team in Maryland.
Lindell, the TV pitchman and inventor famous for selling foam pillows on television, is also a big Trump supporter. Lindell has called Trump the “best president this country has ever had.” He faced a boycott after declining to pull advertising from Fox News’ Laura Ingraham’s show when she mocked a survivor of the Parkland High school shooting.
U.S. House Democrats have released emails that raise serious concerns about whether President Donald Trump personally directed government officials to prevent the relocation of the FBI’s headquarters from its Pennsylvania Avenue location in Washington, D.C.
Trump’s D.C. hotel opened before the 2016 presidential election. It was constructed in a public building, the Old Post Office, and has created the highly unusual situation of a president deriving financial benefit from a business located just blocks from the White House. The hotel has become a watering hole for those seeking to influence the Trump administration.
This president leases property from the United States government, in plain violation of the lease terms that say it cannot be leased to a government official. His hotel hosts foreign governments and trade associations that hold dozens of events there in order to curry favor with him.
Trump’s interference in an office relocation decision, which would replace the FBI’s deteriorating headquarters with a new suburban site, implies the purpose of protecting ill-gotten profits from a government property where Trump is plainly violating the lease terms.
If Trump is willing to do this, of course we should worry that his business operations are affecting his policies on Saudi Arabia, taxes and clean water rules.
No impact on his business operations is too petty to escape his concern. No law, rule or modicum of ethical decency is sufficient to deter his readiness to abuse his power in service of his narrow, narrow interests.
These revelations make clear yet again that the only way for Trump to escape from the pervasive conflicts of interest that are defining his presidency is to divest all of his business holdings, immediately.
Until Donald Trump took office, ethics experts believed the system of conflict-of-interest rules and norms governing the White House and the rest of the executive branch was fairly robust.
The Trump presidency, however, has exposed big holes in the system. According to Public Citizen’s ethics experts, the U.S. never before has had a president so intent on subverting federal ethics laws as well as ethical norms.
A report (PDF)recently published by Public Citizen and Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington outlines a host of policy reforms to ensure that future presidents can’t repeat the Trump-era abuses.
“No president has pushed ethical boundaries like Trump,” said Lisa Gilbert, vice president of legislative affairs at Public Citizen. “The only silver lining is that because of Trump, we now know how to strengthen the system against future presidents who lack an ethical compass.” Trump differs starkly from all of his modern day predecessors – and likely all presidents in U.S. history – due to the breadth of his assets, his refusal to divest himself of those assets and his cavalier attitude toward multiple conflicts of interest.
Upon assuming the presidency, Trump maintained ownership of his businesses around the globe, leaving him vulnerable to the influence of foreign governments and other corporate interests. While Trump turned over day-to-day control of his business to his sons, he has spent roughly a third of his time at Trump properties. While in office, Trump has promoted his private businesses and hosted special interest groups, foreign governments and political groups at his own properties.
What Can Be Done: Within 30 days of the presidential inauguration, the president and vice president should be required to divest assets that pose a risk of conflict of interest. The U.S. Congress should give enforcement authority to the U.S. Office of Government Ethics or create an inspector general’s office to investigate potential ethics violations in the White House and executive branch.
Trump’s refusal to release his tax returns deprived voters of information about financial ties that may have a bearing on Trump’s decisions. It has painted a confusing and complex picture of his finances and business entanglements for the press and public to decipher.
What Can Be Done: Candidates for president and vice president must be required to disclose their tax returns before their election and in subsequent years after holding office. Candidates and officials also should be required to disclose the value of their assets, income, transactions and liabilities as well as details of any privately held businesses. That way, voters can better determine whether the candidate has a financial conflict of interest — such as business ties in other countries that could affect foreign policy decisions.
Trump’s inaugural committee raised $107 million from corporations and wealthy individuals to pay for the 2016 inauguration, twice as much as was raised by President Barack Obama’s inaugural committees. The Trump committee refused to say where the money went, though tax filings revealed that nearly $26 million went to an event planning firm started by an adviser to Melania Trump — leading to the appearance of insider dealing.
What Can Be Done: Contributions to inaugural committees should be capped at $5,000 — the federal contribution limit for an election cycle. While in office, presidents either should be prevented from collecting money for libraries or other legacy-building endeavors, or those contributions should be subject to the same rules as contributions from candidates running for federal office. In addition, rules and disclosure requirements should be established for legal defense funds set up by executive branch officials.
Trump placed his daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner in key White House jobs despite a federal anti-nepotism statute that makes it illegal to appoint close relatives to official positions. To do so, Trump relied on a legal opinion asserting that the president has authority to hire White House positions without oversight.
What Can Be Done: The law banning presidents from hiring immediate family members, enacted in the 1960s after President John F. Kennedy appointed his brother as attorney general, should be clarified to make clear that it supersedes other laws on White House employment.
“I did work for a coal company and I’m not ashamed of the work I did for a coal company,” the new head of the Environmental Protection Agency, Andrew Wheeler, recently told agency employees.
Wheeler’s statements highight an unfortunate reality in the wake of former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt’s resignation last week: Fans of clean air and water should know that many more challenges await. After all, Wheeler’s background could hardly be less inspiring.With his close ties to the fossil fuel industry, Wheeler is cut from the same cloth as Pruit, who resigned in the face of 13 current federal inquiries, sustained public activism and the redefinition of how many scandalous reservations a cabinet-level official can endure before heading for the exits.
Until last year, Wheeler worked as the top lobbyist for Murray Energy, the largest underground coal mining company in the country.
Murray Energy’s CEO, Robert Murray, is a top Trump backer, having donated $300,000 to the president’s inaugural fund. Months later, the company provided the Trump administration with an “Action Plan” that called for cutting the staff at the EPA in half and subsidizing coal-fired power plants, among other things. Four days after that memo was authored, Murray Energy gave $1 million to a Trump-tied Super PAC. Wheeler helped Murray secure a meeting with Energy Secretary Perry in spring 2017 as Murray pushed for a sendless bailout of dirty coal power.
Earlier in his career, Wheeler worked as a top aide to Sen. James Inhofe. Inhofe is perhaps the most infamous climate change denier in Congress, after memorably using the presence of snow in February in Washington, D.C. as evidence against global warming.
Wheeler first appeared on Public Citizen’s radar two decades ago, while working as counsel for that same committee, when he receieved a free trips to Las Vegas and New Orleans for the purpose of a proposed nuclear waste disposal site and a power plant. His New Orleans stay happened to coincide with the Jazz Festival in New Orleans, where he stayed at the four-star Westin Canal Place Hotel in the French Quarter, offering a heated rooftop pool, complete health club facilities and a marble bath.
The EPA was founded in a bipartisan fashion and there is clear public support for stronger environmental regulations. For example, a recent poll found supporters of a solar panel mandate for new houses outnumbered opponents by almost three to one.
No one should lead the EPA unless he or she can demonstrate a commitment to protecting EPA’s mission — our health, and our environment.
At President Donald Trump’s hotels, golf courses and restaurants, you can check out any time you like, but the conflicts of interest never disappear.
WATCH: President and Melania Trump At Trump Hotel in DC tonight.
At the start of his administration, Trump turned over control of businesses to his sons Don Jr. and Eric, but still controls the trust that owns the properties and can withdraw money whenever he likes. And Trump’s family still benefits from his properties. Recently posted financial disclosures reveal that Trump’s daughter, Ivanka Trump, who also is a White House official, made $3.9 million last year from her stake in the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C.
Public Citizen has kept a close watch over who is spending money at Trump properties and has documented 204 instances of trade groups, companies, religious groups, charities, foreign governments, interest groups and political candidates staying in Trump properties or spending money there. This tally is more than triple what we counted in our first look at the issue in January.
Our tally highlights who is most enthusiastically embracing Trump and unabashedly basking in the culture of self-enrichment and influence-peddling permeating his circle. For instance, donors paid at least $100,000 per person ($250,000 for VIP status) to attend the June 18-19 “leadership summit” of Trump super PAC America First Action, which featured Trump himself and assorted luminaries, including former press secretary Sean Spicer.
The steady drumbeat of events at Trump properties may bolster the argument of state officials in Maryland and the District of Columbia who have filed a lawsuit alleging that Trump is violating the U.S. Constitution’s ban on payments from foreign governments to U.S. officials. Trump has “affirmatively encouraged foreign governments to augment his considerable wealth by doing business with his businesses,” Maryland Solicitor General Steven Sullivan told a federal judge this month.
For their part, Trump administration officials claim there’s nothing improper going on, contending there is no expectation of payback or quid pro quo, and that Trump is not responsible for a foreign official’s effort to sow favor with the government. The Constitution “didn’t intend to prohibit a private commercial transaction,” U.S. Department of Justice lawyer Brett Shumate told the judge overseeing the case.
Some of the interaction between international elites and Trump confidantes is happening right in the open on social media. On June 12, Philippine Ambassador Jose Manuel “Babe” del Gallego Romualdez celebrated the 120th anniversary of his country’s independence at Trump’s D.C. hotel. Trump has boasted of his “great relationship” with Rodrigo Duterte, the country’s president, and has expressed admiration for the Duterte government’s executions of drug dealers.
In 2017, Hary Tanoesoedibjo‏, a billionaire Indonesian developer, posted on social media a picture of himself and Trump son Eric celebrating Trump’s inauguration at the Trump’s Washington, D.C. hotel. Tanoesoedibjo is no stranger to the Trump family. His company is building a Trump-branded hotel and golf course in Indonesia – with help from the Indonesian government and a state-owned Chinese company.
To compile our list, Public Citizen analyzed campaign records, press clips and social media posts as well as other efforts to document Trump’s swamp of corruption. Especially helpful were the Washington Post’s tally of events held at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., as well as an excellent running log of the hotel’s visitors, based largely on scouring social media sites, posted on Twitter by journalist Zach Everson.
The Seasonal Employment Alliance, which represents businesses that use overseas guest workers.
The National Mining Association, which held a board of directors meeting featuring U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in October 2017. Perry himself tweeted about the event.
Medical device company Align Technology, which was in Washington, D.C., for an orthodontist conference.
The Community Financial Services Association, which represents high-rate payday lenders, held their annual conference– and a golf tournament – at the Trump National Doral Golf Club near Miami, drawing protests outside the club’s gates.
The list also reveals numerous foreign visitors making appearances at Trump properties, including the Kuwaiti ambassador to the U.S., Salem Abdullah Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, as evidenced by this post (the original was deleted from Instagram).
Trump’s guests also include far-right organizations such as the Sovereign Nations Conference, which warns on its website that “the entire foundation of law and justice been cast aside in an all-out embrace of Marxist sourced social justice conformity.” And conspiracy theorist Jack Posobiec, a correspondent for One America News, made a recent appearance.
After returning from D.C., Sheets recapped the event enthusiastically, writing, “The government – the exposing of unrighteousness in government (Congress, the Executive Branch, the Supreme Court and even the embedded ‘Deep State’ with its liberal, humanistic, anti-Christian agenda) and the return to our Judeo-Christian roots will increase. Nothing will stop this” (emphasis in original).
As we documented in April, Trump‘s businesses have received millions from his political activities. Trump, his campaign and Republican political committees have directed millions in campaign and public money to Trump’s own hotels, airplanes, restaurants, golf courses and even a bottled water company. Trump’s hotel in the nation’s capital, just blocks from the White House, brought in $40 million in revenue during Trump’s first year in office. However, revenue was weak at other properties, such as the Mar-A-Lago club in Florida. That property suffered from the cancellation of several charity events due to Trump-related controversy.
Trump came to office with the most blatant corrupting conflicts of interest in the history of American politics, so what followed should not be a surprise. By spending money at his properties, corporations and foreign governments are being transparent about their desire to curry favor with the president and influence the Trump administration’s policies.
See here for the full spreadsheet.
The Trump administration has withdrawn or paused more than 1,500 rulemakings. This total vastly exceeds the number under President Obama at this period of his administration, and roughly parallels the number under President George W. Bush. Trump has blocked more rulemakings deemed “significant” due to their economic impact or other factors than Bush. These findings are the focus of a new Public Citizen report.
The Trump administration has bragged that it has eliminated “nearly 1,000 regulations.” This claim is somewhat misleading. In fact, most of the regulations that the administration claims to have scuttled were rulemakings in progress that had yet to be finalized, as opposed to regulations already on the books that have been eliminated.
We count rulemakings that have been halted as those listed as withdrawn on the Unified Agenda. We count as delayed those rulemakings that are listed for the first time on the “long-term actions” stage or moved to the inactive list.
1 – Withdrawn rulemakings – The Trump administration has withdrawn more than 780 rulemakings. That is an 85 percent increase compared to the Obama administration’s first three agendas and a 3 percent decrease compared to the first three agendas submitted by the George W. Bush administration.
Of Trump’s withdrawn rulemakings, 279 were deemed “significant.” Rulemakings are given the status of “economically significant” if they are projected to have an economic impact of more than $100 million and are given “other significant” status if they meet certain criteria, such as raising novel policy issues or affecting multiple agencies. The Trump administration’s number of significant rulemakings withdrawn by this point in the president’s term was 77 percent more than the Obama administration and 26 percent more than the George W. Bush administration.
2 – Active rulemakings moved to long-term – The Trump administration moved 583 rulemakings to long-term actions over its first three agendas. The total is 28 percent more than the Obama administration but 16 percent less than the Bush administration.
Of these, 209 were significant. That total is 7 percent more than the Obama administration total but 12 percent less than the Bush administration’s.
3 – Rulemakings moved to inactive – The Trump administration moved 328 rulemakings to inactive status. Of these, 41 percent were significant.
Examples of rulemakings that the Trump administration has terminated or postponed include one that would have addressed the hazards that led to the 2010 Upper Big Branch mine disaster, which killed 29 people.
Others would have protected workers from vehicles backing up, which are one of the top causes of workplace fatalities, prevent explosions from combustible dust and reduce emissions of the potent greenhouse gas methane, to name a few.
The data in this report show that Trump has already scuttled hundreds public protections. The data are telling. But what the data do not convey is the human cost. As a result of the administration’s deregulatory fervor, there will be no combustible dust standard anytime soon. The hazards exposed in the Upper Big Branch mine disaster won’t be addressed. Efforts to prevent backover deaths in the workplace, to make trains safer, and to reduce greenhouse gases have all been blocked, for now.
This regulatory inaction will lead to preventable death and disease. While we may not yet know the names of those needlessly killed or injured by the administration’s determined inaction, we do know that people will die and suffer needlessly.
Is Carl Icahn Getting the Last Laugh?
If at first you don’t get a regulatory rollback, try, try again. That appears to be the reality in Donald Trump’s Washington.
After pushing unsuccessfully for regulatory changes that would benefit his oil refining business, billionaire Carl Icahn appears to have found a new way to accomplish the same goal.
At the start of the Trump administration, Icahn pushed to save his company $200 million per year by shifting responsibility for blending ethanol and biodiesel to wholesale gasoline distributors, rather than oil refiners like Icahn’s CVR Energy. A close Trump friend, Icahn served for several months as a special regulatory adviser to President Donald Trump, but stepped down amind intense scrutiny of Icahn’s effort to influence regulations.
Icahn appeared to have lost this battle and faces a federal probe into his efforts to influence energy policy. But a new report suggests that Icahn may have found another way to win the larger war. According to Reuters, the EPA has granted a waiver worth tens of millions to an Oklahoma oil refinery controlled by Icahn. The EPA gave Icahn’s refinery a hardship waiver, according to Reuters, even though Icahn’s two refineries — Coffeyville in Kansas and Wynnewood in Oklahoma — posted a combined gross profit of $286 million in 2017 and $115 million in the first three months of 2018.
Reporting suggests that the EPA is granting more of these waivers than ever before, but the government officially keeps waiver recipients secret. Because the granting of waivers affects the markets, they should be public, and Congress should investigate the increased number of waivers the EPA is issuing.
CVR Energy is required to purchase credits to comply with federal renewable fuels mandate enacted under President George W. Bush In his role as special adviser to Trump on regulations, Icahn had an official public platform to push for changes to this mandate and associated program – and stands to benefit from his bet against prices for biofuel credits.
Disturbed by this blatant conflict of interest, Public Citizen last year called on Congress to investigate whether Icahn, Icahn Enterprises or CVR Energy violated the Lobbying Disclosure Act in pushing Trump to change the structure of the federal Renewable Fuel Standard in a way that would be profitable for Icahn.
For the past year, Icahn has counting on his political influence to persuade the Trump administration to change ethanol rules – while making tens of millions in profits. He appears to finally have succeeded.
While Trump did not turn a profit on his campaign, his businesses have received millions. Trump, his campaign and Republican political committees have directed millions in campaign and public money to Trump’s own hotels, airplanes, restaurants, golf courses and even a bottled water company.
Public Citizen has compiled all known records of political and federal taxpayer spending at Trump properties and businesses in the U.S. We found that President Trump’s U.S. businesses have raked in $15.1 million in revenue from political groups as well as federal agencies during his campaign and presidency. About 90 percent of the spending, or $13.2 million, came from Trump’s own campaign. In addition, more than $717,000 came from the Republican National Committee and nearly $595,000 from Trump Victory, the joint fundraising committee set up by Trump’s campaign and the RNC. About $160,000 came from Republican candidates and conservative political groups, according to Public Citizen’s analysis.
Trump’s propensity for travel to his own resorts and dining at his own restaurants has resulted in considerable spending of tax dollars at Trump-owned properties. Yet it is hard to assess precisely how much money has been spent, as information about spending by federal agencies at Trump properties is just starting to trickle out.

Public Citizen’s analysis found that more than $9.2 million in political spending, or more than 60 percent, went to Tag Air Inc., which controls Trump’s 757 airplane, customized with gold-plated bathroom faucets and seatbelts. The Wall Street Journal reported in December 2016 that this plane is owned by a Trump-owned company, DJT Operations I LLC, which leases the aircraft to Tag Air. The Journal noted that this ownership strategy is often used by jet owners to avoid paying up-front sales taxes and instead pay sales tax on lease payments. According to Politico, the Trump campaign was eligible for reimbursements from the Secret Service to cover air travel costs for agents that protected the candidate.
Sources: Public Citizen tally of Secret Service records for Feb-April 2017, Defense Department records obtained through FOIA and tallied by Property of the People. GSA documents, other records obtained through FOIA by Property of the People.
After the election, a Trump presidential transition staffer raised the prospect of using public money to pay for a transition team lease at Trump Tower, writing “Can we get the details again of how to pay for a lease of Trump Tower in NYC?” to a federal official, according to a report by the Center for Public Integrity. Trump’s inaugural committee, meanwhile, raised a record $107 million from corporate donors and rich individuals and paid nearly $26 million to an event-planning firm founded by a friend of Melania Trump, the first lady.
During Trump’s presidency, presidential excursions to Trump properties in Florida, New Jersey and Virginia have become commonplace, leading to government spending at Trump’s properties, as well as considerable bills for golf cart rentals.
Unfortunately, there is no single repository of how much money federal agencies spend at Trump properties.Federal agencies have started to disclose some travel records as a result of requests filed under the Freedom of Information Act. The Secret Service, responding to records requests by Public Citizen and other organizations, has released some information on spending at Trump’s Florida properties during early 2017. Other FOIA requests by Property of the People have unearthed invoices and other information.
The relationship between Trump’s businesses and the U.S. government hasn’t been without conflict. One dispute between a Trump business and the federal government spilled into public view last fall, when the Washington Post reported that the Secret Service left its command post inside Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan after a dispute about lease terms. That Secret Service was relocated to a trailer on the street.
As Trump ramps up his 2020 reelection campaign, spending from the Republican Party is likely to keep growing. The Republican National Committee has been covering the $37,000 per month cost of the Trump campaign’s New York office space, since September 2017, according to a CNBC report. That arrangement appears to be legal and properly disclosed, but still highly unusual. “One would think the RNC could be spending their money more effectively right now on the 2018 campaign, rather than spending it to pay Trump’s rent.” Brendan Fischer, senior counsel for the Campaign Legal Center, told CNBC.
Trump’s properties, especially his hotel in Washington, have hosted dozens of conferences, dinners — from the American Petroleum Institute to the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association to a conference for the vaping industry But except from rare cases, such as sa $270,000 event held by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the amount of money spent at those events is hidden from public view.
The Trump Organization, which runs Trump’s businesses, attempted to allay concerns about foreign influence on the Trump administration by donating profits from foreign governments. Earlier this year, the company wrote a $151,470 check to the U.S. Treasury. However, company officials released no details about how they made this calculation, or which governments have been patronizing Trump properties.
Americans’ justifable cynicism about Washington, D.C. helped propel Trump into White House. But rather than fix our government, Trump’s penchant for self-dealing has validated every bit of the public’s disenchantement with our nation’s leaders.
“We’re not burning it down.” That’s Mick Mulvaney describing his management of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). Yet he keeps setting fires – terminating enforcement, ignoring supervision, slashing funding, leaving vacancies unfilled and closing outstanding cases.
He has failed to announce any new enforcement actions. The last enforcement action announced by the CFPB was on 21, 2017, which involved Citibank student loan services failures. Prior to that, the bureau took action at least once a week, sometimes more. These cases involve firms that deceived borrowers, illegally posing as government agents, stealing from consumers, lying to loan officers and more, and have returned $12 billion to more than 28 million victims. But since Mulvaney took over, there have been zero enforcement actions.
He terminated numerous cases against firms, including at least one at a firm that contributed to his campaign for Congress. World Acceptance Corp. received a CFPB letter in January telling it that it would no longer be under investigation, following four years of work by the agency. The firm had contributed $4,500 to Mulvaney’s campaigns when he ran successfully for Congress from South Carolina.
He sidelined a rule meant to reduce abuse by loan sharks. On Jan. 16, 2018, Mulvaney announced that he “intends to engage in a rulemaking process so that the Bureau may reconsider the Payday Rule.” Already, the CFPB invested five years drafting this rule, incorporating a million public comments and countless meetings and roundtables with industry and consumer advocates.
He defanged the Office of Fair Lending and Equal Opportunity, a team responsible for combating racist lending. Defying the statute, Mulvaney summarily stripped it of oversight and enforcement powers.
He requested $0 funding for his first quarter of operations, drawing down reserves.
He placed political operatives, many from the House Financial Services Committee, in key supervisory positions. The law requires the CFPB to hire exclusively on merit.
He has ordered a foundational policy review of virtually all of the CFPB activities, from enforcement to rulemaking. Specifically, he is asking firms suspected of abuse to file public comments.
He rewrote the CFPB’s mission statement, adding protection of Wall Street as a goal, which most would say is the exact opposite of his agency’s mission.
Congress created the CFPB in response to reckless, fraudulent and predatory lending that caused the financial crash of 2008. Existing bank regulators didn’t deal with this conduct because they were concentrating on industry profits as a proxy for safety and soundness, which they viewed as their primary oversight mandate. Those profits, however, came from a business model based on unfair, deceptive and abusive practices.
Public Citizen fought especially keenly for the creation of this agency in Congress. Then-Harvard Law School Prof. Elizabeth Warren conceived it in a paper titled “Unsafe at Any Rate,” an homage to Public Citizen founder Ralph Nader’s “Unsafe at Any Speed.” Consumers deserve dedicated protection against Wall Street’s scams just as they do against shoddy automobile manufacture and exploding toasters.
Whether Mulvaney savages the agency to oblige his former campaign sponsors or to fulfill his anti-government nihilism, it all amounts to political arson. Eventually, Trump will have to nominate a permanent director who faces Senate confirmation, as the law provides. Until then, we can only hope that the fires Mulvaney has set don’t rage out of control.",en,web
"OUT OF BOUNDS: The photo above, Shadow Quest by Zoya Lynch, has won the Out of Bounds photo competition for 2013.
Zoya Lynch, the only woman entered in Out of Bounds: Tales From the Backcountry photo competition, has taken the top prize of $1,000.
The Revelstoke resident's photo ""Shadow Quest"" is a monochrome image with a group of skiers making their way up a mountain at Rogers Pass.
Lynch, who has been a professional photographer for the last three years, but has been shooting for the last six, is drawn to all kinds of subjects, not just sports shots. ""I like shooting everything from recreational tourism, adventure sports, weddings, landscapes, nature shots,"" she said.
The winner of the People's Choice award and a two-day snowcat trip with Backcountry Snowcats is Bradley Slack for his photo ""Blue Room"". Just three votes behind Slack in that category was Sean St. Denis for his photo ""Into Heaven."" He wins an Arc'teryx jacket.
All three winning photos do not show skiers, said organizer Andrea Mueller of the Whistler Arts Council, suggesting a shift in public preferences.
""The exhibit looked amazing this year thanks to all the talented photographers who submitted their work,"" Mueller said, adding their Cabin Fever launch party was the biggest yet.
Workshops offered by Blake Jorgenson's Outdoor Photography Summit during the competition were sold out.
Five photos from the exhibit sold, Mueller added.",en,web
"Essentially the most widely accepted definition of well being is that of the World Health Group Constitution. It states: “health is a state of complete bodily, mental and social nicely-being and not merely the absence of illness or infirmity” ( World Well being Group , 1946). In newer years, this assertion has been amplified to incorporate the power to lead a “socially and economically productive life”. The WHO definition is not without criticism, mainly that it’s too broad. Some argue that well being can’t be defined as a state at all, however have to be seen as a dynamic means of steady adjustment to the altering demands of living. Despite its limitations, the idea of well being as outlined by WHO is broad and positive in its implications, in that it sets out a excessive customary for positive well being.

"Hello Everyone! Mindy here with you today to share with you a step-by-step coloring tutorial of the brand new Comfy Sweater Marci Rubber Stamp from La-La Land Crafts.
Step 1: First stamp Comfy Sweater Marci 2 times onto your choice of blending cardstock with Tuxedo Black Ink. Next use the Sweater Weather Background Stamp with Summer Sky Ink to stamp the sweater pattern onto one of the stamped Marci images. Then with your Copic E04 add the darkest shadow areas to the second stamped Marci image as shown below.
Step 2: Using first E11 and then E21 go over the shadow areas that you previously colored and extend your shading further down for each color used as shown below.
Step 3: Next using first E00 then E000, and lastly E0000 continue to shade over the previous shaded areas and extend the shading for each color used. Finish by coloring over the entire colored skin sections with your E0000 to blend your skin tones seamlessly.
Step 4: To give Marci her pink cheeks, add first your darker pink RV21 to the edges of Marci's cheeks. Then before the RV21 dries blend RV000 on just the edges of the RV21 towards the inside of Marci's face to give shape and depth to her cheeks.
Step 5: Using RV04 add shading to the darkest shadow areas of Marci's hat band, tank top, and leggings. Then add tiny dots along the shaded areas and extending just slightly into the non-shaded areas still using RV04.
Step 6: Repeat the same process above adding small dots over the previously shaded area and extending slightly further into the non-shaded area repeating for each color. Start with RV21, then RV10, and lastly RV000 as shown in the photo below.
Step 7: To color Marci's blonde hair, start by adding in the darkest detail lines with your E35, next go over those lines and extend further down her hair with E31.
Step 8: To finish the hair go over the same lines and extend them a bit further with E41. Then go over just the darkest shadow areas of Marci's hair with Y00 to add contrast and make the hair stand out.
Step 9: Fussy cut the hat, sweater, and boots from the second Sweater Weather stamped Marci. Paper piece the clothes by gluing them onto the coordinating areas of your colored Marci image. Next add the darkest detail and shadow lines with C3 to the hat, sweater and boots.
Step 10: To finish go over all of your C3 shadowed areas with C1 and extend the shading further. Then use a white gel pen to add highlight dots to the tights, hat, sweater, and boots.
I just Love the new Comfy Sweater Marci, she really is so much fun to color! The possibilities really are endless, and she could fit so many different occasions just depending on the color combo you use.
Thank you so much for stopping by! I hope that my coloring tutorial inspires you to try out your own creations using La-La Land Crafts Amazing stamps and dies!",en,reference

Current security scanners take two-dimension pictures of a bag’s contents while the CT scanners create 3-D images that can be viewed, rotated around three axes, and zoomed in on to get a clear picture of what’s inside.

"How do you get into the creative frame of mind? Are you inspired by facts? Visuals? Music? Stories? Surroundings? Snacks? Mmm snacks.
If you’re in advertising, you indulge in the creative brief your wonderful account planning team poured their research-intensive hearts into. The core purpose of any brief is to inspire the team to make a leap of creative faith. And strategic planning is the springboard.
If every brand is different (and it is), why are so many briefs created the same? Let’s face it. Not everyone is inspired by reading paragraphs sprinkled with facts masked as insights.
Certainly what goes into a brief is important. It’s also equally important to consider what the creative team can take away from it. When in doubt, be brief. But be insightful.
With all that said, below are two sample creative briefs for real-world brands. One of them is for a church. Yes, a church. Everyone has a brand. (Even you!) Christianity in America is certainly in need of a brand refresh. More on that later.
What do you know about the church and its history?
Northland Church is a Florida-based congregation with roots that go back to the 1960s. Today’s Senior Pastor, Dr. Joel C. Hunter, has been at Northland since 1985. Before it was a mega church, it was a close-knit community gathering in an old skating rink.
Today, Northland attracts more than 20,000 who worship around the world thanks to the connective power of the web. It’s a distributed church model, meaning Northland has more than one location, it’s a church of churches. Northland believes church is more than a building—it’s a network of spiritual families.
Whom are we talking to?
Northland serves a diverse audience. This initiative will focus on reaching millennials (adults who were born between 1981 and 1996) who have some prior experience with church, but do not regularly attend.
Millennials make up about 20 percent of the entire U.S. population. Not only are they the largest generation in the history of America, they are a progressive generation. To describe them as liberal would be a massive understatement. They grew up on the Internet. They want connection. And they want authenticity.
Millennials think a lot of things. (And the world thinks a lot of things about millennials.) This tech-savvy, social-media-obsessed generation is skeptical of organized institutions, like the government. They view the church as an institution that clings to traditions rather than strives to stay relevant.
According to Pew Research, half of millennials say they believe in God, and only about four-in-ten say religion is very important in their lives. Millennials have witnessed church scandal after church scandal after church scandal after church scandal. They are repelled by hypocritical Christians. And holier than thou preachers.
What’s the problem? Is there an overarching negative to address?
Just 27% of millennials attend religious services on a weekly basis. Even if they believe in God and consider themselves spiritual, going to church feels like something their parents and grandparents do. Millennials think they can respond to the needs of others without going to a building once a week. Therefore, churches across the nation are not attracting this key generation.
World changers, not holy rollers.
What do you know about Harbor Inn Seafood?
Harbor Inn Seafood opened its doors more than 20 years ago. It is a family-owned chain of restaurants that span North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia. Each of the six restaurants provides affordable, high-quality seafood, including a variety of broiled and fried seafood options. They are also known for delectable desserts.
Harbor Inn delivers a consistent level of quality, unlike national restaurant chains which suffer from disparate service standards that vary by location and management.
For this initiative, our target audience will be mothers. We know that moms plan the meals and coordinate family schedules. Moms know that their families are busier than ever, but the dinner table is still a place where everyone can gather, and sometimes, unplug.
We are talking to moms who also have to deal with picky eaters, but moms also care about the food that their children eat. Opting for broiled seafood over pizza once a week seems like a responsible option. And dining out is a great way to get kids to eat stuff they wouldn’t normally try at home.
Dining out means less time in the kitchen. And more time with loved ones. It’s a chance to do something as a family. Harbor Inn also has a children’s menu. Moms know that seafood is brainfood. They think Harbor Inn’s menu is reasonably priced, and they appreciate the atmosphere.
What’s the problem? What’s the negative?
In a word, competition. The marketing challenge is to distinguish Harbor Inn as unique, not just another fish in the sea of restaurant sameness.",en,reference

How do you currently split input files?

"Wishing for soft, smooth arms but can’t seem to get rid of those tiny bumps? There is a good chance you may have Keratosis pilaris or KP. It is a genetic condition that affects the skin anywhere there are hair follicles. It is harmless and often mistaken for acne but it is actually excessive keratin (a natural protein in the skin) that surrounds the skin and clogs the hair follicles in the pore. It is most often found on the back and outer sides of the upper arms but can occur on thighs, legs, hands and anywhere you have hair, regardless of how fine the hair is!
The best way to treat Keratosis Pilaris is with a chemical exfoliant skincare product which will help slough off the excessive proteins that are clogging the hair follicle. Look for body washes and lotions with any blend of alpha hydroxyl acids or AHA’s which help to melt away the proteins in the skin. One of our favorites is our ALL-IN-ONE ACNE WASH with 10% glycolic acid. You can also look for over the counter brands like Curel that have exfoliating properties like their Plus Smoothing Essentials Lotion. One thing to keep in mind is while using these lotions; you may be more susceptible to sun exposure due to the sloughing off of dead skin, so always remember your sunscreen!

"We ALL love Autumn Festivals, right? There’s something about the fall colors, crisp air, and crisper leaves crunching under your feet. October fests…or in Sugar’s case – Oktoberfest – offer all of the above and some German fare to boot. On top of all of that, if you’re a fan of the ski resorts of this region, then ANY excuse to visit a ski area is an added incentive.
I’ve tried to make Sugar’s Oktoberfest every year. With college football occasionally interfering, I’ve made three of the last four for at least a portion of the weekend. Last year we attended a football game in Columbia and left in time to drive up and get over to Oktoberfest late in the day. YEP, that’s how much we enjoy Autumn in the High Country AND this particular October festival.
THE LEAVES WILL BE AT OR NEAR PEAK AND THE WEATHER WILL BE GORGEOUS!
We’ve been blogging the NC Fall Foliage update for you guys lately and this weekend could just be the best to visit in terms of weather and beauty in and around the High Country. The leaves in the area are a little different this year, but nonetheless gorgeous. There are LOTS of rustic yellows and oranges and not as many of the brilliant reds and gold. However it is VERY PRETTY. The weather forecast for the area according to Meteorologist Kenny Griffin of www.HighCountryWeather.com will be AWESOME. How about mostly sunny skies and highs in the upper 50s to around 58°! Winds should be light around 5-10 mph which should make this very fall-like and nippy enough to wear a light jacket or sweater.
TONS OF REASONS TO COME!
Head to Sugar, grab your beer stein; put on your lederhosen (if you have them or know what they are!) and definately bring your willingness to just have fun. There will be local folk dancing and the always entertaining Harbour Town Fest Band which is loud and proud to bring viewers all of the oom pa sounds they can handle.
The Bavarian Atmosphere is great and there will be cloggers, dancers, craft vendors and even some ski and snowboard related tents, etc.
Admission, parking and shuttle service are all free.
There are things setup for the kids and in addition to all of the fun, Sugar will have their chair lifts riding to the top of the mountain. You can ride all the up AND down if you like, OR you can get off at a few different spots along the way and walk down. I and my family always take the 20-25 minute ride to the top and then hop off and walk down. It’s an easy walk since gravity does all of the work and the views from up top are awe-inspiring. Be sure to bring your cameras because there WILL BE some Kodak moments!
The festival will be going from 10am through 5pm Saturday and Sunday, but for the biggest crowd, great eats and drink – the best time to come is probably from around 11-3pm. From what I understand the Oom Pah band will be playing from noon until around 4pm each day.
DON’T EAT TIL YOU GET THERE!
Gunther, Kim and the entire Sugar Mountain family does a great job with providing phenomenal German food and drink. The Bavarian style eats include Bratwurst, Knockwurst, Sauerkraut, strudel and pretzels – and they will ALL be smelling up the place (in a GREAT WAY) and ready to eat from 11am each day. To assist the palate in washing all that down there will be an ample supply of Spaten beer that will generously flow each day until 5:00 pm.
For those unaware – including myself – Spaten Oktoberfest beer was crafted in 1872 and it is the world’s first Oktoberfest beer. Brewed for the greatest folk festival in the world, the Oktoberfest!
If you or the kids are not into Bavarian eats Sugar will also have good ole American hot dogs, hamburgers, soda, cotton candy, kettle corn, funnel cakes, candy apples, and other great stuff to munch on!
Sugar’s Ski Shop will offer 30% off all 2012 and older winter apparel and footwear. In addition to that – all Spyder Sample items will be 50-70% off. Sale prices are available ONLY during our two-day Oktoberfest from 10 am until 5 pm. All accessories including, but not limited to goggles, gloves, and hats, will be excluded from the 30% sale. New 2013 winter merchandise will also be available at regular retail. Commemorative Oktoberfest t-shirts and souvenir items can also be bought in the sports shop or under the tent on the main celebration deck.
We HIGHLY RECOMMEND calling Ph: 828-898-9746 or TOLL FREE: 800-438-4555. You can also visit www.StaySugarMountain.com as they are offering up to 30% LODGING. If you’re headed this way you might as well SAVE! Do us a favor and mention SkiSoutheast.com or ResortCams.com sent you!
Pet’s are welcome to attend Oktoberfest. However, they are not allowed on the deck or inside the lodge. They must be on a leash at all times.",en,web
"Raiders defensive end Derrick Burgess doesn't attend voluntary practices in the offseason. He skips the offseason conditioning program, the weightlifting sessions and all the team meetings.
So what did perfect-attendance quarterback JaMarcus Russell say the first time Burgess got within arm's reach at mandatory minicamp?
""Where you been?"" Russell wisecracked as Burgess peeled off a potential helmet-jarring sack.
Answer: Mississippi, of course. That's where Burgess spends all his NFL offseasons.
He's in Oakland this week for the annual mandatory minicamp, and through four practices in two days, it's as if Burgess has been here all along.
He rolled around Cornell Green, raced past Mario Henderson, and even broke through double-teams for stops in the backfield. He was completely unblocked on one play and was there the moment Russell turned around for a play-action rollout.
The morning practice ended Wednesday with Burgess getting by Henderson and tight end Zach Miller in time to grab Michael Bush by the back of the jersey and end the run play.
""Strolls in and he's getting to the quarterback,"" Miller said.
That's what Burgess does best, as evidenced by two Pro Bowl appearances and 35 sacks since joining the Raiders in 2005. It's no wonder the Raiders don't mind him skipping the voluntary work when most everyone else is expected to show.
Then again, it isn't like Burgess gives them a choice. He's not about to donate his personal time in the offseason. He prefers to train at his former college, Ole Miss.
""Spend time with my family and everything. Ain't none of my folks out here,"" he said. ""Get myself motivated either way, so ...""
That's the way it's going to be. Perhaps the Raiders don't complain about Burgess' offseason program because he doesn't complain about his in-season pay.
He's on Year 4 of a five-year, $17.5 million deal that was respectable when Burgess signed it. Now, he's the fourth-highest paid defensive lineman on his own team, behind Tommy Kelly, Gerard Warren and Terdell Sands.
They combined for 20 1/2 sacks since 2005, the same year Burgess set the Raiders single-season record with 16. His eight sacks were tied for the team lead last season with Chris Clemons - who landed a five-year, $18.5 million deal with the Eagles.
""Derrick has handled himself with great class,"" coach Lane Kiffin said. ""The fact (he's) not saying anything about it, just going to work, it's not an easy thing to do because there's a number of players making more than him.""
McFadden talks: Agent Ian Greengross, who represents No. 4 draft pick Darren McFadden, met with Raiders negotiator Marc Badain on Wednesday.
This marked the first face-to-face negotiations between the two sides, and the session was described as preliminary by several familiar with the talks.
Several members of the McFadden family, including Darren's father, Graylon, watched practice.
Briefly: Fullback Oren O'Neal sustained an undisclosed leg injury and left the morning practice. ... Wide receiver Arman Shields, drafted in the fifth round, has missed the first two days of minicamp with a hamstring injury. ... The minicamp ends with a single afternoon practice today.",en,web
"We’ve known for decades that CAI homeowner volunteers, community managers, and business partners work hard every day to ensure the well-being of their community associations. Over the past two years, we’ve also discovered that CAI members are dedicated to bettering the world around them.
During our 2018 Annual Conference and Exposition, CAI partnered with Clean the World, a global social enterprise focused on improving health through water, sanitation, and hygiene to help those in need. CAI volunteers assembled more than 500 hygiene kits to donate to D.C.-area homeless veterans. That volunteer effort followed on the heels of the 2017 Annual Conference and Exposition, when CAI members bagged 10,000 pounds of pet food for the PAL Humane Society in Las Vegas.
These two instances of giving back occurred while CAI members were enjoying our events, and we’re confident our members exhibit the same volunteerism on their own time and within their local areas. Given the very nature of community associations, it should come as no surprise that CAI members are acutely aware of the value of volunteerism.
1. Safeguard your self-interests. Protect your property values and maintain the quality of life in your community.
2. Correct a problem. Has your car been towed, or do you think maintenance has been neglected?
3. Be sociable. Meet your neighbors and make friends.
4. Give back. Repay a little of what’s been done for you.
5. Advance your career. Build your personal resume by including community volunteer service on it.
6. Have fun. Association work isn’t drudgery. It’s fun accomplishing good things with your neighbors.
7. Get educated. Learn how it’s done—we’ll train you.
8. Express yourself. Help with creative projects like community beautification.
9. Earn recognition. If you would like a little attention or validation, your contributions will be recognized and celebrated.
10. Try some altruism. Improve society by helping others.

"Investigating whether an incident opioid use is associated with an increased risk of hip fractures among community-dwelling persons.
A new study by the University of Eastern Finland shows that people using strong painkillers, opioids have double the risk of hip fracture contrasted with non-opioid users. This happens due to increased opioid strength.
Strong opioids, for example, buprenorphine, were associated with a double risk and strong opioids, like oxycodone and fentanyl, were associated with almost a three-fold risk, compared with non-use.
Opioids impact on the central nervous system and for this reason, opioid use may cause attentional impairment or drowsiness. They are also known for increasing the risk of falls that may lead to a hip fracture in older people.
For this study, 23,100 community-dwelling persons diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease in Finland during 2010-2011 were included. Scientists Compared incident opioid users (N = 4750) with opioid nonusers (N = 4750).
Data on drug use and hip fractures were retrieved from nationwide registers. Incident opioid users were identified with a 1-year washout. Cox proportional hazard models compared the risk of hip fracture between opioid use and nonuse and were weighted with inverse probability of treatment (IPT), based on a propensity score.
The results suggest an increase in the risk of hip fracture by increasing opioid strength; weak opioids IPT-weighted HR 1.75 (0.91-3.35), buprenorphine IPT-weighted HR 2.10 (1.41-3.13), and strong opioids IPT-weighted HR 2.89 (1.32-6.32).
The study is published in the journal PAIN.",en,academic
"Top 10 men’s fashion trendsetters of all time!
From movie stars to footballers, there are many who have stood out from the crowd as true fashion icons.
Here are our top picks of the trendsetters of all-time in the world of fashion; accounting for their impact on the industry owing to their iconic style.
The Beatles were highly impactful in the world of fashion during their time, but John Lennon’s experimentation with colours, patterns and loud combinations will forever be remembered.
Cary Grant’s traditional style may be attributed to the decade, but his classic suits and dapper attire would be envied in today’s fashion – both classic and elegant.
George Clooney has been in the spotlight for decades. His classically cool style showcases his personality perfectly.
How could he not be on this list? Mr. Presley was known for his moves, his iconic stage uniform, and of course his fashion sense.
We recommend borrowing some inspiration from Elvis’s toned-down personal style.
Johnny Depp has taken things to the next level as we’ve watched him grow into a handsome man.
Depp has taught us all that the bad boy look doesn’t have to be hung up past your twenties. And, more importantly, don’t forget to accessorise!
Jimi Hendrix made a name for himself musically and within the realm of fashion.
Our list wouldn’t be complete without his colourful outfits.
Only for the most adventurous, Pharrell’s style is anything but classic.
Experimentation is certainly key to his stylish wardrobe, but even more importantly, he demonstrates that confidence is the key to selling your fashion choice.
Ryan Gosling may be talented on screen, but he has a star-worthy fashion sense as well as making us want to raid his closet!
Known for his rugged looks, James Dean popularised a classic look for men that’s stood the test of time - a crisp white t-shirt and jeans never looked so good.
In the 90s, all eyes were on David Beckham. Even now as his children try to outshine him, all eyes are still on Beckham today.
Have we missed someone out who you think deserves to be on this list? Let us know what you think!",en,web

"An extortionist has sent e-mails to several schools in Calgary, Canada, threatening to detonate explosives if they do not send bitcoin payments to a certain address.
Police have determined that the threats are not legitimate and classes will continue as normal. However, parents and students have been notified and police have increased their presence at the schools.
Police have not disclosed the names of the schools to the public.
A police spokesman said that similar threats have been made to other Canadian and American schools in the past. While the cases are not necessarily connected, Calgary police will be collaborating with their counterparts both north and south of the border.
Bitcoin has become a go-to tool for extortionists looking to reap their rewards without fear of getting hunted down by authorities. Threats can be made anonymously, and payments cannot be reversed or frozen by authorities.
Attackers have targeted a wide range of victims, including individuals, schools, municipalities and even police departments with varying degrees of success.",en,web
"Over the last few weeks I’ve been experimenting with the cnc mill of fablab Genk, making samples and trying out different stuff to expand the range of possibilities with the machine.
One of the things I’m working on is a definition where you could make a picture of some objects to create a box from it. What I want to do is to have grasshopper read the photo and turn it into the curves on right scale for cnc milling. I did a first basic test for defining and testing the idea, by drawing & scaling the curves from the contours manually in rhino.
Then I made a marker holder for writing with the cnc. Since the Colinbus CAMsoftware overrules the spindle speed to the maximum RPM when putting 0 in the gcode I had to make an external fixation. My first test with a basic marker didn’t work out properly, since my material wasn’t perfectly flat. The tip got pushed in on the heighest side, ensuring it didn’t write on the lower parts.
So I did the same test with a marker you have to pump up, which worked out great. I also tried writing on fabric like from tshirts. It’s important to get the z-height perfect, which was the hard thing since there’s no automatic z-height-leveler.
I’ve also been making some texture samples for the sake of testing and showing the grasshopper postprocessor and its possibilities.
And finally I’m trying to learn and apply Python scripting in grasshopper for expanding my possibilities by following some tutorials.
It’s nice how your mind keeps going by making things yourself and by staying curious for new things to learn.",en,unknown

"Training dives were feeling good, but then when it was time to compete my favorite Handstand Dive, I overthought it too much and it came as one of my worst dive scores ever (bomba landing!!) which shoot me down from 4th place to 11th.
Not much to lose on my last one, so I tried to erase my mistake from my mind, and focus on my Front Twist Dive. I managed to put it down nicely, and climb a few positions up to 8th place.
Not the result I was aiming at, but happy to keep my 3rd overall, together with Gary Hunt: by the way, happy to see my buddy come back from his twist mental block and get a well deserved win in Sisikon!

"Today is Thanksgiving Day here in the United States. It is a day set aside to give thanks for the blessing bestowed on us. The tryptophan torpor, sport spectaculars and “Black Friday”, shopping planning are fairly modern side effects, though I would love to see the latter relegated to history’s trash can.
I have so much for which I am thankful despite how much 2012 has been awful. The most important blessing I am thankful for was my time with Lucy. I was so fortunate to be married to her for almost 24 years and our being together for 28 years. I will treasure that time for the remainder of my existence in this world.
I am very thankful for the love and support everyone has offered me. I am especially thankful for the special people who were there for me during the worst time in my life, who offered compassion and strength when I needed it most, and who helped start my healing process. Marilyn Monroe once said “But if you can’t handle me at my worst, then you sure as hell don’t deserve me at my best.” Thank you for putting up with me.
I am thankful for the people who are sacrificing a holiday to server others: soldiers, police, firefighters, health care professionals, volunteers. It is gratifying that you are putting others first.
This year I am thankful the weather is cooperating, at least until early afternoon. We set a record high of 60°F very early this morning (the old record was 59°F set in 1998 for the curious; the “pioneer” record high was 60°F set in 1867), but will see a sharp drop in temp with a strong northwest wind later. Those of you on the road today should keep an eye on the weather and stay safe. It’s time for me to get on the road. I’m heading to John’s for Thanksgiving. Mom and Dad are there and Jacob will be over this morning. Jim can’t break away from his business venture.
Enjoy time with your loved ones. Chris and Dave, enjoy your time volunteering. Be thankful for your family, friends, and loved ones.
Her home hospice care is getting set up today. She will be going home at 3:00 this afternoon. Lucy is tolerating her oral medications well. She slept about six hours last night. Her hospice nurse will meet us at home at 3:30.

The Athena cluster in the Student Center is being converted into a student study lounge, which will include sitting areas, rooms for group work, computing resources, printers, and open study spaces. This renovation is part of an ongoing effort to enhance and update spaces in the Student Center.
When the work is completed this spring, W20-575 will continue to provide technology resources, including 24x7 access to workstations and printers.
Relocated during the construction work, the Athena hardware is still available for use. Three workstations (two iMacs and one Dell desktop) and two black-and-white printers can be found in the Coffeehouse Lounge on the third floor (W20-308). The color printer has been moved to the first floor, near the two Athena Quickstations.
Athena workstations and printers can also be found in many other locations around campus. Buildings 1 and 56 house the largest collections of workstations on campus, in rooms 1-115 and 56-129, respectively. A complete list of Athena facilities at MIT can be found on the IS&T website.

"Local MSPs, Gillian Martin (Aberdeenshire East) and Mark McDonald (Aberdeen Donside) and MP, Alex Salmond (Gordon) have welcomed Scotland's Cabinet Secretary for the Economy, Job and Fair Work, Keith Brown MSP on a day-long investment tour of the North East.
This morning, Mr Brown visited Arjowiggins Creative Papers’ Stoneywood Mill industrial complex with Mr Salmond and Mr McDonald, Scotland’s last remaining paper mill. The company, which provides fine, security and industrial release paper, has been situated at their site in Stoneywood since 1770, employing almost 500 people in the local area. Mr Brown, Mr Salmond and Mr McDonald met with Angus MacSween (General Manager of Stoneywood Mill) and Managing Director, Jonathan Mitchell to discuss future investment opportunities.
From there, he travelled onto Brewdog's world headquarters in Ellon, where he met with Finance Director, Neil Simpson and Richard Street from Property and Legal Projects, to discuss the company’s exciting expansion plans in Aberdeenshire. The company, with 50,000 international shareholders currently employs 660 people world-wide, just 200 of them outside of Ellon, and are expected to expand that to 950 by the end of the year.
""It was great to be able to welcome Keith Brown to the Stoneywood Paper Mill, which is almost 250 years old, and allow him the opportunity to discuss the future investment plans at the site.
""Stoneywood Mill is a major employer in the North East economy with nearly 500 employees and an international reputation for the work that they do. It was good that the Cabinet Secretary was able to discuss the importance of the company to the local and national economy.""
“Everyone knows that Brewdog is a phenomenal company, less people know that they are one of the fastest growing drinks companies in the world. They here are constantly working on new innovative projects and the exciting thing for us is that they are centred here in Ellon.
""It was great to have the Cabinet Secretary along to visit Brewdog which lies in my constituency. They are a local success story who have shown how to take a local product and develop it into a global brand.
""They are a fantastic example of the opportunity in the food and drink industry in the North East and beyond. It is important we are able to provide Brewdog with the support they deserve to carry on expanding, delivering more jobs and investment in the region.""",en,web

"Major changes to the regulation of the asset management industry announced by the Securities and Futures Commission (“SFC”) last year have started to come into effect. The changes will affect managers of both private and public pooled investment funds as well as managers of segregated managed accounts. They will affect how investment funds are structured, operated and marketed, and also how asset managers will carry out their management functions. Although the SFC has characterized the changes as high-level principles-based “enhancements”, they include some specific prescriptive requirements in relation to matters such as custody arrangements, liquidity risk management controls, collateral valuation policies for securities lending, and disclosure of leverage.
The changes will be implemented through amendments to the Fund Manager Code of Conduct which will come into effect on November 17, 2018 as well as amendments to the Code of Conduct of Persons Licensed by or Registered with the SFC, some of which came into effect on August 17, 2018 and some of which will come into effect on November 25, 2018. Asset managers should who have not yet done so should conduct a review of their operations and fund documentation to ensure they will be able to comply.
Please join us for the lunch time seminar as we discuss these latest changes and the steps that may be necessary to accommodate them.

"Helmcken Falls first came into the spotlight in 2010 when Tim Emmett and Will Gadd climbed Spray On, grading it WI10. There had not yet been a WI8 or WI9. Since then it&apos;s been the place to go for boundary-pushing ice. The reason for this is the area&apos;s topography. Helmcken Falls itself doesn&apos;t freeze. Instead, wind blows water from the 460-foot flow into a cave behind it, where it freezes to the rock creating spray ice. The result is routes that are not just long, but extremely steep. Because the spray ice is unstable, and the rock behind it lacks cracks, all the routes here are protected with bolts.
In February 2016, Tim Emmett and Klemen Premrl pushed the boundaries at Helmcken once again, climbing a new 260-foot line that&apos;s about 100-feet overhung, and grading it WI12. The team used a custom 200-meter rope for the ascent.",en,reference
"As an attempt to make amends for the flubbed Assassin's Creed Unity launch, Ubisoft announced last month that it'd grant the Dead Kings story add-on for free to all Unity players. This put out the season pass owners, since they were now only receiving a portion of the content that they paid for up front. To rectify that situation, Ubisoft decided to give season pass owners a free game sometime in the near future.
Via an FAQ on the Unity site, Ubisoft's revealed that the gratis title offer will be live later this week. A dedicated site will launch, where players can enter their UPlay credentials to verify their eligibility. As stated in late November, the list of games to choose from is limited to Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag, Far Cry 4, Rayman Legends, Just Dance 2015, Watch Dogs and The Crew.
One caveat to the offer is that the free game must be for the same platform as the system that the season pass was registered on. Ubisoft also warns that anyone that redeemed the Assassin's Creed Unity season pass after November 25 may experience some delays in processing their free title.",en,web

"Moser did a little bit of performance art while still in school but really began afterwards when she attended an experimental comedy course in her residency at The Banff Centre. She now does performances both live and on video. She has performed at the Art Gallery of Ontario, Mercer Union, 8-11, Artspace, and Doored, as well as other galleries and at some universities.
Her performances are seemingly random scenes and clips taken out of different contexts, using different props, costumes, characters, and audio to signify a change in the story. Each performance has a different visual aesthetic, achieved through different props, costumes, and setting. Her performances involve various forms of audio, such as: voiceovers, ambient sounds, pop songs, and other sound effects. While performing, Moser interacts with objects using her body in different variations, permutations, and combinations. Moser will take an object that we associate with a certain action or use and subtly change the interaction between her body and the object, which subsequently and temporarily changes our relationship with the object.
Almost every performance stands on the boarder between absurd comedy and profound thought. Moser plays into the fact that comedy is typically seen as frivolous and disengaged with conceptual themes. Despite this generalized view, she sees comedy and conceptual art looking to achieve similar goals; taking an expectation or conventional idea, and turning it on it’s head.
Moser’s work ethic is based upon her trying to understand her interests and attraction to certain items or ideologies and the process she takes in trying to figure them out. For example, a topic that comes up a lot in her work is the idea of self-help. Moser finds this notion interesting as it has been made into a commercialized process that you can make yourself OK if you follow steps x, y, and z. She amplifies this in her performances, as she rehearses, she changes and rearranges scenes as she grapples with intriguing concepts, such as self-help.

"Many others are appalled and feel intense sympathy for those around me and particularly my family and friends.
But all of them think how exhausting and time consuming it must be to be constantly looking to negotiate a better deal in every relationship all of the time.
Truth of the matter is I don’t negotiate half as often as I could, but I do recognise the opportunity to do so if I liked.
Yesterday I spent four hours in a speed awareness course as a punishment for hitting 55 mph in a variable speed area on the M25. I thought that these variable limits were not enforceable (not true), and that speed cameras would be set to the national speed limit so would not recognise variances in real time (not true either, we live in the world of the smart motorway and cameras are reset to manage road situations at the time). Two myths debunked right there.
The critical part of the course, which was not as boring as you might think, was to get people to think about the implications of speeding on others as well as yourself and recognise or become aware of the problems that reckless driving can bring.
Whilst in Britain we are one of the safest countries on the planet to drive (we are consistently in the top 3 safest countries to drive with Sweden and Canada), still around 1,750 deaths a year occur on our roads. That’s 5 people a day.
Now I think most of us are aware that driving too fast is silly, better to be late in this life than early in the next. The issue is not awareness but action. What do we do with that awareness?
That is also true of many aspects of life. I am aware of the effects of too much drinking, of not taking enough exercise or eating processed food.
So it is with negotiation. I do not spend my life in coffee shops negotiating a better deal, or extolling the value of my business to the local newsagent.
What I do is recognise when negotiation is a possibility, I am aware of the process that underpins it and what I need in order to engage with the other side, or encourage them to demonstrate interest.
Rather like being in my car, I prefer the driving seat.",en,books
"The mudroom is unlike the front entrance, which is seen by everyone and used by guests; the mudroom is usually a secondary entrance. Personally, I would love one; even a small mudroom would be helpful for keeping the house picked up and organized.
Hooks and racks are a must! Coats, hats, scarves, umbrellas — whatever it may be, they all need a place. Currently, my kids think it’s the floor of the entryway; I’m not a fan.
A bench is next on the must-have mudroom list. The first thing you want to do when you get home is sit down and take your shoes off. A bench is a perfect place to do that, and it can also be used for shoe storage by putting a boot tray underneath the bench, or by using a bench with a flip-up seat for more storage space.
Cubbies or lockers will take your mudroom to the next level. Each member of your family can have their own designated storage space. Each cubby or locker should come with the essentials: low storage for the shoes, hooks for the coats and backpacks, and high storage for seasonal items like hats, gloves, and scarves.
A closet can also come in handy in your mudroom. It’s not an absolute must-have, but it would provide a designated space for out-of-season things, such as sports equipment, winter/spring essentials, cleaning supplies, or any other items you want out of sight.
Also useful in the mudroom would be a utility sink!! This is great for spring, when you’re gardening and need a quick place to clean up without tracking mud throughout your home. It’s also excellent for cleaning up paint and crafts, or a quick washing of clothes. You could even use it for bathing your pets.

That year, Allen's 269 associated with 653 three-point shots, picture 41. 2%, as Stephen -- 272 of 600 shots in his Arsenal, of up to 45. 3%; That year, Alan ball attack produce 3 ratio is a lot less than a quarter, compared along with 38. 6% in data bank; That year, Allen's assists the telephone number 3. 7, less than the Treasury for three assists. So the outline, the image of alternative 3-pointers hand lower the garage outline: he not only completed the sharpshooter qualifications, his teammates for his / her creation of free-throw prospects into; He will also look for opportunities as well, through the ball state-of-the-art, stopped for no helps 3-pointer of shots. Also, he also can complete assists, ""create"" another glass pitcher - clay - Thompson! Not merely can catch vote, may also urgent stopped, can build more opportunities to others, this star, unique!

"Which Ideas Are Ready To Go To Florida?
Recently, Edge.org posed it’s yearly question to a number of different thinkers who were given 1,000 words or less to provide their answer. This year, the topic was, “What scientific idea is ready for retirement?” and responses were received from about 175 people. This question appeared to come on heels of a quote by Max Planck, who suggested at one point that new ideas tend to gain their prominence not through actively convincing their opponents that they are correct, but rather when those who hold to alternative ideas die off themselves. Now Edge.org did not query my opinion on the matter (and the NBA has yet to draft me, for some unknowable reason), so I find myself relegated to the side-lines, engaging in the always-fun past time of lobbing criticisms at others. Though I did not read through all the responses – as many of them fall outside of my area of expertise and I’m already suffering from many demands for my time that are a bit more pressing – I did have some general reactions to some of the answers people provided to this question.
Sticks and stones can break their bones? Good enough for me.
The first reaction I had is with respect to the question itself. Planck was likely onto something when he noted that ideas are not necessarily accepted by others owing to their truth value. As I have discussed a few times before, there are, in my mind, anyway, some pretty compelling reasons for viewing human reasoning abilities as something other than truth-finders: first, people’s ability to successfully reason about a topic often hinges heavily on the domain in question. Whereas people are skilled reasoners when it comes to social contracts, they are poor at reasoning about more content-neutral domains. In that regard, there doesn’t seem to be a general-purpose reasoning mechanism that works equally well in all scenarios. Second, people’s judgements of their performance on tasks of reasoning abilities are often relatively uncorrelated with their actual performance. Most people appear to rate their performance in line with how easy or difficult a task felt, and, in some cases, being wrong happens to feel a lot like being right. Third, people are often found to ignore or find fault with evidence that doesn’t support their view, but will often accept evidence that does fit with their beliefs much less critically. Importantly, this seems to hold when the relative quality of the evidence in question is held constant. Having a WEIRD sample might be a problem for a study that reaches a conclusion unpalatable to the person assessing it, but is unlikely to be mentioned if the results are more agreeable.
Finally, there are good theoretical reasons for thinking that reasoning can be better understood by positing that it functions to persuade others, rather than to seek truth per se. This owes itself to the fact that being right is not necessarily always the most useful thing to be. If I’m not actually going to end up being successful in the future, for instance, it still might pay for me to try and convince other people that my prospects are actually pretty good so they won’t abandon me like the poor investment I am. Similarly, if I happen to advocate a particular theory that most of my career is built upon, abandoning that idea because it’s wrong could mean doing severe damage to my reputation and job prospects. In other words, there are certain ways that people can capture benefits in the social world by convincing others of untrue things. While that’s all well and good, it would seem to frame the Edge question is a very peculiar light: we might expect that people – those who responded to the Edge’s question included – tend to advocate that certain ideas should be relinquished, but their motivations and reasons (conscious or otherwise) for making that suggestion are based in many things which are not the idea’s truth value. As the old quote about evolution goes, “Let’s hope it is not true. But if it is true, let’s pray that it doesn’t become widely known”.
As an example, let’s consider the reply from Matt Ridley, who suggests that Malthus’ ideas on population growth were wrong. The basic idea that Malthus had was that resources are finite, and that populations, if unchecked, would continue to grow to the point that people would eventually live pretty unhappy lives, owing to the scarcity of resources relative to the size of the population. There would be more mouths wanting food than available food, which is a pretty unsatisfactory way to live life. Matt states, in his words, that “Malthus and his followers were wrong, wrong, wrong”. Human ingenuity has helped come to the rescue, and people have been becoming better and better at using the available resources in more efficient manners. The human population has continued to grow, often unchecked by famine (at least not in most first world nations). If anything, many people have access to too much food, leading to wide-spread obesity. While all this is true enough, and Malthus appeared to be wrong with respect to certain specifics, one would be hard-pressed to say that the basic insights themselves are worthy of retirement. For starters, human population growth has often come at the expense of many other species, plant and animal alike; we’ve made more room for ourselves not just by getting better at using what resources we do have, but by ensuring other species can’t use them either.
As it turns out, dead things are pretty poor competition for us.
Not only has our expansion has come at the expense of other species that find themselves suddenly faced with a variety of scarcities, but there’s also no denying that population growth will, at some point, be checked by resource availability. Given that humans are discovering new ways of doing things more efficiently than we used to, we might not have hit that point yet and we might not hit it for some time. It does not follow, however, that such a point does not, at least in principle, exist. While there is no theoretical upper limit on the number of people which might exist, the ability of human ingenuity to continuously improve the ability of our planet to support all those people is by no means a guarantee. While technology has improved markedly since the time of Malthus, there’s no telling how long such improvements will be sustained. Perhaps technology could continue to improve infinitely, just as populations can grow if unconstrained, but I wouldn’t bet on it. While Malthus might have been wrong about some details, I would hesitate to find his underlying ideas a home on a golf course close to the beach.
Another reply which stood out to me came from Martin Nowak. I have been critical of his ideas about group selection before, and I’m equally as critical of his answer to the Edge question. Nowak wants to prematurely retire the 50 year old idea of inclusive fitness: the idea that genes can benefit themselves by benefiting various bodies that contain copies of them, discounted by the probability of their being in that other body. Nowak seems to want to retire the concept for two primary reasons: first, he suggests it’s mathematically inelegant. In the process of doing so, Nowak appears to insinuate that inclusive fitness represents some special kind of calculation that is both (a) mathematically impossible and (b) identical to calculations derived from standard evolutionary fitness calculations. On this account, Nowak seems to be confused: if the inclusive fitness calculations lead to the same outcome as standard fitness calculations, then there’s either something impossible about standard evolutionary theory (there isn’t), or inclusive fitness isn’t some special kind of calculation (it isn’t).
Charitable guy that Nowak is he does mention that the inclusive fitness approach has generated a vast literature of theoretically and empirically useful findings. Again, this seems strange if we’re going to take him at his word that the idea obviously wrong and one that should be retired. If it’s still doing useful work, retirement seems premature. Nowak doesn’t stop there, though: he claims that no one has empirically tested inclusive fitness theory because researchers haven’t been making precise fitness calculations in wild populations.This latter criticism is odd on a number of fronts. First, it seems to misunderstand the type of evidence that evolutionary researchers look for, which is evidence of special design; counting offspring directly is often not terribly useful in that regard. The second issue I see with that suggestion is that, perhaps ironically, Nowak’s favored alternative – group selection – has yet to make a single empirical prediction that could not also be made by an inclusive fitness approach (though inclusive fitness theorizing has successfully generated and supported many predictions which group selection cannot readily explain). Of all of Nowak’s work I have come across, I haven’t found an empirical test in any of his papers. Perhaps they exist, but if he is so sure that inclusive fitness theory doesn’t work (or is identical to other methods), then demonstrating so empirically should be a cake walk for him. I’ll eagerly await his research on that front.
While this only scratches the surface of the responses to the question, I would caution against retiring many of the ideas that were singled out in the answer section. Just as a general rule, ideas in science should be retired, in my mind, when they can be demonstrated without (much of) a doubt to be wrong and to seriously lead people astray in their thinking. Even then, it might only require us to retire an underlying assumption, rather than the core of the idea itself. Saying that we should retire inclusive fitness “because no one ever really tested it as I would like” is a poor reason for retirement; retiring the ideas of Malthus because we aren’t starving in the streets at the moment also seems premature. Instead of talking about what ideas should be retired wholesale, a better question would be to consider, “what evidence would convince you that you’re mistaken, and why would that evidence do so?” Questions like that not only help ferret out problematic assumption, but they might also help make useful forward momentum empirically and theoretically. Maybe the Edge could consider some variant of that question for next year.",en,reference
"A prominent evolutionist, Richard Lewinton, once said: ""We take the side of science in spite of the patent absurdity of some of its constructs... Moreover, that materialism is absolute, for we cannot allow a Divine Foot in the door.""
Despite the fact that you can't get truth from evolution, nowadays in western society the idea of evolution and 'millions of years' is widely accepted as being true and is assumed to be the correct explanation of how we came to be. It's not just something that is being taught in schools and universities either. It's everywhere - on TV, in movies, on the news, at museums, zoos, aquariums, and sight-seeing tours. The idea that the earth has been around for billions of years and that dinosaurs lived millions of years ago before man is often presented as fact - not just by scientists, but by the media in general. It has been said that if a lie is repeated often enough people will come to believe it is true - and this is what has happened in most of western culture today.
Even many Christians have been indoctrinated by this idea and have come to reject the clear teaching of scripture - that we were created by God thousands of years ago (not millions of years ago), and that God made a mature creation that was fully formed. The Bible tells us in Genesis 1 that all creatures were made by God to reproduce after their kind - which is what we see in the real world - we see adaptation but with clear limitations. What we don't see is animals changing from one species into another totally different animal as evolution would have us believe.
Evolution and Millions of Years - It's Not Science!
The above 2 pictures are from the article ""It's not science"". In the article they show why the creation vs evolution debate is not fundamentally about science - it's about worldviews and presuppositions. Real science is about doing repeated experiments in the present - but you can't do a repeated experiment on something that happened in the distant past and that was a one time event.
Note too that when I talk about evolution here I'm not talking about variation in species, but changes in species where over long periods of time we evolved from goo to you by way of the zoo. Often evolutionists dishonestly switch those two concepts as can be seen in the cartoon on the above left.
If you start with the presupposition that there is no God or that a miraculous 6 day creation did not happen - then no matter what evidence you look at you can never come to the conclusion that a miraculous 6 day creation best fits the evidence. All evidence is always interpreted in the light of ones presuppositions.
If God made a mature creation and 'young' earth, how could we ever know this from science, given the fact that science assumes miracles don't happen?
If Adam and Eve were the equivalent of 20 years old when God made them - how old would they have been one year after God made them?

Astigmatism or Farsightedness - When the lasers for LASIK were first approved the FDA only allowed us to treat patients without astigmatism or farsightedness. With current laser technology LASIK is very precise at correcting this problem. These patients can have excellent vision, in fact studies show even better vision than glasses.
Thin Corneas - The cornea is the curved surface on the front of the eye and if it is too thin a patient cannot have LASIK. This is the beauty of the Visian ICL. It does not have any effect on the cornea and is an excellent choice if you have thin corneas. .
Dry Eyes - One of the advantages of the Visian ICL is that it will not cause or contribute to dry eyes. For patients in Arizona this can be very important. .
High Refractive Error - The advantage of the Visian ICL is that it has an even greater capacity to correct vision. Anyone seeking clear vision may be a candidate for the Visian ICL, including patients with extreme or special vision correction needs. .

"Not only is the number of 85 year olds set to double in the next 20 years, but the average life expectancy beyond retirement age is also increasing rapidly.
Property is a cyclical business, and the market is currently looking healthy. With low (albeit rising) inflation and low interest rates, investors across the globe are looking at property assets with good rental prospects as a safe place to invest. None of us have a crystal ball, and we are neither a prophet nor the son of a prophet but we believe that there is always the need to get back to the fundamentals of any particular investment proposition.
Healthcare as part of the ""alternatives"" asset class is attracting interest from institutional and retail investors alike. The UK's elderly care sector in particular is seeing an increased level of investment activity, benefiting from the favourable underlying population dynamics which are driving demand in the sector. Not only is the number of 85 year olds set to double in the next 20 years, but the average life expectancy beyond retirement age is also increasing rapidly. Approximately 15% of over 85 year olds are expected to make use of residential care in some form and to meet this demand the UK's ageing care home stock requires to be substantially upgraded and new facilities built.
As in any service-led sector, there is the potential for reputational issues as a result of poor provision of care which investors must seek to insulate themselves from. The lessons first expressed by Florence Nightingale in the 19th century about ensuring high standards of care, both clinical and social, still hold true today. It is essential that underlying care fundamentals are strong in all circumstances, and flowing from this then financial performance typically follows.
Target Healthcare REIT continues to invest around the country, always based on localisation fundamentals. Effectively all care home businesses operate within local discreet markets, as families wish to have the relative close to hand and easy to visit. National brand is less important, as a family only makes a single purchase of care in its life cycle, so families are always looking for best in class affordable local care, according to personal circumstances, close to their homes. When buying assets, close attention needs to be paid to setting an affordable and sustainable rent based on local fee levels and expected occupancy levels, and taking into account future demand, both for numbers of residents and future new builds, price points and labour availability.
The care ethos and focus of owners, managers and carers is an important consideration, and assessing span of control is a very important part of the investment decision. Larger operators try to develop systems and processes to enable area managers to operate multiple numbers of homes, but Target prefers to see a strong personal and relational element to the management of care homes. This is a people business that needs best in class care facilities. But good rents flow from well run and managed facilities, which become homes not institutions.
Approximately 15% of over 85 year olds are expected to make use of residential care in some form and to meet this demand the UK's ageing care home stock requires a substantial upgraded.

"Gracie Fields was born in Rochdale, Lancashire, England and died on her beloved island of Capri. She was a great favourite during the inter-war years with comic songs such as “Stop, shop at the Co-op shop,”(1929), “The Rochdale hounds” (1932), “Walter, Walter lead me to the altar,” “The biggest aspidistra in the world,” “She fought like a tiger (for ‘er ‘onour,)” all presented in a Northern, working-class style. She was also a great success between 1931 & 1945 appearing in films such as “This week of grace” (1933), “Sing as we go” (1934), “Look up and laugh”1935, “We’re going to be rich” 1938 and “Shipyard Sally” (1939). Her most famous song was “Sally” which became her theme song. Sheet music for “Goodnight children everywhere” at the outbreak of world war two carried the message “with a tender thought to all evacuated children” and during the war she worked for ENSA entertaining the troops.

"Dearie me, it has been so long sine I did a post. I have lots of ideas but I’ve had a rough few days and not much energy for work or anything. I have a history of chronic headaches and migraines that I am working on improving, but some dental treatment last week has led to a week of headaches.
The first week in the new house was great. All the unpacking is done and everything seems to be working out really well. We’ve had issues with our internet provider and are switching in the next couple of weeks and I have seen a couple more spiders than I would like (resulting in some scary dreams!) but overall the move has gone very smoothly and the Boyo and I are very happy with our new location.
It was fun and thankfully the weather was pleasant, getting lost and having to navigate bushes, bogs and burns in the rain would not have been so much fun. I was quite impressed with the park – looked like there was a lot to do so we’ll be back at some point. Kirkcaldy is only 20 minutes from our new house so it is a convenient place to go if I need to nip to some bigger shops (eg boots, M&S) that our new rural locality doesn’t offer.
I also got my hair chopped (very expensive getting colour re-done but now back to natural hair colour with highlghts, hooray) and a very quick (5 minutes!) wander around Fife Farmers Market – enough time to get some Isle of Arran Cracked Black Peppercorn Cheese (so good) and some lavender syrup and lavender sugar for experimentation in the kitchen. An update on these experiments will follow shortly.
Would LikesI thought I’d have a little look online at some of the shops I often buy from to see if there was anything I’d like. I am going on holiday next month to Hong Kong and throughout the summer months my workwear policy is relaxed but I usually try to stick to smart casual. I am unlikely to actually go and buy any of these things before the holiday as I’d like to save my pennies for Hong Kong. I bought a pair of navy chino shorts, a new white vest top and another coral top and that will have to do in next. I am wearing the coral top for a fourth time today so it is already a success. I have a lot of wonderful clothes but I don’t fit into many of them at the moment so finding a complete selection of holiday clothes without buying anything else will be a challenge but if I keep buying clothes that are bigger I’ll never lose the pesky weight that I need to lose in order to fit into my pretty dresses again and improve my health.
Marks & Spencers – M&S dresses can sometimes be great, sometimes not, this is mostly due to my size. Slightly on the bigger up top and tall means that dresses often are not quite proportioned right for my body but the following are definitely ones that I would like to try on!
I really like this dress, it is a real classic that could be worn throughout the year for various things.
This may be one that I’ll end up trying on after holiday time. I can just see it being very useful.
BHS – I hadn’t been in a BHS in years but over the last year I’ve managed to pick up a few dresses for work in there. A black dress with cobalt blue and white polka dots has been my most frequently worn item of clothing over the last few months (http://www.bhs.co.uk/en/bhuk/product/women-1020590/dresses-1020593/chiffon-belted-dress-2522736?bi=201&ps=200 ). I also think BHS do fantastic tights. Marks & Spencers used to be the best but then they seemed to adjust their sizes and in order to find tights long enough for my lanky legs I have to get them way too big and they just seemed to ladder so easily. BHS are cheaper, their tights are long enough (hooray) and I think that they are fairly good quality. My winter black ones have lasted 3 years and I wear skirts and dresses and therefore tights nearly everyday for work.
Now onto Debenhams and some skirts. Generally I prefer my skirts to be sort of A-line and on or just above the knee. I have a couple of longer and midi skirts which I am experimenting with as although I’ve got the height my librarian-y fashion tendencies (I am actually a librarian not just stereotyping) mean that if I am not careful I can look a bit frumpy. Or mad. Or both.
Ok Shoes…. I have shoes from all sorts of places. My feet have been the same size since I was 16 so I have some fairly old pairs of shoes as well as some new. I have skinny feet whereas the rest of me is not skinny and I also have dodgy knees. This means I tend to go for shoes with straps and low heels. I already have my sandals looked out for the summer – a black low wedge pair from Clarks – no idea how old, a gold strappy pair of flats from New Look and another green pair I got for a wedding couple of years ago that are nearly but not quite flat. I also have several pairs of pumps that fit my special insoles for those dodgy knees, these have been bought over the years in M&S, Clarks, New Look, and just wherever I find them, very rarely do I ever find shoes in TK Maxx or H&M – they just do not really go big enough. The low heels I wear for work mostly come from M&S and Monsoon. And I have 3 pairs of espadrilles in sunny coral, useful black and green because I like green things. I like most colours really. I’m not picky where I get my shoes from, just that they are comfy and practical and usually are colourful – shoes are a great way to finish off an outfit. My sister says that they don’t finish an outfit, that they start an outfit. So when choosing what she will wear she always thinks about the shoes that she would like to wear that day first.
Okay I think that is probably quite enough. I’m now very tempted and everyone reading this is probably bored! What do you plan on wearing this summer? Any fabulous holiday plans?",en,web

"I need a little bit of coding help. I am trying to create several different widgets that will be packaged along with a series of themes I am developing. Seems simple enough right? I have found examples of other peoples widgets and have been able to activate them but they seem to override each other. Any help or input will be greatly appreciated!
We just put the widget code into the theme's function.php file.
Most of the example that you;re probably looking at are actually replacements of the core widgets with their own custom ones. Usually this is done if the html code used conflicts with the layout or code already in the theme. Widgets that display lists like the Page widget is a good example of this.
*sigh* Lost another post to the timeout monster.
Someone else is going to have to look at this as I'm not up on using classes.
have found examples of other peoples widgets and have been able to activate them but they seem to override each other.
Not sure what you mean, unless you are repeatedly re-initialising the plugins with the same names.
line 33 gives the widget a name, in this case ""adlitewidget"", line 35 is a function with the same name as the class ""adlitewidget"" and is the initialisation function.
You'll notice the same name ""adlitewidget"" multiple times in lines 44,45,46 this is to tell the widget internally what it is called - i like to keep all these things the same so it's easy to keep track. Each different widget should have a different name (line 33) and thus different values in 35, 44, 45 and 46.
Finally line 258 registers the widget, same text again in that function call.

"WHAT ARE THE ADVANTAGES OF Arduino Uno R3 OVER Arduino Duemilanove IN AUTONOMOUS ROBOT FOR CONTROLLING RC SERVO MOTORS.
COMPANY STILL SELLING Duemilanove ?
Probably none, in real terms. The Uno is the current 'standard' model of Arduino, and R3 is the current interation of it.
BTW, there is no need to shout.
Not entirely... there are still plenty of Duimilinova's out there, in stock. (Still see plenty on EBay) no sense in tossing them out, just because there's the new UNO, unless the UNO gives drastic improvement to the design of a project.
Not saying there is no need to go with the UNO, but if the Duimilinova will do the job, why overlook it?
The main differences between the UNO and the Duemilanove are the USB to Serial interface. The Duemilanove uses an FT232 which only has the capability of turning your USB port on your computer into a serial port that is capable of talking to the Atmega328 (Arduino processor). The UNO replaces the FT232 with an actual microprocessor that has a real USB interface. The ""stock"" firmware on this processor make it act similar to the the FT232. It makes your USB port on your computer a serial port.
Now that you know the UNO has this microprocessor instead of a FT232 you may wonder why. The microprocessor has the capability to be reprogrammed and can change functions. Maybe you don't want it to be a USB->Serial adapter. You can program it to make the computer to think it is a keyboard, a mouse, or any other USB device. You can even use it as a second Arduino like device to offload processing from the main Arduino processor.
From what I have heard (do some research to verify this) the R3 has upgraded the USB microprocessor for one with more flash. It also has some extra shield pins to possibly prepare it for future shields that run or can't run on 3.3V I/O.
So how may all this concern your Autonomous Robot? Well that all depends on what you want to do. If you plan on having an onboard computer that need to interface to the USB of the Arduino for some reason other than serial data. You would want an Uno. If you need extra procession power and you want to take advantage of the extra processor on the Uno, than you want an Uno. If you don't have an Arduino, get an Uno R3 if you are looking for a Genuine Arduino. No reason to get an older model. If you don't think you will need those extra capabilities and also don't want a Genuine Arduino, take a look at all the Arduino derivatives that exist. You may find something that fits your needs better. Maybe something with built-in motor controllers or additional PWM outputs.
The UNO replaces the FT232 with an actual microprocessor that has a real USB interface.
It also requires a USB driver which appears at times to have issues that the FTDI driver doesn't.",en,reference

The Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) is a multi-campus public funded research university in Mumbai, India. TISS is Asia's oldest institute for professional social work education and was founded in 1936 in then Bombay Presidency of British India as the Sir Dorabji Tata Graduate School of Social Work by the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust. In 1944, the institute was officially renamed as the Tata Institute of Social Sciences and in 1964, the Government of India declared TISS as Deemed university under Section 3 of the University Grants Commission Act (UGC), 1956.
In 1954 TISS moved to a permanent campus in Deonar, Mumbai of 10 acres (4 ha) now known as the Main Campus, from the earlier campuses in Nagpada and then Andheri. In 2001, the Deonar campus was expanded to include the Malti Jal and Jal A.D. Naoroji Campus Annexe, now commonly known as the New Campus. TISS in 1986 established a rural campus in Tuljapur, Maharashtra and two off-campuses in Guwahati and Hyderabad in 2011. In addition to these campuses, TISS offers teaching and training, research and development support from centres established across India including in Leh Ladakh and Port Blair, Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
TISS's academic programs focus on the Social Sciences and offers doctoral degrees in Management and Labour Studies, Disaster Studies, Development Studies, Education, Gender Studies, Health Studies, Law, Media and Cultural Studies, Public Policy, Rural Development and Social Work. Since its inception TISS has had a focus on field action including in responding to disasters such as the Partition of India, the Bhopal disaster and Uttarakhand floods. Several TISS initiatives have shaped public policy in India, such as India's labour welfare laws. Notable organizations and personalities have been appreciative of TISS's social service work including Eleanor Roosevelt, Jawaharlal Nehru, Niels Bohr and the United Nations, among others.
TISS was established in 1936, as the Sir Dorabji Tata Graduate School of Social Work, the first school of social work in India. It was renamed to its current name in 1944. It was recognised as a Deemed University in 1964  by the University Grants Commission of India. TISS started out as a small institute offering a post-graduate diploma in Social Work, but has since expanded continuously in terms of educational programmes and infrastructure (see list of programs). The first director of the institute was Clifford Manshardt, who aimed to establish a post-graduate social work school of national stature that would engage in a continuous study of Indian social issues and create meaningful interventions.
Over the years, the Institute has, among other thrusts, made a significant contribution to policy, planning, action strategies and human resource development. It has done so in several areas, ranging from sustainable rural and urban development to education, health, communal harmony, human rights and industrial relations. TISS has earned recognition as an institution of repute from different Ministries of the Government of India and various State Governments, as well as international agencies such as the United Nations, and the non-government sector, both national and international.
London School of Economics and Political Science research collaboration, was launched at LSE in June 2007. The programme is undertaken in two streams, namely, Social Sciences and Health. The research themes developed in Social Sciences have been in various Centres and Departments at LSE together with TISS such as Business Model Innovation at the Base of the Pyramid, Civil Society and Global Governance, Colonialism and Welfare: Social Policy and the British Imperial Legacy, Democracy and Development, Governance and the Governed, Population and Development, Social Protection, Economic Growth and Social Change, and Urban Planning & Development.
There are four campuses of TISS, located in Mumbai, Tuljapur, Hyderabad and Guwahati.
TISS was established in 1936 as Sir Dorabji Tata Graduate School of Social Work in Mumbai. It was renamed to its current name Tata Institute of Social Sciences in 1944. TISS Mumbai is the main campus of the TISS. In the year 1964, it was declared Deemed to be a University under Section 3 of the University Grants Commission Act (UGC), 1956. TISS Mumbai provides various M.A., M.Phil & Ph.D programs. Over the years, TISS Mumbai is well known for its contribution through research in social work, social sciences, human resources management & health systems.
In 2014, TISS introduced the Secular Ethics for Higher Education credit course in Mumbai. The inauguration was attended by the Dalai Lama, who was reported to have stated that, ""Since women have been shown to be more sensitive to others’ suffering, their leadership may be more effective. His Holiness suggested it's time for men to withdraw and for women to step forward.""
TISS Tuljapur in Osmanabad district of Maharashtra was set up with support from the Government of Maharashtra in 1986. The campus houses the School of Rural Development with several centres. It is a 100-acre campus located in the outskirts of Tuljapur. The campus has commenced offering the Five Year Integrated Masters programme since 2012. It has a computer centre, library, gymnasium, girls and boys hostels, guest house, faculty and staff quarters.
The initial focus of the Institute on rural development projects and field action has widened to include academic activities with grass root level involvement both by faculty and students in the last 7 years.
TISS Tuljapur offers bachelor's (one of the few in the country to offer a liberal arts course) and master's level courses in Social Sciences, Social Work Rural Development, Development Policy, Planning & Practices, Social Innovation and Entrepreneurship, Sustainable Livelihoods, Natural Resources Management And Governance.
TISS Hyderabad came into being with the approval of Academic Council and Governing Board of TISS.

TISS Guwahati has been set up at the behest of the government of Assam and the Ministry of Department of North East Region, Government of India. TISS Guwahati has been contributing to the development sector in the North East through a well-conceived Diploma Programme in Community Organisation and Development Practice since June 2009. Currently, TISS Guwahati is operating out of an interim campus in the heart of the city in Guwahati.
TISS Guwahati has commenced offering the Five Year Integrated Masters programme since 2012 along with two years master's degree programme in Social Work and Ecology, Environment and Sustainable Development. Several new academic programmes are being offered beyond the existing programmes from the academic year 2014–15.
The campus space is equipped with a cyber library, conference hall, and classrooms with provisions for video conferencing. Student hostels separately for men and women are available. These are managed and maintained by TISS. A full-fledged campus is being established on 15 acres of land located within the Assam Engineering College campus.
The institute has a governing board nominated by the Government of India, Government of Maharashta, the University of Mumbai and the University Grants Commission along with representatives from the institute faculty. S. Ramadorai, vice chairman, TCS and Advisor to the Prime Minister of India, is the current honorary chairperson of TISS. The chairperson of the governing board has functions similar to that of the chancellor of a conventional university. The academic council decides matters of academic nature and comprises faculty drawn from the institute's 4 campuses and as well as 6 external experts.
The director of the institute acts as both the academic and administrative head. This position is similar to that of the vice-chancellor of any university. S. Parasuraman retired as director. As of February 2018, Dr. Shalini Bharat serves as Director.

"You use technology to make things easier, right? Like, now you can watch tv on the bus and order pizza without ever talking to a human being. It’s pretty awesome. So why not apply that idea to hiring? Too many startups still see hiring as a waste of their precious time and energy – and that’s largely down to the way they manage it.
Using recruitment technology to smooth out the hiring process makes it easier for you, and hopefully less painful for your candidates too. In this market, where many companies – particularly startups and small businesses – struggle to find the right people, that’s crucial.
Here are a few basic, easy ways to create a more streamlined hiring and onboarding process.
Finding people can take forever. Technology can help of course. Job board and recruitment sites – like Seek and Trademe Jobs – are a good place to find people. Don’t ignore social recruiting through sites like LinkedIn, Twitter and Facebook, or specialist platforms like StackOverflow (for developers) or Behance (for designers).
This is one of those times where technology is a double edged sword – it means you have access to thousands of people through the internet, but it also means you have to sift through those thousands to find the right ones for you. Thats where the next point comes into its own.
Screening candidates pre-interview saves you time – but only if your screening process is designed to find people with the skills and talents your startup needs. If you rely on looking through a pile of CVs, you’re could miss the perfect person.
Using a pre-screening survey – like Weirdly – cuts out the old school CV process altogether. With a Weirdly quiz, candidates answer some quick (but revealing) questions, tell you a bit about themselves, and get an idea of what your brand stands for at the same time.
If you’ve screened candidates for cultural fit using a tool like Weirdly, interviews should be a chance for you and your candidate to get to know each other better, rather than a chance to grill them about their biggest weakness (it’s always perfectionism anyway).
Technology comes into play if you need to interview remotely, via Skype or conference call. You can also use a digital interview form (or just the notes function in Weirdly) to quickly record a candidates’ answers and your impressions, and share them with your wider team.
If you’re lucky, you’ll interview a bunch of people and find it hard to choose just one. This is when testing and assessment comes in. This used to be a slow, tedious process which required HR to pore over tests written on paper. Now, of course, the process can be quick and entirely paper-free. People can take personality, skill and even behavioural tests online or in your office. The software compiles results instantly, so you can see the stand out candidates at a glance. Tests4Geeks and Skillmeter are two options for testing technical or developer skills in your applicants.
Even if everything seems above board, it’s a good idea to do background and reference checks for your candidates. It’s a bit faster these days, with companies like Verify.co.nz offering online checking of criminal history, qualifications, Visa entitlements, and even credit history. They’ll even call references for you.
So you’ve found a candidate with the right cultural fit (and skill set). And they’ve decided to work for you. Hurrah! The next step is getting the paperwork sorted. Plenty of companies still use paper-heavy onboarding processes guaranteed to bore your shiny new hire to tears.
Putting it online doesn’t make the form filling more entertaining, necessarily, but it does make it faster. You can include a digital signature so everything is legal, and link to your intranet and any internal social networks, so they can start getting to know their colleagues.
Finally, your newbie actually has to learn to do the job. Training videos can be unintentionally hilarious, but they’re not usually very useful.
Taking people through an induction online isn’t just easier – it’s more engaging. With a virtual training portal, people can work through videos or quizzes at their own speed. You can also track their work. This means you’ll be able to see when they complete each training module, rather than handing over a dusty folder and hoping they read at least some of it.
A really easy, free place to start with this is Trello. Setting up your induction steps as cards, new team members can systematically work through the things they need to get set up and learn the ropes.
Want to make your hiring process less painful for everyone involved? Weirdly is a good place to start. You get a free trial and it only takes 30 seconds to set up – how’s that for simple?",en,web

"In this new series for the LEO blog, we go behind the scenes to feature a different member of the LEO team each month to find out more about the details of their role, what they contribute to the LEO brand, and, more generally, what makes them tick.
First up is Laura Tudor, LEO’s Director of Customer Service, on customer compliments, day-to-day duties, and her personal portfolio favourites.
Firstly, do introduce yourself! What is your background, and how did you come to your role at LEO?
I have worked at LEO for 11 years, starting in a junior role at 17 Cavendish Square in 2004. I have progressed through six roles in six buildings during my time at LEO, including General Manager, Dual Centre Manager and Area General Manager, before working up to my current role as Director of Customer Service.
What does the day-to-day of your job involve?
My current position is a dual role as Director of Customer Service, which includes continuing to be General Manager and Area General Manager of 45 Pont Street and 65 Sloane Street. The dual aspect of the role ensures that I still have day to day contact with customers, so as well as formulating LEO’s customer service strategy I also ensure it is delivered at centre level. The ‘hands on’ aspect of my role is something that, to this day, I very much enjoy.
My role as Director of Customer Service involves managing a team of five. This comprises four customer service cover personnel who are available to cover staff absence from around the business, ensuring that an exceptional level of customer service is maintained throughout the portfolio whatever the day-to-day challenges may be. The customer services team also includes a Deputy Director. Together the team and I audit all buildings within the portfolio every six months, as well as gather monthly feedback and complete follow-up appointments to ensure improvements are made consistently. The auditing of centres is continuous and integral to maintaining LEO’s exceptionally high standards.
Training is key to providing LEO’s peerless five star service. The customer service team has also developed a customer service training programme which all LEO staff, including new starters, are required to complete.
What services do you offer LEO clients as part of your customer service package, and which do you personally think is the most valuable?
Exceeding expectations with unbranded, impressive and beautifully maintained buildings, partnered with unsurpassable customer and support services – this is our trademark. We pay strong attention to detail in order to provide optimum working environments for all our clients – serviced office, virtual office or meeting and conferencing. Additionally, we particularly focus on ensuring our communal areas provide added value to our customers, with meeting facilities and lounge spaces that reflect the design and atmosphere of the building as well as the high quality of our service. Aside from this, LEO have a market leading offering in IT services, on which all our customers place a great emphasis. Both dedicated and building-wide Wi-Fi, free local and national calls and 5MB dedicated bandwidth are all included as standard within our office packages.
What do you feel LEO can offer clients that is truly unique and sets you apart from other luxury serviced office providers in London?
I understand LEO is the only provider of luxury serviced offices in London with a dedicated customer service department. Customer service is very much the cornerstone of our company culture, with a great emphasis on staff being trained to the highest standards. Our customers, who include large blue-chip organisations, financial institutions, ultra-high net worth family offices and SME companies across a range of sectors, agree with this, citing LEO as the best service office solution. In addition to our first-class customer service, this rationale can be attributed to LEO’s prestigious office addresses, highest quality furnishings and fittings, best-in-class IT and telephony offering, and the white-label nature of our products and services.
How do you feel LEO’s exemplary customer service is reflected in the satisfaction of your clients? Any glowing reviews or statistics which demonstrate this?
One metric which really demonstrates our levels of customer satisfaction is average length of stay. LEO’s average length of stay is industry leading, with the average being between 25 and 41 months; the industry average is 18-24. Many of our customers stay with us for years, some for more than a decade. Many customers come for the landmark locations of LEO’s luxury serviced offices, and stay for the service they receive. LEO allows businesses the flexibility to grow within the portfolio, upgrading to a larger space when this is needed.
There are also a number of customers who have left the portfolio, gone to competitors and then come back to LEO – the ultimate compliment to our customer service!
What is the most satisfying part of providing customer service for LEO’s clients? Have you had any moments you are really proud of?
Positive feedback is always great to receive, as well as seeing companies grow their business within ours and in some cases progress from 2 to 20 desks.
Which LEO location is your personal favourite, and why?
I have two, which are very different! 85 Gresham Street and 33 St James’s Square.
33 St James’s Square is an extremely large building yet retains a boutique, ‘members’ club’ feel. The building boasts many period features which have been sympathetically restored and provide stunning workspaces: the ceiling of the Robert Adam boardroom is beautifully intricate, and the building itself dates back to 1770s.",en,web

Tsu, Pharm D, BCPS, CGPAssistant Professor of Pharmacy Practice Midwestern University College of Pharmacy–Glendale Glendale, Arizona US Pharm. ABSTRACT: Rates of pertussis (whooping cough) in adolescents and adults have been steadily increasing in the United States. Owing to the atypical presentation of symptoms in this population, proper prevention and treatment are particularly important to reduce the risk of transmission to young children and infants. Treatment of pertussis involves the use of antimicrobial therapy, particularly macrolide antibiotics. Infection prevention in adults is managed through scheduled vaccination with tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis (Tdap). Pharmacists are accessible sources of immunization education and administration, and they can impact infection outcome in patients through timely referrals for antimicrobial treatment and education regarding treatment options and expected outcomes. Pertussis, an acute respiratory infection caused by Bordetella pertussis, is characterized by a paroxysmal cough lasting ≥2 weeks, an inspiratory whoop, posttussive emesis, and posttussive syncope. Of whooping cough is using antibiotics and ""palliative"" care. They know that..., I know that..., but they won't tell you that, for the simple reason that... When you walk into your doctor's office, the first thing they do- Both of which are untrue, but who's going to doubt the word of the doctor, other than those of us, who have been there done that, and proven them wrong? The second thing some parents experience, is being told that... While the medical profession talks about antibiotics making the infection less severe if you catch it very early, the real world reality is that because most of the carriers of whooping cough don't know they have it, most often parents don't know their children have it until about six week month AFTER they first contacted it: Whooping cough is spread by carriers. The real world reality, is that most of the carriers of whooping cough don't know they have it; most are asymptomatic (no symptoms) and most often parents don't know their children have it until about four to six weeks AFTER they first contacted it: Looking at the time frames, incubation is listed as 5 - 15 days . This is followed by an insignificant cold which lasts about a week, then goes away = 12 - 22 days. After about a one week pause, = 19 - 31 days, the cough starts. Most parents don't get concerned until about two weks into the cough, when it's getting worse, and NOT going away. So usually a parent doesn't usually get the child to the doctor until around 33 - 45 days after initial contact. If the mantra is that antibiotics only ""work"" to reduce severity within 3 weeks of contact, what parent is actually going to make it to the doctor in that time frame?
Pertussis or whooping cough is typically characterised by paroxysms of coughing with a whooping sound during inhalation. Whooping cough is caused by Bordetella pertussis and is highly contagious. Although childhood immunisation has been effective in preventing the disease, outbreaks in Australia have been associated with waning immunity in older children and adolescents. The peak incidence of infection now occurs in people aged 15 or older. When given early in the illness, antibiotics can decrease the infectious period, but have no effect on the duration or severity of disease. Symptomatic treatment of cough has shown no clear benefit. Antibiotic prophylaxis of contacts is recommended for certain high-risk groups, but there is limited evidence of its effectiveness. Although infants remain the most at risk for severe, life-threatening disease, it is adolescent and adult booster immunisation which remains critical for prevention programs. Pertussis has significantly increased in Australia, particularly in older children and adults. These patients do not always exhibit classical symptoms and are an important source of infection for young infants. Antibiotic treatment, isolation of index cases and timely vaccination are important strategies to prevent transmission of pertussis. Evidence of the efficacy of chemoprophylaxis for pertussis is limited. Assessing efficacy is often confounded by a delay in diagnosis of the index case. Antibiotic prophylaxis after exposure to pertussis aims to limit transmission to non-immune contacts. It is recommended for high-risk groups such as unimmunised infants, women in late pregnancy and individuals who may be a source of infection.
Whooping cough also known as pertussis or 100-day cough is a highly contagious bacterial disease. Initially, symptoms are usually similar to those of the common. Establishes the medication azithromycin Zithromax, Zithromax Tri-Pak, Zithromax Z-Pak, Zmax, a drug that is effective against susceptible bacteria causing.",en,academic

""Wot's one o' them, then?""
I bet your wrist will hurt later!
Have a sort out in a filing cabinet in workshop,found my Yankee screwdrivers,been years since they were last used.
Just looked on Ebay for Yankee, & they going so cheaply now,& to think what I paid for them new,must be 30 years ago.
In the future most of us will have fat bodies and weak arms and hands due to technology.
50 years ago probably the only power tool you used was a 240volt drill, if you were lucky.
30 plus years ago I still used a club hammer and chisel to cut most holes in walls or concrete floors, etc.
Often the labour was mostly in the work that now we do using Power drills and breakers, in a fraction of the time.
Before SDS drills became the norm, I struggled with some drilling - especially for 20mm holes through walls for pipes.
I used an old auger hand brace to drill holes in floorboards for rad pipes back in the day and used a plugging chisel to hammer through tough stones in concrete walls to fit rawlplugs.
For screwdriving it was all hand screwdrivers and manual work. Then got a Yankee Screwdriver and thought life was easy.
Makes you wonder how all the top quality work (that can rarely be replicated today) was done in buildings built in Victorian times and beyond?
I even found a set of Rawlplug drills from 40 years ago, hammer, turn bit, hammer, youngsters would run a mile if they had to make holes that way today.
But in a world after a nuclear war there will be no power stations going and you will still be able to carry on working with your Rawlplug drills and Yankee Screwdriver.
Don't need Tech for that.
Years ago,when on a job installing a flight simulator, I had to use a Rawlplug jumper to fix pipe brackets for the hydraulic pipe runs. Took me bloody days.
In a similar vein,how many people remember fibre Rawlpugs?
RolandK and Heat like this.
WillyEckerslike and Heat like this.
Paid a pittance and took ages.
I always used them years ago.
They were excellent on softer walls, - plenty of give in them.
My old Dad used to be convinced that the slot in the top of the screw was only to get them out. The Birmingham crew he worked with referred to an insertion tool for the screw as a 'Brumijum screwdriver' that's a hammer to the un initiated.
Lawd, Bob, that gave me a flash-back to when I was in my early teens and was regularly called out to my auntie/uncle's so I could - hopefully - prevent my older cousin from going out on the tiles; the poor guy was an alcoholic from his teens.
On this occasion the pretence was that he had a wardrobe to assemble so was expected to build this before thinking of going out for the eve'. He needed assistance with the large panels - so I was the natural port of call.
I knew what my real job was - to stall him until the pubs were closed. No chance; he built that wardrobe - without my assistance - in twenty minutes flat.
Screws - BAM! In they went - using a hammer. One blow each.
When I tentatively pointed out that - perhaps - they ought to be screwed in so as not to wreck the chipboard, I still remember the glazed look in his eyes and his unchallengeable remark, delivered as a snarl; ""Screws are for unscrewing...""

"In comparison with Elba, this island could be considered tiny, but is instead the second largest island in the Tuscan archipelago and ideal for those who want to immerse completely into nature and peace that nowadays is hard to find at beach-resorts on Elba that are literally assaulted by tourists during high-season. Giglio's profile is mostly hilly and the central ridge of the island slopes softly towards the sea. With exception for the promontory del Franco, characterized by deep limestones, the island consists entirely of granite rocks and from its highest peak, Poggio della Pagana situated almost 500 meters above sea-level, you can enjoy an extraordinary view over the whole archipelago. Although the nature is mostly hilly there are still cultivated areas, especially in the vicinity of the area Campese, and on the del Santo, del Franco and della Fontuccia plains. Analogous to what happened on Elba, fires, sheep-farming and agricultural activities have caused the almost complete disappearance of high-tree woods that once covered the island but that today instead is clad with a luxuriant mantle of Mediterranean bush. Agriculture and fishing have ceased to be the substantial activities in the islands' economy as they have left space for tourism that now is the main spring for the inhabitants.
Traces from the presence of man on the island since pre-historical times have been found and it has been able to confirm that the Etruscans landed here and probably used it as a military outpost.
The islands period of glory is connected to the presence of the Roman aristocrat family Domizi Enobarbi that made it a fundamental marine junction for trade between the different provinces within the empire. Even today there are traces of this prosperous period at the Roman Villa that was the Enobarbi residence and in the many wrecks resting on the bottom close to Isola del Giglio's coasts. Later, the island was passed on to numerous lords and masters and kept on being the prey for pirates' raids, sometimes as terrible as those of Barbarossa who managed to literally raze it to the ground. On the 18:th of November in 1799, the raids on behalf of the pirates' and the Saracenes' were put to an end as the population beat the ""Turchs"" in a heroic battle that finally freed them and made them masters of their own land again. With that, a long period of peace started that encouraged economic activities, a demographic increase and also led to an intensification in mining. The granite caves, that had been explored already by the Romans, were re-opened and with that the exportation of the islands' most valuable materials that still today decorate some of ancient Rome's high-class mansions and numerous Italian basilicas. Today, without a doubt, what attracts tourists are the outstanding sea-beds. The original habitat has been safeguarded by an intelligent environmental protection program and continues to represent a true submerged treasure that every year attracts thousands of scuba-divers. Impressive granitic beds raise from the sandy bottoms and surround the coasts. Rock-faces are covered with sea-fans around which white breams, groupers, morays, corvines and sea-eels swim. The rocks that spring out from the sea-beds' sand form shoals teeming with life and you often see fish like dentex and flocks of tuna and barracuda. Passionates of under-water photographing will not have any problems finding exiting subjects for their shots. Definite protagonists of the islands' submarine set are the yellow, candelabrum-shaped sponges. For those who do not intend to submerge armed with tubes and video-cameras are instead offered coastlines variegated with reefs and dotted with coves and small sandy beaches protected from the wind. Arenella beach is picturesque and gives a romantic atmosphere, just as the small beaches Campese, Cala delle Cannelle and Cala delle Caldane. The tiny Cala del Saraceno, near Giglio harbor, is worth visiting for at least a couple of hours. Those who love walking in the nature or bird watching will find a wide range of possibilities to enjoy themselves on condition that they pack the right equipment in their suitcases and do not put themselves through trekking during the hottest hours, when the sun is pitiless on the rock-paths. Getting from Giglio Porto to Castello is an easy and short walk that takes about one and a half hour. You take on a to a mule-track close to the fork for Arenella along the road that connects the two localities. The track is immerged in the Mediterranean bush and runs along an Ilex grove that stretches from Pettaio to Vado di San Giorgio. Not much further on, a granite threshing floor allows you to enjoy a lovely view over Cala dell'Arenella, Caletta and Torre del Lazzaretto. Continuing along the path you get to the small square infront of the city-walls at Giglio Castello. From this locality, a road of intermediate difficulty starts that in about three hours takes you to Punta del Capel Rosso. You follow the panoramic road that goes from Castello, at Vado del Catinello you take on to a path and as you have surpassed Vado di Pietrabona, it runs along Poggio del Serrone and leaves you walking between vineyards and cultivated pines. The path continues to climb for about half hour and takes us to a panoramic point from where you can sight the sea and the outline of the island Giannutri. The lighthouse at Capel Rosso is situated just behind and from here the path starts to descend towards the southern cape of the island, marking a track immerged between rock-rose and broom bushes. The very same Punta del Capel Rosso can also be reached by taking on to a second path that also starts from the vicinity of Castello but takes on a much more demanding course that takes about six hours. It starts south of Castello, in the locality Le Porte, and as you surpass a small quarry, the path starts to descend and you surpass Cala delle Cannelle, Punta di Campo Marino and Cala della Caldane. After about a one hours walk you wander around the Castellucci crests and get to a saddle situated along the islands' hilly ridge. It is a true sanctuary for nature lovers and you can easily sight wild rabbits and buzzards. A fork on the right leads to Poggio Terneti from where the path descends into the bush until it reaches the granitic block called Poggio del Sasso Ritto. From here you get a lovely view over Cala delle Caldane, Cala delle Cannelle and Punta del Lazzaretto. After having enjoyed the panorama you take the fork for Mortoleto from where the path continues, running along some vineyards and nowadays abandoned terraces until it becomes more narrow and reaches the lighthouse at Punta di Capel Rosso. On the right hand of the lighthouse you come on to a flight of steps that have been carved in the granite and that lead to the sea, above Cala Saracinesca and behind Giannutri and Argentario.

One of my Christmas gifts from my friend Cindy was Full Woman, Fleshly Apple, Hot Moon, a book of poems by Pablo Neruda translated by Stephen Mitchell. Based on my preliminary reading of a few of my favorite Neruda poems in this volume, thumbs up.
Here’s a sample comparison of Mitchell’s translation with a popular translation of the poem, Ode to Ironing. See what you think.

"This report on the telecommunications and information technology gap in America provides comprehensive data on the level of access by Americans to telephones, computers, and the Internet. It includes valuable information about where Americans are gaining access, what they are doing with their online connections, and provides trendline information since 1984. According to the report, the number of Americans accessing the Internet has grown rapidly in the last year; yet, in the midst of this general expansion, the ""digital divide"" between information ""haves"" and ""have nots"" continues to widen.
The level of education plays a key role in determining a person or household's likelihood of owning a computer or using the Internet. Those with college degrees are highly likely to have Internet access from home or work. Meanwhile, the divide in Internet access between the most and least educated widened between 1997 and 1998. The divide is most pronounced in rural areas, where those who are less educated are even less likely to connect to the Internet from home.
61.6% of those with college degrees now use the Internet, while only 6.6% of those with an elementary school education or less use the Internet.
At home, those with a college degree or higher are over eight times more likely to have a computer than the least educated and nearly sixteen times more likely to have home Internet access.
The ""digital divide"" for Internet use between those at highest and lowest education levels widened by 25% from 1997 to 1998.
In rural areas, those with college degrees are over eleven times more likely to have a home computer and twenty-six times more likely to have home Internet access than those with an elementary school education.
Those with college degrees or higher are ten times more likely to have Internet access at work as persons with only some high school education.
Though the Internet is consistently touted as the newest educational tool with the potential to narrow demographic disparities, the data shows that only those who have already attained educational success are using the Internet in large numbers. Consequently, Americans with less education, who could perhaps benefit most from the Internet's educational value, are being left behind.",en,reference
"What a fun and motivating post to work on the day before heading out to Hopkinton!
With about a month to go I put a call out for my “virtual cheerleaders” to help keep me motivated in the final push to get to the start line of my first ever marathon. The results were awesome and I’m feeling so loved! To all my cheerleaders, I would not have been able to take on this challenge without you. Each of you, and all of your pictures, will be on my mind as I make my way 26.2 miles!
These next 26 pictures, 1 for each mile, were sent to me from my dear friends, starring their son Ben (aka Chewie). Leslie said that posing for 26 pictures was like the equivalent of a marathon for Chewie. But with that, I feel he really captures the the emotions, and the pain(?), I’ll be experiencing mile by mile with each of his expressions.
I tend to wear heels pretty often (though near the end of training I cut it down a bit on the daily to try and keep my feet/legs rested). When I got this pic from my aunt, I thought it was perfect! Maybe I’ll train for my next marathon in heels!
This picture from Krista opened the flood gates to my animal cheerleaders!
All the way from Seattle, Bo is exhausted at the idea of running a marathon and Juan captured it perfectly. Don’t worry dude, I’ll run it for you!
One night Scrimmage was looking at me and I could tell he wanted in on the action of cheering for me (yes, I’m one of those pet people at times!) So “we” started using his toys to spell out “Go Mom.” It looked ok, and was even partly legible, but Scrimmage was confused and thought we were playing. He ran through the piles, I was urging him to “stop, stop!” and we ended up with this….some piles of toys and a confused looking dog.
My best friend, Lesley, (or really I should say one of her bunnies) got into the cheer zone all the way from NJ. I do not accept your challenge, Gilbert. I have to work on pacing!
Can’t go wrong when babies and animals cheer together! Thanks Amanda, Joe, Lauren & Bailey!
Little nugget cheerleaders are the best! Thanks Nikki, Brian and Davin!
I was told capturing this next picture took patience, but it was well worth it in my opinion! Thanks Karla!
I wish I looked this great when I run, but all that matters is this is how I THINK I look 🙂 Thank you Karen!
Caitlin truly represented cheerleader style and went all out with the makeup, ribbons and signs! I love that Smithsonian, the trusted travel buddy, also got in on the action! See you at the finish, Cait!!
I can be a total goof, as many of you know. Well this picture gives an insider look into where I get it from. Thanks, DAD!
Lots of love from two of my favorite little people ever, Riley & Brynna (and their parents Alexis and Jason)! I love the details of the sign and am totally feeling the love!
It was great leaving work on Friday having received this card from my colleague, Sarah! Too bad no costumes were allowed this year!
Was a bummer to hear you’re sick, Rebecca, but don’t worry I’ll do the running!
Oh, and did you know that a marathon is 319,236.92 jars of Fluff long? Yup.
Q-town love from my girl and ski sistah Randi! Wish I could have spent some time at the expo with you, but this sign totally rocks (not as much as you!) Thanks for thinking of me & I can’t wait to be your cheerleader for your Antarctica marathon adventure!
Got this on Easter Sunday, the day before the big run. I’ll let the Facebook post speak for itself. Thank you so so much Meghan and Tim!
An oldie, but a goodie, this picture was resurrected to send me some love from my friend Todd, who was our BU mascot Rhett! I remember this day so vividly…Rhett wore my Patriots jersey on the ice!
Dawn, and her chicks, have spirit! Love!!
Thank you all so so much! This was so much fun, having a virtual pep rally and the loves and support is both overwhelming and inspiring!",en,web

"My name is Brooke Korchinski. I am a recent graduate of the education program at the University of Regina.However, I spent my childhood in small town Craik SK, which is located about an hour north of Regina, with my parents, younger sister and brother. It was my experiences in Craik that have impacted me the most, from situations that occurred during school to events that happened within my family. My family has impacted me the most, especially my extended family; who taught me to stand up for what is right, and never allow someone to be belittled for something that is out of their control. My extended family is very large, so you learn to hold your own, be stubborn and, never let others tell you that your beliefs do not matter; but you also learn how to empathize with others, to listen to others, and to be patient. I have spent most of my life being around young children; with a large family there is always someone younger than you. It was my experiences with my young cousins, along with my experiences of assisting with figure skating, teaching swimming lessons, and tutoring that led me in the direction of education. I have always found a lot of excitement in volunteering which I exhibited during high school with the Student Representative Council (SRC), and the Craik School Community Council (SCC); this continued throughout university with an active role as President of the Education Students’ Society (ESS) and Director of Chapter Health with Engineers’ Without Borders (EWB). I took the opportunity to further my own education by attending many professional development events, and taking an active role in my classes, I continue to look forward to being a lifelong learner.",en,books

"Raids are being carried out across the country by the Income Tax department in the wake of the burgeoning fake currency racket post demonetisation, as currencies both new and old have been seized in large amounts from Bengaluru, Panjim and Faridabad and Chandigarh besides the national capital.
The Enforcement Directorate on Wednesday seized Rs 2.19 crore from Chandigarh as part of its operation to check hawala trade in the wake of demonetisation.
Officials said the sleuths of the agency swooped down on the premises of the cloth trader and few other locations, based on a tip-off received by them about huge illegal currency stashing.
While the ED said Rs 18 lakh in new notes was recovered, Punjab Police said Rs 69.35 lakh in new currency was recovered during the raid.
Action has been taken under the provisions of the Foreign Exchange Management Act and the searches are still on, they said.
Chandigarh Deputy Superintendent of Police Ram Gopal said a team led by ED’s Deputy Director Gurnam Singh conducted a raid and seized Rs 1.50 crore in demonetised currency and Rs 69.35 lakh in new currency.
The raid was carried out at house of one Inderpal Mahajan. He has been arrested and a case has been registered against him.
The Income Tax Department made a seizure of Rs 3.57 crore cash, with Rs 2.93 crore in new notes, from Karnataka and Goa with a huge stash being recovered from a flat in Bengaluru which was guarded by two ferocious dogs and an old woman.
Officials said the department sleuths got a tipoff that an apartment in the Yeshwanthpur locality had some cash but they could not execute the search yesterday as the old lady living in the flat refused to cooperate with the taxman and tie the two canines she had.
Finally, the sleuths made an entry with the help of locals and police and found a room that was locked. It was also noticed by the I-T teams that a person visited the flat in the wee hours.
""The locked room was opened and unexplained cash to the tune of Rs 2.89 crore, which includes Rs 2.25 crore of new Rs 2,000 notes, was found.
In a separate case in Goa's capital Panaji, the department seized Rs 67.98 lakh in new notes of Rs 2,000 from a person who met the sleuths who were acting as decoy customers in desperate need of cash.
The department's probe wings of Karnataka and Goa, post demonetisation, have seized a total of Rs 29.86 crore, with Rs 20.22 crore in new notes, 41.6 kg bullion and 14 kg jewellery as part of investigative action to check profiteering in the wake of currency ban.
In Faridabad, four were arrested with new currency of over Rs 25 lakh in the new Rs 2000 notes.
Meanwhile, in Delhi, unaccounted cash worth Rs 64.84 lakh were seized from real estate agent Sukhbir Shokeen in Delhi; Rs 11.34 lakh is in Rs 2000 notes.
yet another raid was carried out at a hotel in Karol Bagh following which the massive amount of Rs 3.25 crore was recovered in old notes.
Upon interrogation it was found that the money belongs to some Mumbai-based hawala operators, who hired packaging specialists who pack these notes in such a manner that it was even undetectable by airport scanning machines.
The I-T department has seized the cash and is analyzing the mobile details which allegedly contain details of lot of other hawala operators.
This recent raid comes in the wake of yet another raid carried out in the national capital, where in a joint raid conducted by the Income Tax department and the Delhi Police, Rs 10 crore was recovered from a law firm in Greater Kailash area.
Acting on a tip-off, the police recovered Rs 2.5 crore in new currency notes and the balance Rs 7.5 crores in old currency notes from the T&T law firm owned by Rohit Tondon late on Saturday night.
Unaccounted cash worth Rs 13.93 lakh, including Rs 8 lakh in new notes of Rs 2,000 and Rs 500, were seized from a local businessman in Chhattisgarh's Raigarh district.
There was information that the businessman, who runs a gift shop, was involved in exchanging scrapped currency notes with new ones following which a police team raided his premises, including the house, and seized cash worth Rs 13,93,173, he said.
The recovered money included Rs 7,76,000 in Rs 2,000 denomination, Rs 24,000 in the new notes of Rs 500, Rs four lakh in the banned notes of Rs 500, besides Rs 1,93,173 in lower denomination notes, he said.
At least 17 bank passbooks, 40 ATM cards, Aadhar cards and other identity proofs in the name of different persons were also seized from his possession, he said.
Following the massive raids on the premises of three Chennai-based businessmen, the Income Tax department last Saturday confirmed seizing Rs 24 crore in new currency notes in Vellore, Tamil Nadu.
During an investigation, the I-T department found out that some cash was hidden in a car in Vellore, upon which it was discovered that all currency was in the form of Rs 2,000 notes in 12 boxes of Rs 2 crore each.
Upon interrogation of those detained in Chennai, a breakthrough was made in the recovery of this cash wherein the IT sleuths laid a trap for the person transporting Rs 24 crores in Vellore and subsequently seized the currency. Interrogation is currently underway of those who were detained in Chennai which could lead to further recoveries.
Following demonetisation, the Enforcement Directorate had carried out massive raids in 50 branches of 10 banks across the nation in an attempt to keep a tab on those account holders, who deposited huge amounts at one time.",en,web

"Now that we’ve crept into the second week of the last major of the year, the world may witness the potential last match of the last American male in the US Open. On the verge of retirement, Andy Roddick will face off against the 2009 US Open champion, Juan Martin Del Potro. The two will meet under the lights of Arthur Ashe stadium in the round of 16.
As you, I hope, have heard, Andy Roddick is playing his final tournament at the 2012 US Open, he made the announcement between his first and second round matches, stating that he’s not 100% committed to the sport anymore.
Well I don’t know if I would exactly call it a run, though it’s been a pretty sweet couple of rounds for the American. He first met fellow American Rhyne Williams, who has a nice game but lacks the experience that Roddick has; straight sets for Andy. He next met Aussie, Bernard Tomic. This has been by far one of the mos controversial tennis matches of the 2012 US Open, if you didn’t see it, Tomic basically handed the match to Roddick on a silver platter.
Tomic’s match against Roddick was really quite sad, even Patrick McEnroe thought the match was pathetic on Twitter, “Pathetic,” he tweeted. “In case you were wondering I was referring to effort from Tomic @usopen.” In any event, Roddick had a quick match then and got some rest. Things were going to get a little trickier for him in the next round.
In round 3 of the US Open, Andy Roddick met Fabio Fognini, one of the prettiest male players out there. Fognini has a pretty good game, he serves well and has enough quickness to dig for balls. Though, the biggest difference was that Roddick had the entire stadium cheering for him (sans the Fognini play box). The crowd seemed to energize Roddick taking him to a two sets to love lead. Somehow the Italian found a way to win the third set, but that momentum didn’t last long as Roddick stayed stead enough to get a break and the match. In this match, I did notice that Roddick was sluggish and just waiting it out only taking opportunities to finish points only when he had them. Thankfully he had a day and half of rest before his match against Juan Martin Del Potro.
This fourth round match is really the only one that you need to watch today. All other matches will be overshadowed with the anxiety the tennis world is feeling today. Tonight’s fourth round match could very well be the last time the world will see Andy Roddick play an ATP level tournament and will be his last US Open. The match will be featured on Arthur Ashe at 7pm EST.
This is going to be either a really tight match or a complete blow out. The two have met 4 times before with Del Potro leading 3-1; however, Roddick did win their last meeting in 2011. A lot has changed since they’ve met, both have been injured – Roddick’s shoulder/hamstring and Del Potro’s wrists.
Del Potro has had some lengthy matches so far at the US Open. The Argentine has played a total of 8 hours 46 minutes to the American’s 6 hours 41 minutes. Those two hours can be the difference in the match. Roddick not really all that fresh on court and Del Potro also lacking a bit of energy in his matches.
This is one US Open match that will be hard to predict, my emotions might cloud my judgement. If Roddick stands a chance of beating Del Po, he’s going to have to find a way to hit away from him. Del Potro is a decent mover though I think he wears out easily. So if Andy figures out how to move him and stay away from the DelPo forehand, he just might have a chance.
Though inevitably, I think Del Potro will come out as the victor. He’s younger and hits bigger than Roddick. His serve is quite nice and placement is impeccable. This could be a match that will go 5 sets, with both players limping to the service line, trying to get that one winner for Game, Set, Match.
Even if you are not much of a Roddick fan, you should make time to watch this US Open match, Roddick has been a constant in American tennis and tonight may be his last match ever.
Side note: Del Potro took out Marat Safin at Safin’s last tournament before retirement.",en,web

"White City, Oregon...June 3...Nick Trenchard picked up his second Roger Haudenshild Tribute win in the IMCA Modified division Saturday night at Southern Oregon Speedway. Trenchard dominated the 25 lap feature for the $1200 victory in much the same way that he won the John Arnberg Memorial last week in Yreka. Trenchard caught lapped traffic and played it safe late as he had a big advantage over second place finisher Albert Gill. The race ran caution flag free, and Jesse Bailey won the $200 Crack The Whip race and finished third in the Main Event ahead of Trophy Dash winner Monte Bischoff and Mark Wauge.
Two time track champion Jorddon Braaten won the 20 lap IMCA Sport Modified Main Event for the $800 prize. It was his second Roger Haudenshild Tribute race win, and he also won the $1200 prize in the Crack The Whip race. Braaten set a rapid pace and won by a straightaway ahead of reigning track champion Mike Medel. Jimmy Lipke, Willie McFall and Rich McCoy rounded out the Top 5 finisher.
Reigning SODCA Dwarf Car champion Brock Peters won his first 20 lap Main Event of the season. Peters took the lead from Ryan Smith on lap three, and Smith was eliminated in a Turn 4 crash along with previous winner Camden Robustelli. After being involved in the lap five caution, Brock's son Cody Peters moved back into second with a three wide pass on the front stretch on lap seven. Cody pressured his father high and low during the final ten laps, but Brock forced him to settle for second. Rob Gergel beat Josh King and Chad Cardoza back to the line in a close three car battle for fifth.
Scott Lenz collected the $800 prize for his victory in the 15 lap Pro Stock Main Event. Lenz added a $200 win in the Crack The Whip race and also had a heat race victory. Lenz chased Jeffrey Hudson for one lap in the Main Event before making his winning pass in Turn 4. A past Pro Stock and Street Stock champion, Lenz led the rest of the way for the impressive win. James Flowers had a strong run in second, and two time champion Ken Irving made a last turn pass on Scott Flowers to finish fourth. John Cobb rounded out the Top 5.

"There are few things in life I enjoy as much as grocery shopping. Yes, seriously! Tonight we went to Whole Foods to do the weekly shopping. I really only needed to pick up produce, but I did have a few must-trys in mind. First, my store finally put out the Daiya, so I had to grab a package of the mozzarella. Everyone has found theirs mixed in with the regular shredded cheeses, however it was with the vegan cheeses at mine. Next, I had to try the new Amy’s vegan macaroni and cheese! I guess I didn’t realize it was made with Daiya until I read the ingredients label, but hearing how fabulous it was I had to check it out. Lastly, I’ve been meaning to try coconut water so a couple of those made it into my cart as well.
I’ve had Daiya before, so I’m just excited to have it so easy to get a hold of now, but with half of a 5 lb. bag of cheddar shreds in the freezer, I just grabbed the one mozzarella. I thought I’d never had this flavor, but I think I did when it was sold as “Italian” shreds. I’m thinking there is a cheezy eggplant dish in my near future! When I got home the first thing to fly from my bag and into the oven was the Amy’s mac and cheese.
Well, before I even got to taste it, it was half gone. At over 500 calories, it was probably a good idea to share! The husband said it was especially delicious and the toddler didn’t need to use words because we could tell he was a big fan by his lack of chewing. Finally, I got to taste it and all I can say is wow! This macaroni is so rich, yummy and definitely a comfort food success. I could eat a mixing bowl full of this stuff, no problem.
After dinner I was still pretty hungry so I made us all strawberry shakes with coconut milk and frozen strawberries. Actually, I’m still a little hungry, but I’ve got some work to get done so a snack will have to wait. I bought plenty of fresh greens I can’t wait to break into! I hope you had a great Monday. I have lots of great recipes coming with today’s produce haul; I can feel it!
I Eat Trees is a blog featuring my adventures in all things vegan. My favorite recipes, snack food finds, and restaurant trials are all on the menu so enjoy!
I bought some Daiya last week. For me, it lives up to the twitter buzz. Very nice.
My co-op has the Daiya shreds now too. It’s back with the other vegan dairy products. Haven’t bought any yet though.
As for the Amy’s Rice Mac & Cheeze. . . I tweeted about this last week and was not impressed. Waaaaaaay too high in calories (520 for 8 oz serving) and fat (22 grams). It was certainly very creamy with the Daiya cheeze but I didn’t think it was that flavorful either. I added salt & pepper which seemed to help a bit. Probably won’t buy it again but I’m glad I tried it so I could see what all the fuss is about.
I think anything by amy’s is destined to be great. Thanks for this review…my hubs LOVES mac n cheese..thanks for this one!
I need to try that Amy’s mac and cheese, it looks amazing! I am now officially hooked on Daiya, so I want to try anything that uses it in the recipe. Yum!
Daiya is a wonderful thing! I have a feeling more “authentically cheesy” products are just around the corner too! Like Melissa mentioned above, the Amy’s is very high in fat and moderately high in calories depending on your definition of high, but SO delicious!
I know, I love grocery shopping! The other day one of my girlfriends was hanging out here and she goes, “I have to go now, I have to go grocery shopping. UGH! Don’t you hate that?” I was speechless for a moment and then I was like, UM, NO!!!!!
Exactly! My friends all hate it too- even one of my vegan friends (which shoots down my “food is more fun when you’re vegan” theory), but I could browse the isles in a great grocery store for hours!
I’ve been seeing this Daiya all over the bloggosphere! I have a feeling I can only get it at WF…do you think it would stay fresh in my car for an hour? lol. I would def. pick some up on my way back from school!
Daiya cheese? Is it really better than other vegan cheeses? I love cheese, but unfortunately, I think it’s not the best for health and for the planet. So having a good alternative sounds great. There’s so many recipes that calls for cheese, and I find it difficult to find a substitute that has the same taste and texture. What’s the Daiya cheese main ingredients?
In my opinion it’s far better than other vegan cheeses, but I hear Chicago Soy Dairy’s revamped Teese is also very good (I haven’t yet tried it).
Here are the Daiya ingredients: Purified water, tapioca and/or arrowroot flours, non-GMO expeller pressed canola and/or non-GMO expeller pressed safflower oil, coconut oil pea protein, salt, inactive yeast, vegetable glycerin, natural flavors (derived from plants), xanthan gum, sunflower lecithin, vegan enzymes (no animal rennet or animal enzymes), vegan bacterial cultures, citric acid (for flavor), annatto.
I’m excited about the re-vamped Teese & can’t wait to try it!
Great, nothing too frightening in the ingredient list. I’ll have to try it!
Holy Hannah, I’m am WAY excited to try that Amy’s! Yesssss!!",en,web

"Can O Chips – Viking Mfg. Co.
Imagine producing a borrowed ring, marked coin?or producing a signed playing card from a container of POTATO CHIPS! A Collectors’ Workshop original.
This variation came from the mind of Richard Stooker of the Netherlands for which we thank him.
In keeping with our Can O’ Corn tradition we have also made a series of Can O’ effects, including Can O’ Peanuts, Can O’ Chips and more.
Imagine producing a borrowed ring, marked coin?or producing a signed playing card from a container of POTATO CHIPS!
Collectors’ Workshop has taken the Can O’ Corn gimmick and modified it so that you can now have the same effect with a container of chips or even a potato chip container (See Can O’ Peanuts). Any similar-sized container of chips can be used.
The performer borrows a spectator’s ring. The object is caused to vanish and as a consolation gift the performer offers the spectator a Can O’ Chips. The spectator unseals the can and sees that it contains salted chips, ALONG WITH HIS RING! The seal has NOT been broken and the effect is as strong as it gets with our masterful gimmick.
Can be used over and over; all you do is supply the container. Container can be examined before the effect and no trace of any tampering is visible. You can perform this within minutes of receiving and can it be performed any where any time. A guaranteed winner.
NOTE: We are showing the large Chip container in the photo but we ship the shorter container to save you shipping costs. Our gimmick will fit either size.",en,web

"Evasi0n team breaks all records – 7 million jailbreaks for 4 days!
No, there is no mistake in the title of this article – 7 million people have used the evad3rs team’s new iOS 6 Jailbreak since it was released 4 days ago, announced Jay Freeman from Cydia. The website that provides apps for iPhones with a jailbreak has recorded a traffic of about 7 000 000 users last night, which is a few times more that the traffic caused by the release of the previous jailbreak from evasi0n – the Absinthe for iOS 5. What’s more, the traffic is constantly increasing!
Among the users that have visited Cydia and downloaded apps are owners of the three types of devices with iOS 6 and their number is varying. The owners of iPhone 5 are the most – more than 5 150 000 people, followed by 1 350 000 iPaders and 400 000 users of iPod touch.
The jailbreak blew off every possible record for a jailbreak usage put in the past, including the before mentioned Absinthe compatible with some versions of the iOS 5 and even the Jailbreakme3, developed as a web-based jailbreak by Comex (a popular iPhone hacker). The first 9 days after its release in 2011 got only 1 400 000 online jailbreaks.
With all these figures of people, hurrying to jailbreak their iDevices, we are wondering why they come to buy them at first place if they don’t like being restricted this way and ask ourselves what they would do if no jailbreak was released.",en,web
"I will be in Phenon Penh for 3 weeks teaching English as a volunteer in January. After that, I would like to visit Vietnam. What is the best way to get there transportation wise? can I go via land? or should I get a flight? should I book the flight in advance? will the price go up exponentially if I book last minute?
Also please, on the money front, I understand I can get cash out of ATM machines, but banks charge quite a bit for each transaction. If I am to bring some cash with me, would that be risky? should I be worried about being robbed?
Clothes wise: any recommendations? skirts have to be of a certain lenght? can I be casual everywhere?
Carrying cash is no more or less risky than most other places around the world. Just take the usual sensible precautions. ATMs are all around these days and are comparatively reliable but remember to advise your bank of the countries and dates you will be travelling otherwise they may block withdrawals.
Casual dress is perfectly acceptbale just about everywhere in teh two countries although it would be polite to cover up when visiting some of the religious sights. Take light cotton clothes or equivalent. Clothing is VERY cheap in the markets so you could byuy all you need there. The Russian and central markets in PP are good for clothes as is Ben Thanh mkt in HCMC.
crellston has covered most issues well. My son resides in Saigon and travels frequently to/from PP always by bus. Travel agents will advise you in PP.
You should arrange a visa for Vietnam before setting off though. Check their government website to determine their requirements. Cambodia allows you to buy visas on arrival but not so Vietnam.
Thank you both for your responses!!
Bus transit between PP and HCMC is easy, cheap and fast. Guesthouses in either places can sort that for ya.

"On December 9, 1992, the Paris Court of Appeal (Eleventh Department) rejected Professor Robert Faurisson's appeal of an April 1991 conviction on a charge of “contesting the crimes against humanity” because of remarks about the Holocaust story he made in a magazine interview.
The appeal court imposed penalties of 187,000 francs (nearly $40,000 at current exchange rates) on each of the two defendants in the case: Dr. Faurisson and magazine publisher Patrice Boizeau. Each was ordered to pay 30,000 francs in fines, and 157,000 francs in “damages” to eleven Jewish-Zionist and other organizations. In addition, each must, of course, bear the legal costs of his defense.
In the interview, published in the September 1990 issue of Le Choc du Mois (""The Shock of the Month""), the French professor commented on the extraordinary Fabius-Gayssot law of July 1990 that expressly forbids “contesting the crimes against humanity” as defined by the victors of the Second World War and punished by the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg. In practice, this law applies only to those who call into question alleged crimes against Jews, and particularly persons who contest the orthodox Holocaust extermination story.
Sometimes referred to as the “Lex Faurissonia,” this law was enacted to criminalize, above all, the work of Dr. Faurisson — Europe's leading Revisionist scholar and a good friend of the IHR.
There was no German order or plan to exterminate the Jews of Europe.
No homicidal gas chambers ever existed in the concentration camps of the Third Reich. The supposed extermination gas chambers, as described by alleged eyewitnesses and perpetrators, could not have existed for physical, chemical, topographical, and architectural reasons.
The familiar figure of six million Jewish victims is absurd.
In the December 1992 decision, the three-judge appeal court (Fran_oise Simon presiding) imposed a total penalty of 374,000 francs on the two defendants, none of which was suspended. Throughout Faurisson's entire testimony, which lasted nearly two hours, Judge Simon ostentatiously averted her gaze from him. She also forbade Faurisson from reading documents, including a portion of the verdict of the Nuremberg Tribunal (the ostensible basis for the law in question).
But that's not the worst of it. In addition to the fines totaling nearly $80,000 in this single case (not to mention their considerable legal expenses), Faurisson and the magazine face two new cases based on the same 1990 interview. As Faurisson has ruefully explained, it's as if someone accused of having stolen a bicycle were to stand trial three times: first for the theft of the bike, then for stealing the wheels, and finally for taking the handlebars. This sort of double and even triple jeopardy is normally rejected by French jurisprudence no less than it is in America: but because it involves the most sacred icon of our age, the legal situation is anything but normal.
Finally, on January 12, Faurisson received a summons for yet another trial. He is being sued because of a fragment of a sentence in a review by him published in the weekly Rivarol, April 10, 1992.
Not surprisingly, French newspapers and television have generally ignored or minimized the appeal court's December decision against Faurisson and the magazine.
Faurisson has decided not to appeal the December decision to a higher tribunal, citing the cost of such an appeal and because he believes that even should his conviction be overturned he would likely be re-tried on the same charges (and incur further legal expenses), to obtain a verdict that would probably be no different from the first.
At the same time, though, Faurisson remains steadfast in his determination to carry on the fight for the historical truth about the alleged gas chambers, and for the freedom to write and speak that truth in France.
An expression of this continued dedication — and of the growth of Holocaust Revisionism — is a rather lengthy and remarkably fair interview with Faurisson published November 11 in the Italian daily Corriere della Sera. In his replies to the paper's respectful questions, the French scholar provided a clear and concise summary of the Revisionist view.
The Paris court's December ruling is of historic significance. For the first time a university professor has been expressly punished by a judicial body for having made public his research on a subject on which it is expressly forbidden by law to contest the official version.
France's Fabius-Gayssot law is free of any such hypocrisy. With perfect cynicism, the “Lex Faurissonia” establishes historiographical dogma. Not even Stalin ever proclaimed a comparable law. When, for instance, the Soviet dictator persecuted the opponents of the quack biologist Lysenko (who was also a member of the Soviet commission that “established” that the Germans killed four million people at Auschwitz), it was not in the name of a specific Soviet law declaring Lysenko's theories to be correct, nor was there ever such a Soviet law. The Fabius-Gayssot law is not Stalinist: it is worse.
In February 1992, a Paris court of appeal ordered Francois Brigneau and Roland Gaucher to pay a fine of 76,000 francs ($15,200) for having published in a weekly periodical a 60-word statement by Faurisson in 1980 refuting the Holocaust gas chamber and extermination story.
In April 1992, the appeals court in Caen (Normandy) upheld convictions against Vincent Reynouard, a 23-year-old chemical engineer, and Remi Pontier, a computer science engineer, for distributing leaflets and stickers that question the existence of extermination gas chambers in Third Reich concentration camps. Reynouard and Pontier thus became the first persons to be convicted under the Fabius-Gayssot law.
In June 1992, a court in Nice convicted two young men for having put stickers on a secondary school building that read “Faurisson is right: Gas chambers = rubbish.” Fabrice Robert, a 20-year-old university history student, was ordered to pay a fine of 10,000 francs ($2,000), and Pierre Ga_z_re, a 26-year-old automobile worker, was fined 20,000 francs ($4,000). Each defendant was also ordered to pay a total of 10,000 francs to four organizations. Finally, the “civic rights” of the two young men were suspended for five years. years. (Among other things, this means that neither can hold any government job, including teacher or post office employee, or work in any government-affiliated agency or business.) This case is being appealed.
In April 1992, Philippe Costa, a 31-year-old engineer, and Laurent Gentel, a 24-year-old law student, appeared in a court in Fontainebleau (near Paris) for having distributed a leaflet advertising audio cassettes of a presentation by Faurisson on the gas chamber issue. The judge in the case declared that no one would be permitted even to mention the words “gas chamber” during the trial, which meant that the defendants could not explain their reasons for distributing the leaflet. They have been ordered to pay penalties of 29,000 francs. The verdict is being appealed.
In mid-December, a court in Amiens ordered Revisionist publisher and writer Pierre Guillaume, and the periodical Nationalisme et République, to pay 103,000 francs for publishing a very cautiously worded article about the Holocaust issue. In addition, Guillaume has been ordered to pay 58,000 francs for having published a translation of an “open letter” by IHR editor Mark Weber (reprinted from the Summer 1988 Journal). Guillaume faces a third trial for having published copies of an article by Pierre Marais, a retired auto technician. Marais himself faces two trials: one for this article and another for a technical study he wrote.
Jewish-Zionist groups are upset that persons charged under the Fabius-Gayssot law have been able to articulately explain in court precisely why they reject the Holocaust extermination story.
Accordingly, an attorney and spokesman for the virulently anti-Revisionist “International League Against Racism and Anti-Semitism” (LICRA) recently proposed a revision of the law that would forbid a defendant in a Fabius-Gayssot case from explaining his Revisionist views in court, or even from repeating in court the “offending” statement.
So goes it for Revisionists in “douce France” (""sweet, gentle France"").
France's Fabius-Gayssot law, and similar legal measures in other countries, would be universally condemned as intolerable restrictions of free speech and academic expression if they involved any issue other than the Holocaust.
Hardly a word about any of these latest French blows against civil rights and free speech has appeared in the American media, which is normally so quick to sniff out every real or imagined violation of civil rights in China, Burma or South Africa.
Such laws and measures are not only chilling manifestations of the power and bigotry of the international Holocaust lobby, they also strikingly point up the bad faith and desperate fear of the lobby in the face of steady Revisionist advances. Historical truth does not need laws to defend itself.
In France — as here in the United States — our traditional enemies have used litigation in their ongoing campaign to destroy Holocaust Revisionism. Nowhere is the legal situation worse for Revisionists than in France, where a special law allows private associations, individuals, and the state to target men and women like our brave colleague, Robert Faurisson.
Robert Faurisson's fight is your fight.

"I came across a week or so ago a treasure trove of Chris Jones (whose stuff I like quite a bit and have linked to and posted about a number of his pieces) writing on ESPN.com.
Here's the link to the ESPN search query for Jones and online now are a number of short World Cup soccer posts that he's done from South Africa. These blog posts are not as long as his features I've most enjoyed (and he probably didn't spend as much time on rewrites), but a lot of them I still consider really good writing.
Probably my favorite piece from his recent World Cup dispatches was ""Not sad to see Paraguay go at all"" on the heels of their defeat against Spain earlier today. It's got all the stuff I like in good writing... an interesting point of view, communicated well, and entertaining in the delivery.
As an aside, one thing I notice in writing from Jones is his phrasing leans towards the dramatic... but doesn't go over the top as I've noticed in some other authors like Gary Smith from Sports Illustrated.
As someone who fancies himself a writer type, me thinks the style from Jones one to try to emulate.",en,web

"FLORA flexible photopolymer are essentially Methacryl-Urethane Photosentitive resin. The resins polymerise when exposed to ultra violet source of light energy. The polymerisation process occuring in plate making equipment convert liquid resin in to elastomer plate. This plates are used for making rubber stamps and making polymer plate for printing on corrugated box, label, envelop etc.
In olden days, printings on corrugation were done by Rubber Stereo. On subsequent development, Photopolymer plate has replace Rubber Stereo. Both above plates making system have limitation. Ultimately, next generation Liquid Photopolymer Resin developed which are excellent replacements of Sheet polymer.
• Flora Photopolymer resins are photosensitive polyurethane elastomer having the form of a coloured viscous liquid. This liquid polymerizers when exposed to an ultraviolet (UV-A) light source having spectrum range between 315 and 380 nanomerters.
• The polymerization process converts the liquid resin into an elastomer that is commonly used for making flexographic plates for printing paper, corrugated box (Flora 125/132) and for making Rubber Stamp (Flora 150).
• Resins are non-toxic, non corrosive, non harmful monomers.
• Large dimension plates can be produced in less than one hour.
• Low specific gravity (1.025 kg/litre) and, therefore, more volume for the same weight.
• Water based ink containing glycerine or alcohol in little concentration, do not affect the life of the plates. Oil based inks can sometimes damage the plates whilst organic solvents (i.e. ketones, esters, hydrocarbons or pure alcohols) can develop a very aggresive action against all photopolymers.
• Do not expose the liquid photopolymer to the direct sunlight.
The biggest advantage of making printing plate for corrugation from Liquid Photopolymer is COST. The per Sq. Mt. cost of plate making from Liquid Polymer is substantially lower then conventional sheet polymer. Beside that, liquid polymer system is environmentally friendly since no hazardous organic chemical are used in washing plate. The plates from Liquid polymer are simply washed by water with small amount of detergent.
In Australia 90 % while in Europe and US 80 % corrugation printer are making plates from Liquid Photopolymer. The obvious resin for choosing Liquid Polymer over sheet polymer and rubber engraved stereo is cost and environmental friendliness of system. In south East and China large number of printer are converting the system to Liquid Polymer rather then Sheet Polymer. With very fast development in chemistry of UV curable Liquid Polymer printer are able to meet the demand of half tone printing at present market. Due to re-claim system for uncured polymer, cost of plate can be controlled.
• All Flora resins have an LD50 exceeding 5000 mg/kg of body weight. This means that they are non-dangerous products (LD50 is the Lethal Dose which effectively kills 50% of laboratory rats).
All liquid methacrylic monomers are chemicals having a low molecular weight and, therefore, are potentially irritating to the skin and eyes. They can cause sensitization by skin contact if continuosly used without precautions. Then, it is advisable to use all liquid photopolymers wearing suitable protective clothing, gloves, eye and face protection. some protective creams are also very effective. Finally, a good ventilation of the working area is essential.
In case of contact with skin, wash with warm water and soap. The use of organic solvents to clean the skin must be absolutely avoided !
In case of contact with eyes, irrigate with plenty of water for 15 minutes and get prompt medical attention where necessary.

"The Center for Computational Excellence (CCE) provides the connections, resources, and expertise that facilitate a more common HEP computing environment and when possible move away from experiment-specific software. This means helping members of the community connect to one another to avoid reinventing the wheel by find existing solutions or engineering experiment-independent solutions.
The HEP-CCE organizational plan is based around two Co-Directors, supported by an Advisory Panel with representation from the HEP Laboratories and universities. A small operations support activity is overseen by the Co-Directors to manage HEP-CCE IT infrastructure, travel, collaboration programs, and organization of workshops and other HEP-CCE-sponsored meetings. The HEP-CCE Co-Directors are Salman Habib (Argonne) and Rob Roser (Fermilab), working with Advisory Panel members Paul Avery (Florida), Andy Connolly (Washington), Kaushik De (Texas Arlington), Steven Gottlieb (Indiana), Mayly Sanchez (Iowa State), and Maria Spiropulu (Caltech).
HEP-CCE activity will take place under three types of programs. The first will be independently managed R&D projects that will be funded as a result of responding to calls from DOE HEP; the role of the HEP-CCE will be to function as an incubator — to help coordinate responses to the calls, to provide feedback and strategic guidance as and if needed, and to maximize the impact of the results of the funded activities to the HEP community. These R&D projects are expected to be small-scale and time-bound in nature. Their primary mission is to function as nucleation sites for innovative investigations that can be taken over later by more mainstream-support entities within HEP, such as the larger experimental projects, or other programs within the three HEP frontiers.
The second set of activities is aimed at making the specific computational expertise that exists within the HEP community more widely accessible and broadly useful. We will support this task by providing small partial-support awards (“mini-grants”) to experts in response to particular needs articulated by the HEP community and tasks delineated by DOE HEP. These activities will be used to promote the broader cause of computational excellence, particularly among junior researchers, such as postdocs and untenured faculty. Internship and exchange programs will also be managed under this sector of the HEP-CCE program.
The third set of activities is aimed at promoting a collaborative culture in computing that cuts across current frontier and project boundaries. Within this sphere, the HEP-CCE will provide the base infrastructure and other limited support needed by a potentially growing number of HEP-CCE affiliates to develop a community-based effort focused on the use of next-generation architectures and cross-cutting applications in different HEP domains. In particular, the aim is to provide an effective avenue for scientists in different fields — especially junior researchers — to interact with and learn from each other.",en,reference

"Spinach is a powerhouse of vegetable packed with nutrients and vitamins. It’s a fast-growing but short-lived crop that is very easy to grow and is equally happy in the garden or container.
Spinach enjoys full sun and a soil that is rich in compost or other organic matter. It requires good drainage and hates having wet feet. Spinach thrives in tubs and containers, and the smaller varieties are even suitable for hanging baskets.
Like building a house, a good foundation is the key to success in your garden. The better the soil, the better your plants will grow. If you are starting with an existing garden bed dig in organic matter like Tui Sheep Pellets and Tui Compost to your soil. Then you can add a layer of Tui Vegetable Mix. If planting in pots and containers, fill with Tui Vegetable Mix.
• Water plants thoroughly before planting and allow to drain.
• Dig a hole, approximately twice the depth and width of the root ball of your plant.
• Partly fill the hole with Tui Vegetable Mix.
• Gently loosen the root ball of your plant and position the plant in the centre of the hole.
• Fill in with Tui Vegetable Mix.
• Press soil gently around the base of the plant.
• Water your plant well.
• Water plants thoroughly before potting and allow to drain.
• Partly fill your container with Tui Vegetable Mix.
• Gently loosen the root ball of your plant and position the plant in the container.
• Fill your container with Tui Vegetable Mix up to 3cm from the top.
• Tap the container gently on the ground to settle the mix.
Feed your plants and they will feed you. Plants use nutrients from the soil as they grow, so replenishing the nutrients ensures your plants grow to their full potential. Select a fertiliser specially blended for your crop like Tui Vegetable Food.
Feed spinach planted in pots and containers with Tui NovaTec Premium fertiliser. Well watered, well nourished spinach will have a better chance of keeping insect pests and diseases at bay.
While your spinach are growing regularly apply a dose of Tui Organic Seaweed Plant Tonic to give them a welcome boost.",en,reference

I saw a cedar mat like this online for $35 and thought, “Hey, I can make a better one for less.” You can build one, too, in three easy steps.
I chose cedar for its looks and rot-resistance, but any wood would be fine.
My mat is 14-1/2 x 30 in., but you can make yours any size. Just be sure the slats are supported by runners no more than 15 in. apart.
Large knots create weak spots, so you may need to buy extra lumber to get sections that are free of knots.
Although the nail holes won’t show, I patched them with wood filler before sanding and finishing. Left exposed, the nail heads may rust and stain the floor.
I finished my mat with tung oil. Oil finishes aren’t as durable as some others, but they’re easy to renew when the finish starts to wear—just wipe on a fresh coat.
Be sure to apply anti-skid pads on the bottom to keep the mat from sliding on hard floors.
If your local home center doesn’t have good-quality 1x2 stock for the slats, buy a 1x6 and cut 1-1/2-in. strips. An 8-ft. 1x6 provided all the slats I needed. Learn how to rip boards on a table saw safely here.
I rounded the slat edges with a 1/4-in. round-over bit. If you don’t have a router, ease the edges with 100-grit sandpaper.
Clamp wood scraps to your workbench to form a square. Lay out the slats against the guide using spacers cut from a paint stir stick. Then cut three runners 1 in. shorter than the width of the mat. Fasten the runners to the slats with 1-1/4-in. brads or nails. Besides paint stir sticks for spacers, see what other unique uses you can get out of free stuff from The Home Depot.",en,reference

"Spina bifida literally means ""spine in two parts"" or ""open spine"".  Spinal dysraphism involves a spectrum of congenital anomalies resulting in a defective neural arch through which meninges or neural elements are herniated, leading to a variety of clinical manifestations. , They are divided into aperta (visible lesion) and occulta (with no external lesion). , Meningocele, myelomeningocele, lipomeningomyelocele, myeloschisis and rachischisis are the usual names associated depending on the pathological findings. Meningocele by definition involves only the meninges with no neural involvement; others have variable extent of neural involvement. The spina bifida aperta is usually associated with skin defect with an impending risk of CSF leak constituting ""open defects,"" whereas the occult forms have normal skin cover. Both forms demand different approaches in their management. The clinical importance of occult lesion has grown tremendously in the recent years.
The number of children suffering from spina bifida and hydrocephalus was large though the detection was sporadic by the pediatricians in the past. With the awareness and growth of neurosurgery in the country, few referral centers established special clinics with an ability to address these problems. Gradually, with the availability of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), several such anomalies were identified, especially of the occult variety. This also helped to visualize a variety of underlying anomalies and their clinical consequences. After pediatric neurosurgery became a subspeciality, several neurosurgeons took interest in this field and contributed in early detection and treatment and also with several good publications. The number of centers has increased across the country. Several unusual anomalies and rare anomalies have been detected and published. Meanwhile, there has been a steady decline in these anomalies over the last decade. Prenatal diagnosis and the medical termination of pregnancy as well as folic acid fortification have contributed. As a result, the anomalies which are not compatible with life and severe anomalies with major defects have reduced, leading to social comfort. Prenatal diagnosis and genetic analysis has become a routine across the country. Few specialized centers have involved in clinical genetics and metabolic workup of these children, contributing to the etiology of many developmental and metabolic diseases. Hence, there has been a shift from open lesion to greater detection and treatment of occult lesions. Considering the size and numbers in the country, a lot needs to be done to provide uniform standards of care in all centers. But it is a happy moment to all of us that several neurosurgeons are practicing pediatrics as their special interest and many are becoming dedicated pediatric neurosurgeons, thanks to ISPN CME Programs for educating neurosurgeons across the country. This phenomenal change and specialization has become a reality by such educational programs.
The estimated incidence of spinal dysraphism is about 1-3/1000 live births.  The prevalence of spinal dysraphism has been in decline the world over in the last few decades due to the better nutrition for women, folic acid supplementation, improved antenatal care and high-resolution ultrasound for prenatal screening and biochemical markers.
Failure of primary neurulation leads to open dysraphism posing the risks of CSF leakage and exposure of neural placode. Extent and severity of neurological deficit depends on the degree of malformation of the neural placode and also the level of the defect. The higher the level, usually worse is the prognosis. A spectrum of neurological abnormalities like hydrocephalus, Chiari malformation More Details, syrinx, gyral malformations, skeletal malformations and uro-vesical defects can be associated. In occult dysraphism, the overlying skin is intact but the spinal cord is anchored to various tissues starting from skin, subcutaneous tissue, adipose tissue or cartilage.
Spina bifida has a multifactorial causation, involving both genetic and environmental. Recent information stressed on the importance of maternal nutrition and folic acid supplementation which has contributed to its reduction. , In India, certain regional factors and consanguinity seem to play a role [hospital-based epidemiological study from NIMHANS (unpublished)].
Open dysraphism presents with a swelling over the back which is noticed at birth [Figure 1]. Symptoms are primarily referable to CSF leak or the exposed spinal cord. Since the skin over the swelling is poorly developed, it usually gives way during labor, resulting in CSF leak, contamination and meningitis. Defects predominantly involve thoracolumbar, lumbosacral, lumbar, thoracic, sacral and cervical in the order of frequency of occurrence. Incidence of high cervical lesions is about 3.9%.  Neurological deficits include motor, sensory and sphincter dysfunction, depending upon the severity and level. In severe cases, hypotonic areflexic limbs, sphincter atonia with rectal prolapse may be associated. Chiari malformation presents with lower brainstem and lower cranial nerve dysfunction. The presence of large head usually indicates hydrocephalus. The associated skeletal abnormalities are kyphosis, scoliosis, and deformities of the long bones and feet, hemivertebrae, defective ribs, etc.
Initial assessment of the newborn is extremely important, preferably both by a pediatrician and a neurosurgeon. Examination of head and neck involves the assessment of head size, shape, skull bones, and openness of fontanelles, lacunar skull defects and the size of the posterior fossa. Examination of the back needs assessment of the neural placode, level of the lesion, condition of the skin, extent of skin defect and associated deformities. Examination of the lower limbs for detection of the deformities of the foot and abnormalities of long bones is important. A detailed neurological examination is necessary to assess the level of motor weakness, sensory level and sphincter dysfunction.
Timing of intervention primarily depends on the clinical condition of the child and the impending risks. Surgery need not be done as a compelling emergency but should be undertaken as soon as it is practical.  In case of suspected meningitis or CSF infection or colonization of the wound, prophylactic antibiotics and anticonvulsants form the initial treatment. Child is nursed in an incubator; routine blood counts and serum electrolytes are monitored. Blood grouping and cross matching is done for possible transfusion. Careful assessment of body weight is essential for intraoperative management. The newborn child with myelomeningocele should have saline dressings. It is essential not to use corrosive agents, spirit or antiseptics indiscriminately over the open defects to avoid damage to the underlying exposed neural tissue.
To obtain successful repair, it is essential to study the surface anatomy and its relationships to the surrounding structures. At the apex of the myelomeningocele usually, the flat neural placode is located and from its edge the remnants of the arachnoid membrane get attached at the nerve root entry zone. From this junction, the nerve roots emerge and exit through neural foramina located ventrally. They are seen through the transparent arachnoid membrane which is fused with the skin at the lateral edges of the lesion. The dura matter which is defective posteriorly is loosely adherent to the underlying soft tissue of the back and densely adherent to the bony structures underneath. Rostrally, the dura forms tube and the neural placode continues into it, which leads to functional spinal cord.
Anatomical in which the conus is placed at a lower level than the normal.
Physiological due to tight or thick filum. In this variety, the conus may be at normal level, but the movement of spinal cord is restrained resulting in neurological deficits and vesicle dysfunction called ""neurogenic nonneurogenic bladder.""
Developmental in which it could be secondary to a variety of conditions like congenital anomalies, terminal lipoma, intraspinal lipoma, lipomyelomeningocele, split cord malformations, sacral agenesis and other occult dysraphic states.
The predominant symptoms can be motor in the form of insidiously progressive distal weakness and spasticity, and sensory ones like sensory loss, paresthesias and trophic ulcers. Neurovesical dysfunction is one of the commonest presentations, ranging from a minor bladder disturbance to frank urinary incontinence, occasionally associated with bowel movement dysfunction. At times, pain can be the major symptom. Pain may be radicular or funicular, low back or calf muscle pain. The scoliosis due to tethering is a much debated issue, but with enough evidence to suggest its role.
A detailed neurological assessment is mandatory. Neurocutaneous markers, like tuft of hair, nevous, dysplastic skin, angiomatous patches, lipoma, dermal sinus, presence of human tail and absence of gluteal folds, can be the strong indicators [Figure 5], [Figure 6], [Figure 7], [Figure 8] and [Figure 9].  Neurovesical dysfunction, leg pain, scoliosis, and motor or sensory deficits should prompt the clinician to look for possible tethering even in the absence of cutaneous markers.
With tethering being a congenital phenomenon, these children often present to their pediatricians with vague leg pains, to orthopedicians with gait disturbance and deformities, to urologists with bladder symptoms like frequent persistent bed wetting, and finally to neurosurgeons when the neurological deficits become overt. Hence, awareness about the recent developments among the medical fraternity is necessary.
The name tethered cord implies that the spinal cord is attached tightly to a congenitally abnormal structure in the lumbosacral area, as well as at the craniovertebral junction. With growth, the spinal cord is stretched between these two points, resulting in insidious and progressive neurological deterioration. The popular belief that the deterioration occurs mostly during the phases of rapid growth is not confounded. During embryonic life, the spinal cord lies way down at sacral segments, and gradually the conus ascends and reaches the adult level at the time of birth, as confirmed by ultrasonographic studies. In this pathological situation, the spinal cord is tethered to anatomical structures lower down, preventing the ascent of the conus in parallel to the vertebral growth. On the other hand, there is disproportionate growth between the spine and the spinal cord, resulting in progressive traction. Normally, when a child bends forward, there is an ascent of the spinal cord by one to two segments. The filum can be short and thick, with anatomically variant fibroelastic fibrous tissue, making it tight and preventing such movement.
Progressive neurological deterioration in terms of motor, sensory or urinary dysfunction in a child is a clear indication. Pain, spasticity, gait abnormality, and persistent or progressive scoliosis are the other indications. Knowing the mechanisms of neurological deterioration, prophylactic surgery is logical. If the neurological deficit has already occurred, surgery should be done as soon as the diagnosis is established.
Proper dural reconstruction with adequate CSF space around the spinal cord to prevent retethering.
A theoretical risk of retethering exists after the treatment of any tethered cord or some of these complex anomalies. Every known precaution should be adopted to prevent such a possibility. This includes complete untethering of all the contributory structures, proper concealing of rough and possible adhesive surfaces by pial sutures, laminectomy to accommodate thickened cord and to facilitate upward movement, duraplasty to create a reservoir of CSF around the repaired structures and epidural fat grafts to prevent fibrosis. Some studies reported advantage of nursing the child in prone position postoperatively. Avoid intradural lumbar drains as far as possible. During follow-up, subtle neurological worsening or progression of deformities should be looked for. MRI should be repeated at the earliest suspicion. At present, there is no foolproof investigation to demonstrate retethering. MRI in prone position to demonstrate CSF dorsal to the conus has been suggested. Serial electrophysiological and urodynamic studies seem to be indicative. Till such time, clinical diagnosis remains the gold standard. All symptomatic children due to suspected retethering should be reoperated to prevent further deterioration. But surgery on pure radiological suspicion for retethering is controversial [Figure 12].
Anatomical features like size of the lipoma, location (midline or paramedian), wide bony defect, defective muscles and fascia, poor cleavage at neurolipomatus junction.
Physiological factors like degree of traction, ability of cord to withstand the effects of traction.
Dorsal variety lipomas enter into the segment of spinal cord dorsally through fibrofatty pedicle, below which normal cord and dura exists. Transitional variety is essentially a dorsal type which covers the entire conus and extends up to the filum. Distally, no normal cord exists, whereas in terminal variety the normal looking conus ends into lipoma through a dural defect and all the sacral roots are cranial to the lipoma.
Broad principles include vertical skin incision, dissection of subcutaneous lipoma up to the fascia, excision of extraspinal component of lipoma, identification of upper and lower laminae and performing laminectomy, identification of normal dura above and below and separation of dural tube from the thoracolumbar fascia all around. These are followed by dural opening (circumferential) around the fibrofatty stalk, removal of intradural lipoma, gentle dissection of fibrofatty pedicle up to the neural structures over the dorsal surface of cord and removal of fibrous tissue up to the neuro fibrolipomatous junction, removal of other fibrous bands and finally detachment of filum.

"Since 1975, there is a statement that makes all local NFL fans universally groan, ""The game has been blacked out."" The blackout rules were instituted by the NFL to help teams whose main form of revenue, in the early days of the league, were from ticket sales. The policy is simply put, if the tickets weren't sold-out seventy-two hours before kick-off, the game would not air locally. It was announced on March 23, 2015, at the owner's meeting in Arizona, that the blackout policy would be suspended for the upcoming season.
American football continues to be one of the most popular professional sports in the world thanks to the millions of people who faithfully watch it, and the billions of dollars they faithfully spend on everything from tickets and cable subscriptions to Fantasy Football.
The week started off with a bang. The Broncos came out and dominated the Chargers putting them squarely into the AFC lead. The Chargers should still make the playoffs, but they need to make sure that they stay steady. The Lions improved to 6-2 while the Falcons continue to go through a free fall. The Rams lost bad to the Chiefs. The chiefs have 3 losses and need to win the games they're supposed to win and a few they're not if they expect to get out of their tough division into the playoffs. The Texans got back on a winning track against the Titans.
Week 7 was certainly an exciting week. Two records were broken and we are starting to see the cream of the crop rise to the top. The Patriots proved they can still score a lot of points in a victory over the Jets. The Falcons continue to lose, as they fell hard to the Ravens. The Titans played the Redskins close, and Colt McCoy eventually took over for Washington. McCoy will start next week. The Seahawks lost a close one to the Rams. I'm not sure if this shows something about the Rams or is an inditement of the Seahawks and how their season is going. The Jags finally got a win, as they beat the Browns fairly easily. Blake Bortles continues to prove himself and the running game really helped the Jags out.
Week 6 started with a good game on Thursday night. The Colts beat the Texans, but the Texans made it close. Their ability to run and Fitzpatrick's ability to run the offense kept them in the game. If they could have defended Andrew Luck better early on, they may have won. The Colts are a team to deal with, but so are the Texans. The Jags are still without a win, just like the Raiders. Both teams played much better this week and the rookie quarterbacks for these two teams are showing how good they are.
The Thursday night game certainly revealed the Giants and Redskins for what they are. The Giants have the ability to beat anyone if the offense is in sink. The Redskins are going to hurt for points and on defense for the time being. They're an injured team without a lot of depth. If Griffin returns he is going to have to really play well to get this team back to it's winning ways. There were a lot of surprises this week. The Cowboys are starting to look really good. The Bears and Packers both went to 2-2 when the Pack beat Chicago. It's a division that's hard to make out. The Texans looked a lot better than many of us thought they would and the Bills are not going to start Manuel next week.
Thursday night did not surprise in week 3 in the NFL The Falcons showed up the way they should have from the beginning of the season and the offense played like gang busters. I truly believe the Falcons were the break out team of the week and will now take the NFC South. According to this week the Bills who are we thought they were and lost to a superior Chargers team. The Cowboys are yet to be defined while the Rams blew a lead. Are the Cowboys that good or the Rams that bad, probably the Rams are that bad. The Eagles have proven they are the class of the NFC East, while Cousins continues to prove himself as a starter, if not for the Redskins future, for someone.

Hello all! Hope you're having a lovely week. Well the move is over and I'm finally getting back into the swing of things. We closed on the old house the same day as Healing Hunter's Heart released and everything moved at breakneck speed after that. During the chaos of moving, I had several days in a hotel while waiting for things to move along for the close on the new house. I was prepared with the notebooks and tech I figured I might need, including mobile WiFi Hotspot just in case. Luckily the hotel had free internet access which kept me from feeling completely disconnected. Everything else was in storage. I also had furbaby-who's-not-so-baby-anymore Olly with me. I was a little worried about how he'd take to life on the road, but he was such a good boy.
In a way having to wait, along with my somewhat limited internet access, helped me focus on writing and getting some work done. Considering I only had to push back one of my titles since the deadline fell just as things were crazy with selling, packing, house hunting, and all that fun stuff, I still managed to make two of my three deadlines. I think I managed pretty good. I was worried moving would wreak havoc on my schedule, but I managed pretty well. I'm still catching up on emails and few odds and ends, but thankfully everything's settled down, which means I've been able to take part in a few events I wasn't sure I'd be able to manage because of the move.
July 17th & 18th (Friday and Saturday) - I'll be attending Rainbow Con. Although I won't be taking part in the panels or the signing, I will be there hanging out and just having fun, so be sure to find me to say hello, chat, or if you'd like a book signed. I'll also be tagging along on the Big Cat Rescue Trip because I've been dying to go and omg, how can I not?! Big kitties!
RT Booklovers Convention 2016 - I'm taking the plunge and attending next year's RT Booklovers Convention in Las Vegas. I'm super nervous but also very excited! More info on that soon.

But as your friendship develops, these differences could become a real problem, and you could cause a rift between you and your friend if you aren't careful in how you treat them. Whenever your buddy has a brilliant idea, you'll quickly yank them back to reality, exposing the flaws in their logic and the practical reasons why the idea just won't work.
You'll think you're helping them, and you may be right -- they could be a real dreamer. But dreams, hope, faith, inspiration -- all of these are essential complements to reality, practicality and sober thinking, and your insistence on the latter will make your buddy feel inhibited.

"On June 30, the Tezos Foundation proposed a genesis block that became the seed of the Tezos network. For a time following the proposal, there was an expectation that, while fully operational, the network had a higher likelihood of experiencing unscheduled downtime along with maintenance and adjustments, and so we regarded the network as a betanet. Over the course of the last few months, we have been happy to see the network operating smoothly and efficiently. The community has been actively engaged, with more than 400 validators (“bakers”) scheduled for an upcoming cycle. In addition, the community has been developing an array of exciting technologies and other tools to increase community engagement, understanding of the network, and adoption.
As a result, we now consider the beta period concluded, and while active development still continues, we are pleased to regard the Tezos network as the mainnet.
Please remember that the Tezos network is a new blockchain technology. As with any new blockchain technology, unexpected issues may still impact the network. Users are solely responsible for any risks associated with usage of the Tezos network. Prospective users should do their own research to determine if Tezos is the appropriate platform for their needs before engaging. In addition, those already on the network should apply judgment and care in their network interactions.
As a general reminder, any party or software, such as a wallet, that gains knowledge of private-key information will have access to the tokens controlled by the associated public-key hash. Always think twice before entering private-key information anywhere. There is nothing that the Foundation can do if tokens are lost or stolen.
We expect that the community will, over time, bring a range of new and exciting developments to the network, and are excited to stand as a part of the community to support that progress.

"Home > Interventions > Strengthen Leadership > Grow talent > Resilience : Self-Actualization or the Wages of Fear?
Isn’t this what the people in our organizations are demanding from their companies today in a world of change, complexity, uncertainty and sometimes bullying?
We’ve seen what happens in those cases: fatigue, lack of initiative, skepticism and weariness. People might still fill in the yearly engagement survey with a sarcastic smile. But maybe they’ll just sit there, stifling their rage.
Our clients, who’ve noted these phenomena, have started asking us to work with them on this. The initial request is a straightforward and classical one: how can we improve the morale and individual effectiveness of our people in a working world that keeps going faster and faster, with greater and greater constraints, and stakeholders who are more and more numerous and demanding.
We’re in a world where individuals feel they’re drowning in a maelstrom of conflicting priorities.
We all know the traditional response: could you please just figure out how to manage your stress and emotions, and get on with it!
You’ve heard that in your companies, haven’t you? But we are convinced that the classical responses that are all about “increasing effectiveness at work”, “learning how to manage your time” and “improving your interpersonal skills” are not relevant here. All of this might provide a short-term band aid but it’ll rapidly turn out to be useless. Individuals and teams need to be able to unlock sustainable solutions, and these come from inside themselves, not from any tools or superficial techniques.
And so we take a totally different tack. For us, it’s about developing Resilience and reinforcing the four internal sources of Energy this entails.
Often individuals and teams feel overwhelmed by what they define as all-encompassing, insoluble problems. We begin by asking people to note down specifically how they affect them. We’re working with the catharsis of crisis here: acknowledge the emotional state; free up emotions; become fully mindful of the situation; take a step back. That’s how people get to the point where they can see a situation differently—where they can clarify their own goals and re-capture their decision-making energy. You know the old proverb: “if you get the problem right, you’re half-way to the solution”.
You might ask, why go through such a process? Why take this risk? Isn’t it less risky to ignore those painful situations? Why not just develop a few techniques and tools so people feel less “hurt”? OK, but not sustainable. You want to master your destiny during really tough times? Get back in touch with your own self-empowering energy. This is the first basic component of Resilience.
And so we work on another series of challenges that help people figure out how to express personal needs and positions firmly and constructively; negotiate acceptable terms for working together; and respond in a deliberate and measured way to excessive pressure from those who represent “authority” and “power”. In other words, deal successfully with an ever-growing list of priorities, pressures and urgent tasks.
We gear up each of the participants and teams so they can confront these difficulties and free up their potential. The idea is for each one to anchor the conviction, within themselves, that there is always a solution and it is neither impossible nor forbidden to improvise! This is a second key element of Resilience.
But what do we do about that little voice we all have inside ourselves that whispers “it isn’t good enough”; “I’ll never be able to do it—I just can’t”, “it’s impossible”? That’s the next thing that comes up. Let’s face it: no externally-driven tools and techniques have a chance against our internal saboteurs that drag us down in front of hurdles we could actually overcome.
There’s a classical approach here too: rote implementation of “best practice.” But that is driven by the outside and so will only get you so far. Once again, the most powerful weapon comes from inside ourselves: our personal energy and ability to recognize and value who we are and what we bring to a given situation.
So how do we access that? We explore various ways to do this by encouraging participants to work on, for example: What can I learn from my own mistakes and failures and also successes in difficult situations? How can I truly acknowledge and develop what makes me unique? How can I get more and more pleasure out of what I do in my working life?
The “sabotaging the saboteurs” energy is a third component of Resilience. It gets us beyond our “limiting beliefs” and we can no longer be crushed in the same way.
“Petites mains” (low-level workers, in French) is a documentary by Thomas Roussillon about Lejaby, a lingerie company that was about to shut down, leaving all workers out of a job. In the film the workers describe the solidarity among the seamstresses as one of the major components of the Resilience that allowed them to hold out.
People need to identify and then call upon those who can help them get out of a hole that they might think is protecting them but that is in reality just keeping them down. It’s not easy to ask for help in our “Be tough and get on with it” world. A word of caution, however: turning to allies isn’t about complaining together and rehashing common problems. We’re talking about the solidarity that is built up on the first three energies so that each individual or team can take control of their difficult situation. The Energy of Allies is the fourth energy of Resilience.
So you see, developing Resilience isn’t about a tool box. It’s a journey where people get to free up energies inside themselves, develop mindfulness and overcome limiting beliefs so they actually shift how they position themselves in their world.
That’s what people work on in our “RESILIENT©” program. The Resilience of individuals and teams is the key to confronting our global, complex and unpredictable world. At ICM we hope that engaging on this path will go beyond reacting to a tough situation and turn into a real learning process. Resilience is about going beyond fear and resignation to agility, control and self-actualization.",en,reference

"We all judge each other – this is a fact of life. I believe I speak for the majority when I say, if you can genuinely look someone in the eyes and say you have NEVER passed judgment on another person in any way, you would be lying.
Judging someone comes naturally to us because we view and assess people based on our own person concept of “the norm.” Sometimes we judge because the other person contadicts our own believes- of what we should dress like, look like, believe in, enjoy, hate, and the list goes on.
What say we shift our perspective and turn it around. What do you think you are personally judged on? When honestly asking myself that question, I know I’ve got my own strengths and my own weaknesses. However what makes one ‘s perception and opinions right, and the other’s wrong?
Why are we so quick to judge a person on how they look or dress and toss them into a pre-conveiced category; and more importantly how is it fair?
I once saw a man on a train dressed as female – wearing a bright yellow dress with mascara and bright red lipstick. I could see the looks people were offering him and it made me sad. I used to admittedly be one of these people. Having changed my preception since, I saw it differently. I thought to my self – I would love to honestly have to confidence to step out of my apartment and be myself completely – inside and out. Why coudln’t we look at him and admire him for his courage, because in a way he has more confidence than most of us .
How much more as human beings would we learn and evolve if we accepted others for who they are and learn from one another. Would society not evolve for the better? There would be less hate crimes, bullying, racism; and more love, acceptance – that is for certain.
Just remember when you’re passing judgement on another, often times it is but a reflection of your own insecurities. Being a good person generates a positive environment around us, allowing us in turn not to judge ourselves quite as harshly either.. Until one is able to accept other people and find positives in all our unique differences, we will struggle to fully accept ourselves, and we as a people will struggle to progress as a united race.
So the next time you see a man in a yellow dress and mascara, try to commend him for his courage and the ability to be himself. We are not all always going to agree on what others are trying to do or say, but we can most certainly learn from it and broaden our horizons.",en,books
"If elderly people are moved into sheltered accommodation or care homes, they suddenly face many problems, often including a sense of dislocation. It would be easy to discuss or investigate how bad this problem is, exactly what troubling effects it leads to, and other problem-focused lines of inquiry. Another option would be to do something worthwhile to give the new residents more of the feeing they want - of something familiar.
I was talking with Dutch colleagues, who told me of one care home which took photos of their residents' old front doors, printed them life-sized and used them to cover each of the residents’ respective new front doors. The residents found this helped them enormously. Very neat! What could better prompt that feeling of being at home (given that you no longer can be), than returning each day to your own front door?",en,books
"The Department of Public Instruction (DPI), in its recent circular, has asked school administrations to make use of vacant space available on the school premises to grow vegetables, fruits and leaves as part of the “Maguvigondu Mara, Shalegondu Vana” programme.
Already, many government schools in Mysore district have developed gardens on their campuses and are growing vegetables that are used in cooking meals.
Some schools were even sharing vegetables and fruits with other schools at a nominal cost. Such schools have emerged as models for others to replicate, according to sources in the DPI.
Ningarajaiah, officer in charge of Akshara Dasoha in Mysore district, told The Hindu that the department had asked schools to implement the scheme from the coming academic year. The schools had been told to encourage each student or a student group to plant a sapling, preferably fruit-bearing plants, and nurture them on a regular basis.
Also, the schools had been told to beautify their campuses by planting flowering and ornamental plants. Instructions had been issued to the officials concerned for implementing the direction issued by the Commissioner of Public Instruction effectively from the coming academic year, he said.
Mr. Ningarajaiah said the government school at Chikkegowdana Koppal village at Yelwal near Mysore has become a model for other schools as it has become self-sufficient and has been giving out the produce to nearby schools. Other schools in the area have started replicating the concept, he added.
“The idea is not to minimise the expenditure on the meal programme but to develop a healthy ambience in the schools,” he said, adding the schools have funds that could be used for developing these gardens.
He said there are plans to coordinate with the Department of Horticulture in Mysore district for procuring vegetable seeds besides saplings of drumstick, papaya and other fruits.
Even though vegetables grown on school premises were being used in cooking food under the Akshara Dasoha scheme, the cost of meal per child will remain the same, according to Mr. Ningarajaiah.
The cost of meal per child is Rs. 3.34 (from classes I to V); Rs. 5 from classes VI to VII and Rs. 6.64 from classes IX to X. This excludes the cost of rice, which is supplied at subsidised cost by the Union government through the Food Corporation of India. The State government pays Rs. 565 for a quintal of rice, he said.",en,web

"Mazda joined the crossover race later than other Japanese brands. Toyota, Honda and Subaru were already working on the third generation of their crossovers, and Nissan and Mitsubishi were working on the second, when in February 2006 at the Los Angeles auto show the Mazda CX-Crossport concept was shown, which after a little tweaking and minimal changes and went to the series in April of the same year as the Mazda CX-7. Mazda had to offer something new in the already highly competitive market, and this “something” was not the usual motor for the family of universal cars.
Under the hood of the crossover, a four-turbocharged 2.3 MZR L3-VDT was registered, borrowed from the Mazdaspeed Atenza sportscar (aka Mazda 6 MPS) with a K04 turbocharger retuned to lower power and more torque. Power for different markets ranged from 238 hp (in Russia) up to 256 hp (in England). Transmission – or six-speed automatic Aisin Warner AW TF-80SC (aka – AWF21, AF40-6, AM6, AW6A-EL), or six-speed mechanics. All-wheel drive Active Torque Split AWD with Haldex controlled electronic multi-plate clutch was taken from the same Mazda 6 MPS.
Somewhat later, a version with a 2.5-liter atmospheric engine MZR L5-VE with a power of 161 hp was presented, which was combined with a five-speed automatic – in Russia such cars appeared after the 2010 restyling. In addition, the Europeans and Australians were offered an option equipped with a 170-horsepower diesel MZR-CD.
The front suspension is almost unchanged borrowed from the large Mazda MPV minivan, and the rear suspension from the more compact Mazda 5 van. In some publications, they write that the Mazda 3 was the donor of the rear suspension, and this also has no mistake: all three of these The models that have come into being during a very short period of time are almost the same.
But the CX-7 was not the only motor. An important role was played by the appearance. While most brands relied on versatility and family values, trying to emphasize the family resemblance to “real” off-road vehicles, the chief designer of Mazda, Ivao Koizumi, decided, on the contrary, to build on passenger models and offer an alternative to European premium ones rather than Japanese competitors.
The idea was clearly a success – in Russia in the pre-crisis 2007, the purchase queue was 6 months! Over time, the initial excitement subsided, especially since during operation revealed weak spots and congenital sores. Some of them were successfully stopped during the restyling of 2010, when, on the one hand, pretentious chrome moldings and edgings appeared in the exterior design, and on the other hand, the models were supplemented with a range of models only with a front axle and a weaker engine.
However, the “seven” was not destined to become a super-mass car: in the best years, the sales volume of this model did not exceed 4,500 units, and in 2012, the headquarters of the Japanese company decided to stop producing CX-7 and focus on its consumer properties close to but slightly smaller in size, which means more affordable model CX-5.
Now prices for the CX-7 on the secondary market range from 300 thousand for the oldest and most well-groomed options to 1,000,000 for the most recent, 2012. And what do the owners write about the car?
Someone finds in the CX-7 the embodiment of all their aspirations, and such reviews literally shine with delight: “The car is just super !!”, “Fantastic!”, “She wants to praise and praise!”, But for someone the purchase turns around only disappointment: “Sold and crossed”, “Do not get fooled by a beautiful candy wrapper!”. So let’s understand what, besides the appearance, Mazda CX-7 is captivating, and what causes tooth gnash.
Fortunately, the plastic turned out to be hard, but not creaky. Complaints about the “crickets” are found, but quite rarely, and many cars do not suffer from the invasion of these insects even after ten years of difficult life. But many owners mention that plastic on dorestaylingovyh CX-7 is very easy to scratch – even with a key, even with a fingernail.",en,reference

"Paul McCartney began the Freshen Up tour with a 39-song set at the Centre Videotron in Quebec City last night .
The shows are in support of his new album, Egypt Station, which just became McCartney's first No. 1 LP in 36 years.
The set began with ""A Hard Day's Night,"" one of 23 Beatles songs performed at the concert. McCartney pulled out seven cuts from his Wings days, including ""Letting Go,"" the Venus and Mars track that made the Top 40 in 1975, and ""Let ""Em In,"" which he hasn't played since 2012.
McCartney also promoted his latest album with ""Come On to Me,"" ""Who Cares"" and ""Fuh You."" You can see video and the set list from the show below.
The concert was the first of four nights in Canada, with shows in Montreal, Winnipeg and Edmonton taking place between Thursday and Sept. 30, after which McCartney will head to Japan and Europe.
The Canada dates are the closest he'll get to the U.S. until May 23, when he begins a month-long tour at the Smoothie King Center in New Orleans.
While McCartney is actively working his latest album, he's also considering looking back into his past for his next. He recently said there's a possibility of a new edit of the 1970 Let It Be documentary, which hasn't been commercially available since 1982.

"SEATTLE -- Seattle already has removed more homeless encampments this year than it did in all of 2017, with a sharp increase in the cleanup of camps without prior notice to residents.
The Seattle Times reports 220 sites have been cleared between the start of 2018 and the end of July, compared to 191 camps last year.
Information the city released Tuesday shows the city removed 89 encampments since the beginning of 2018 without having to provide 72-hour notice or offers of shelter to the camp residents, a dramatic uptick compared to the previous year. That's about 40 percent of the removals this year.
The surge comes amid Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan's focus on adding at least 500 more shelter spaces throughout the city, which also involves increasing Seattle's supply of tiny house villages for homeless residents.

"In a back-to-back activity following the success of the Panagbenga FamilySearch Interactive Booth, the Baguio Philippines Stake (diocese) of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints joined the Strawberry Festival celebration by holding a 3-day FamilySearch Interactive Booth in La Trinidad, Benguet.
From 18 to 20 March 2019, 2, 681 people from around the province of Benguet visited the family history booth and learned the basic ways to build their family trees. It’s the first time for the Church to join the month-long Strawberry Festival and the members were thrilled to continue their endeavor to share the joys of family history work to the locals.
“I-Benguets (people from Benguet) love family so this FamilySearch program is very beneficial for us that is why we wanted to have a Family Search booth this year at our festival,” says La Trinidad Mayor Romeo K. Salda during the opening.
The La Trinidad Strawberry Festival is an annual month-long celebration held every March to promote the strawberry and tourism industries of the Valley of Colors. This year, however, the home and family serve as the highlight of the festival’s theme. With the theme “La Trinidad, My Home, My Pride,” Latter-day Saints in Baguio saw the event as the perfect avenue to introduce the Church’s family history program to the locals, families, and tribes in the province.
As it was the first time for the Church to join a festival, several members volunteered their time to help man the booth and to invite people to learn about genealogy. Despite the unstable weather conditions and the challenges encountered as they talked to individuals unfamiliar with family history, the volunteers stayed diligent with their task.
The fruits of their labors were evident by the positive experiences guests enjoyed as they visited the booth. Some of the elderly visitors were so happy and amazed at the program that they have requested for the family history consultants to join their upcoming grand clan reunions to introduce the FamilySearch to their families. Additionally, several visitors requested for the Ilocano version of the Book of Mormon.
Overall, the FamilySearch Interactive Booth proved to be a success as it not only help families and individuals learn how to connect with their ancestral line but also gave members of the Church an opportunity to serve their neighbors, the people in Benguet.",en,reference
"For four decades, the predominant belief among scientists was that nonhuman primates could not produce human sounds because of limitations in their vocal tract anatomy. Now a team of international scientists are debunking that claim with evidence that it’s a difference in neural capability, not anatomy, that has kept primates from communicating like humans.
In a paper published in Science Advances, the scientists explain that they hope their research could help narrow down the origin of human speech. They came to their conclusion by working with macaques — a monkey that belongs to the genus of Old World monkeys. But they argue that the existence of human-like vocal tracts in macaques suggests that more recently evolved primate species, like chimpanzees, likely have a similar vocal tract as well.
If that’s true, then the fact that the chimp Caesar in the franchise Planet of the Apes developed the capability for human speech makes scientific sense. In the film, Caesar becomes hyper-intelligent because his brain is affected by an antiviral drug called ALZ-112. Looking at this research, it’s possible that as a chimp Caesar had an anatomy capable of speech all along — and it was the change made to his brain that made the difference.
To come to this conclusion, the researchers used x-ray videos to study and quantify the vocal tracts of macaques during their vocalization, facial displays, and feeding. Previous research hadn’t looked at live macaques, and instead came to a conclusion from plaster casts made from a cadaver monkey’s vocal tract.
They took the data on the macaque’s physical attributes from the x-ray videos and plugged it into a computer model that could predict and simulate the monkey’s vocal range. They determined that the macaque could produce vowel sounds and full sentences with its vocal tract but lacked the neural ability to actually speak. The researchers note that while humans could likely understand a macaque (again, if it had the neural capability) we still wouldn’t think the monkey sounds like a human.

The researchers now hope to research chimps in the same way, and believe primates could be used a model to understand early human speech development and speech evolution.",en,reference
"If you are looking for a fun excuse to throw a party, especially after a long drought of officially sanctioned party days, you might want to consider some days that are not widely celebrated in North America, but are popular nonetheless. Each of these events offers some great opportunities for decorating.
Chinese New Year: No one has been celebrating New Year's for longer than the Chinese, and this is reflected in the 15-day-long event. Chinese New Year is a great opportunity to decorate the house for more than two weeks, leading up to the culmination of the holiday, the Lantern Festival. Reds, blacks, and yellows are the big colors of the day. Traditionally, many Chinese families have decorated their houses with flowers and bamboo. Dishes of fruit (oranges and tangerines), and traditional candy trays. You will also want to include a lot of Chinese paper lanterns, a delicate and beautiful addition to the party d'cor. Dragons are also a part of the holiday, but remember that they are considered sacred so utilize this theme in an educated manner. Noise makers area traditional part of the Lantern Festival, and ward off evil spirits for the New Year, as well as being great party favors.
Cinco de Mayo: Cinco de Mayo offers great opportunities for party decorations. Lots of bright oranges, reds, and yellows are the color scheme for the day, and will add a Latin flavor to your house. Look into getting (or making) a chili pepper wreath to spice things up. Ribbons and streamers should be thick crepe, in the colors of the day. Don't forget to purchase a pi'ata or three for some extra fun!
Food can actually add to the feeling of great party d'cor, and the food for Cinco de Mayo illustrates this perfectly. Layered dip, black bean and corn salsa, and three-milk cake all add a splash of color to the well-set table!
St. Patrick's Day: It almost goes without saying, but the theme for the day is green. Buy green balloons and shape them like clover for a great effect. You can also purchase shamrock-shaped balloons and hang them about your house. Hang some Irish flags above the door for good luck, and use a lot of green and white ribbon. Get yourself some St. Patrick's Day paper plates and napkins and your theme is totally set!
For any special occasion, even other than national holidays, throwing a party is a great way to relax with your friends, neighbors or co-workers and socialize. These holidays are great because they are so colorful and full of tradition. Party supplies, that bring your party theme alive will make the event unique and will be something your guests always remember.

"Loki peered into the dark trees beyond the camp. Something rustled in the underbrush. Not for the first time in this long night, he wished he could turn up the volume like he did on his headphones at home, adjust the contrast on a monitor—cheating a little—so he could see more details in the oppressive blackness outside their tiny, fragile circle of light. But as he had to keep reminding himself, this wasn’t a game.
God, he missed his computer.
Setting up base in the clearing had seemed like the most natural thing to do, but now it seemed foolish, knowing they were surrounded by an unfriendly, unknown wilderness, crawling with creatures that could kill them. Unimaginable creatures. Impossible creatures.
Their whole situation was impossible. As far as they could tell, they had each been transported here at the precise moment they had died. Or been resurrected? Saved, some of them even called it. Hyrum insisted they were all still dead, existing in some kind of messed-up purgatory.
Loki glanced at Cole, resting by the fire ten feet away, possibly dying. Try telling him they were already dead.
Maybe Loki should have tried harder to convince the others to relocate, move to higher ground if they could find it, maybe shelter in a defensible cave or the nearby ruins. Perhaps they could have found a stable roof, real walls. Preferably a sturdy door with a dead bolt. But other voices were louder than his, and he didn’t want to push too hard. Not until he had to. People—even the ones you trusted—could turn on you quickly, and the other kids were practically strangers. He had been useful here so far, so some of them actually liked and trusted him. He had to keep it that way if things were going to go differently this time around.
That’s what second chances were for, right?
There was the rustling again. Loki’s muscles were tensed, ready, but he willed himself not to scramble to his feet, or shout an alarm, or shut down from terror. Slowly, very slowly, he turned his head to follow the sound—the movements of something . . . some thing that was moving equally slowly. Stalking.
Loki reached his left hand down for a rock from the pile at his knee. He felt around, eyes locked straight ahead, until he found one the size of a baseball. He picked it up, rolled it in his hand, and wrapped his fingers around it the way he thought pitchers did.
The creature could be anything—the sow they’d seen a few days ago or killer bunnies. It didn’t have to be the toothy cat that had scratched Cole and knocked him out of that tree. He hoped it wasn’t.
Loki stilled and caught his breath when he saw a glimmer in the darkness, directly ahead of him. Two small, glowing orbs. Eyes. Staring back at him. They had caught the reflection of the dying fire for a moment, reminding Loki of his obnoxious cat, Meowth, looking up at him innocently from beneath his desk after biting his ankle. Only this cat was ten times the size of Meowth, still had all its claws, and also had very long, very sharp teeth.
Cole moaned by the fire. The cat eyes disappeared.
Not knowing where the predator was made Loki even more nervous. But the soft sound of its movement faded—to the west, in the direction of the ruined city. Loki relaxed. Just as well. The last rock he had tossed to scare it off had gone wild, and his left shoulder still twinged from the effort.
Loki jumped. He turned to see Cole propped up on his elbows, blinking in the light from the fire.
“Oh. I was worried you were about to brain me.” Cole chuckled and then started coughing.
Loki dropped the rock like it was his sister’s underwear, accidentally pulled from the laundry basket.
“Why would I do that?” Loki jammed his hands into his jumpsuit’s pockets and balled them into tight fists. Have they been talking about me? he worried.
He hadn’t intended for Cole to get hurt. Loki might blame himself for letting it happen on his watch, but did everyone else think it was his fault too?
“I don’t know. You looked . . . intense.” Cole coughed again. His voice was weak and dry.
Loki brought Cole a canteen and helped him sip water.
He shook the canteen and heard a hollow slosh. Almost empty. This was the last of the water supply. They’d have to send another group to refill their bottles at the stream today and boil the water for safety.
“No problem.” Loki relaxed his fists.
“You should go back to sleep.” Loki settled in next to Cole by the fire.",en,books
"DALLAS—Julie Chapman doesn’t really have time for sentimentality these days, given that she’s following a six-page email on how to close the Cokesbury store here.
The going-out-of-business sale is underway, and Ms. Chapman, as store manager, is charged with selling just about everything, including bookshelves, before the doors lock for good on April 20.
Still, as she deals with familiar customers, many distraught at the store’s fate, her own emotions kick in.
“It really is like grieving a death, because the Cokesbury stores have been around forever,” Ms. Chapman said.
Across the Methodist connection, a long goodbye is underway for all 57 Cokesbury stores. Though generations of Methodists and others have depended on them for books and church supplies, the United Methodist Publishing House announced in November that it could no longer afford to operate the stores, given the shift to online shopping.
Since January, Cokesbury stores have been closing in small groups, by schedule, leading to a ripple of farewell events that will continue until the last close on April 27.
The Rev. Harriet Akins-Banman organized a March 1 worship service at the Little Rock, Ark., Cokesbury to recognize the end of its ministry. A dozen faithful gathered for hymns, communion and testimonials amid nearly-bare shelves.
“I can remember calling more than once in an 11th-hour panic” for a worship supply or curriculum item, Ms. Atkins-Banman said.
At stores where the days are still dwindling down, customer moods range from wistful to angry.
“Actually, I hate it,” said the Rev. Denise Peckham, pastor of Button Memorial UMC in Little Elm, Texas, when asked about the closing decision as she shopped in the Dallas store on Feb. 22.
She’s on a first-name basis with employees there, who have steered her to good books and other products. And while she orders books online, she likes to look at them first.
Neil Alexander, president and publisher of the United Methodist Publishing House, acknowledges hearing from many like Ms. Peckham.
“We’ve worked hard to make the stores as welcoming and effective as possible to serve thousands of people in scores of local areas for decades, and the fact that they will be missed by many is entirely expected,” he said by email.
But Mr. Alexander argues that realism led to the unanimous decision by the publishing house’s board to close the stores. Though some operate in the black, and overall sales for UMPH rose last year, the stores’ staffing and other expenses as a group now outpace their sales by $2 million, Mr. Alexander said.
The percentage of UMPH’s revenues coming from the stores has shrunk, and surveys show an increasing number of store customers also shop online.
Mr. Alexander notes UMPH is required by the denomination to stay afloat without getting general church funds. Given that reality, and sales trends, it made sense to shutter the stores and focus instead on online and call-center sales, while also placing more sales representatives in the field.
“There is absolutely no doubt at all that this is the right time to step into the future for our retail ministry,” he said.
The closings will reduce UMPH’s full-time work force from 620 to 475, and 75 part-time workers also are losing jobs. Severance pay ranges from four weeks for recently-hired employees to five months for long-timers, with a bonus for all who stay through their store’s closing.
If the layoffs have been cushioned, the closings themselves have proceeded with military precision. Audrey Kidd, UMPH’s executive vice president for revenue & operations, said the process has more than 120 steps, dealing with everything from employee issues to forwarding phone calls and mail.
The end phase brings “store closing” banners and discounts escalating to 90 percent the final week. The goal is to sell or donate everything but store computers, which return to UMPH headquarters in Nashville.
Sign removal is done by specialty firms, and they work fast.
The consequences of the store closings have already been felt, not least by 19 seminaries that have depended on their campus Cokesbury to provide books for students and faculty.
Iliff School of Theology in Denver plans to link to Cokesbury.com through the school website, but Asbury Theological Seminary in Wilmore, Ky., is finalizing a contract with another bookstore company.
Wesley Theological Seminary in Washington, D.C., will be directing students to online bookseller Amazon.com, since many already were using it, said registrar Eleanor Gease. Garrett-Evangelical Theological Seminary, in Evanston, Ill., has established a partnership with the Barnes & Noble bookstore at nearby Northwestern University.
Critics of the decision to close Cokesbury stores have warned that it will sever the relationship with clergy that forms in seminary days; but Mr. Alexander is not particularly troubled that some seminaries are going with other firms.
“Students at all of the schools we’ve served in the last decade have already had multiple avenues for obtaining textbooks,” he said.
The most obvious immediate impact of the store closings is on employees. Of the Dallas store’s five-person staff, only Ms. Chapman will be kept on. She’ll be a Cokesbury “community resource consultant,” based in the Norfolk, Va., area (where she’s lived before) and assigned to visit churches and annual conferences.
Ms. Chapman, based on meetings in Nashville, believes the new strategy has great promise, allowing for a focus on meeting churches’ specific ministry needs.
But she worries about her about-to-be-laid-off staff—and about her store customers.
Cokesbury stores have been a gathering place for clergy and committed laity, she said.
UMPH has encouraged any farewell observances store employees or others want to have, and is offering to sponsor a dinner or luncheon for employees.
Iliff had a March 1 reception for employees of its campus store, as well as the Denver store.
At the Kansas City area store, employees spent the last day, March 2, greeting loyal customers, including the Rev. Diane Cutler of Stover, Mo., who made her final 200-mile round-trip there. That night employees consoled themselves at a popular steakhouse.
Employees at the Seattle area Cokesbury also had a farewell restaurant meal. But they gathered yet another time, once the store was emptied of furnishings.
“We had a picnic on the floor,” said Mr. Palo.
Mr. Palo is sad about the closings, and not just because he’s out of work. As a seminary student, he joyfully discovered in Cokesbury a rare Christian bookstore that carried a range of theological works, many quite challenging.
He also loved working at Cokesbury, and recalls that his touts of The Alto Wore Tweed, a wry church-based novel by Mark Schweizer, helped it outsell best-seller The Shack in the Seattle area store.
But Mr. Palo is philosophical, noting the trend away from bookstore sales.
Others are not resigned. Among them is Bonnie Oplinger, a student at Lancaster Theological Seminary in Lancaster, Pa., where the Cokesbury store will close on April 13.
Ms. Oplinger said the manager, Lance Mullins, “brought customer service to an art form.” She’s sure her life, not to mention her scholarship, will be poorer without a Cokesbury nearby.

"2 bookworms capitalize on a novel idea: putting the library online and book rentals in the mailbox.
College friends George Burke and Shamoon Siddiqui spent a lot of time in bookstores reading books but not buying them. They didn't have room to store all the books and didn't necessarily want to own every book they read. Then they thought, why not rent books Netflix-style?
In 2006, after Burke had sold a web design company and Siddiqui had completed his master's degree in computer engineering, they launched BookSwim using personal savings and book donations. By April 2007, they had their first customer.
Not everyone was enthusiastic, though. Bloggers said, ""These guys are trying to take over the library."" Others described the idea as ""extremely ambitious"" and even ""insane."" But ""most libraries close at 6 p.m.,"" says Burke, ""and not everyone lives near a library.""
To make sure their idea would work, Burke and Siddiqui did some grass-roots market research. ""Anywhere we saw someone with a book, we whipped out a questionnaire,"" explains Siddiqui, who adds that they felt vindicated when ""one of the first customers was a librarian.""
For a flat monthly fee (starting at $14.99), subscribers can pick from 200,000 titles on the website. The 20-employee company keeps about 15 percent of its inventory in a warehouse, which started out in Siddiqui's basement. The rest of the books are ordered on demand. Most inventory comes from distributors, but as volume increases, publishers are starting to approach them directly. Since launching BookSwim, the pair has greatly increased the number of books they purchase daily, and company growth is more than tripling monthly.",en,web

"After months of work on his score for Undergound (1928), Neil Brand is still, happily, a big fan of the film. In fact he’s enthusiastic, and generous, enough to offer Silent London a preview of the music ahead of the world premiere next Wednesday and to chat about the film, and the process of scoring it too. Anthony Asquith’s film is set in London, but borrows its visual style from the European and Soviet art cinema that he loved so much: expect dark shadows, quickfire editing and geometric compositions. “Asquith was never again so bold as he was with Underground,” Brand says, and this score represents Brand’s attempt “to make music as bold as the film is”.
It hasn’t been an easy task. At first, he says, he was intimidated by the task ahead: the difficulty about writing for Underground, as opposed to Blackmail, which Brand scored for the BBC Symphony Orchestra last year, was that Asquith’s film requires snatches of lighter music. Blackmail is like an “icicle to the heart”, but Underground has wry, comic moments, at least towards the beginning of the film, before the characters make some disastrous decisions, and the film’s romantic triangle becomes an “Expressionist nightmare”. “Those first 20 minutes were horrendous to write,” he says. But four months later he has a complete score, which will be played by the BBC Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Timothy Brock, at the Barbican Concert Hall next month.
Other than that though, Brand tackled the score as he always does, from the beginning to the end. This means that every morning, before starting work on the next segment of the film he would play through the existing score from the start. So he has heard the opening of the score, on his home computer setup, many, many times.
And what an opening it is. I was listening to a computer simulation of the orchestral score, with the film running in a tiny 3in window in the corner of the screen. Luckily, the music speaks volumes, with sweeping harps and chiming bells that immediately tell us we’re in London town. These first minutes play like a short overture, running through the changing moods of the whole film. The love theme makes an early appearance as the title of the film is revealed, but sharply gives way to chase music as the camera plunges down to the subterranean tunnel and races into the tube station. Before we know it we have come to a comic scene, as commuters jostle for seats, and flirt a little too. This is a moment when the film pauses to enjoy a touch of comedy, and the score offers a hint of a hornpipe as a sailor saunters into the carriage, for example.
But the tone isn’t always so light-hearted. Brand uses the full force of the string section to create shimmering, celebrational music as characters … use an escalator. But it’s more than that, of course. Asquith shoots the escalator and the crowd, from a low angle, creating grandeur, giving Brand the opportunity to match the feeling of awe with his music.
The score can be character-led too. When we first meet Kate, the spikiest corner of Underground’s love triangle, low notes on a cor anglais strike a sinister tone. “All music has to have an opinion,” says Brand, and the score does sometimes tell the audience what to think. Here, we know that Kate is set on a tragic course – and that she is a troubled young woman. Later, as her actions come back to haunt her, she is accompanied by harp, deep piano and vibraphone playing snatches of themes from earlier in the film, with random pizzicato to represent her distracted, anguished, state of mind.
That’s Underground: humour, romance, action, melodrama and fear. “Asquith isn’t interested in a homogenous feel,” says Brand. He feels that his task when writing the score was to emphasise each of these changing moods fully, in order to do justice to the film, and that means that the score, too, has to turn on a sixpence.
Brand shows me the edits in one bar-room fight sequence to illustrate the point: eight shots in 12 seconds, including a fist coming right at the camera. “It’s a lovely challenge for me,” he laughs. Each new shot is marked on Brock’s copy of the score, alongside the usual musical notation – and there are at least 70 non-musical cues such as bus bells, door knocks and a cymbal-hit as one character flicks another’s collar. Brock, and his 85-piece orchestra, have to meet all of them on the dot, or the picture and the score will seem to be out of synch.
There is no “synch”, though. It’s all an illusion, created by Brand’s score, Brock’s conducting and a hugely talented – and huge – orchestra. Underground promises to be spectacular.
Underground screens with the BBC Symphony Orchestra at the Barbican Concert Hall on 5 October at 8pm. The film will be followed by a panel discussion, chaired by Francine Stock and featuring Neil Brand, Matthew Sweet and Robin Baker from the BFI archive. You can buy tickets here, on the Barbican website.",en,web

"A woman was caught on surveillance video stealing mail from dozens of Santa Clara residents, and postal inspectors say it's just a matter of time before the suspect strikes again in the South Bay.
The suspect used a key to open a cluster of mailboxes outside the Talavera housing development in Santa Clara. The surveillance footage shows the suspect calmly approaching the mailboxes just after 3 a.m. then calmly using a key to open the large access door to the mailbox bank. In about 3 minutes, she gathers a significant bundle of mail.
""She tried two keys,"" resident Jitendra Gore said. ""She took mail and a lot of packages.""
The woman made two trips to load all the stolen mail into a waiting car.
Surveillance video captures a woman opening up mailbox banks at an apartment complex in Santa Clara and making off with bundles of mail.
""Totally violated,"" Gore said when asked how it made her feel. ""To see someone pull your letters and packages, it's really a feeling of violation somebody's doing that.""
U.S. Postal Inspector Jeff Fitch met with the victims Wednesday.
Investigators have seen an increase in cluster box break-ins statewide, Fitch said, and he believes the suspect will strike again because a counterfeit key could provide access to other cluster boxes in the same postal zone.
""The individuals behind this will likely be hitting other cities in the South Bay,"" he said.
The homeowners association had just installed new surveillance cameras Sunday.

“Kids: ALIVE!” is a comedy/Improv class and show for kids, by kids!! It’s a unique experience for your child. A weekend full of classes, instruction, and creativity that ends with a live show. “Kids: ALIVE!” is different from other comedy or Improv classes for children. It doesn’t follow a strict structure, or force your child to do things our way. Our focus is to see what they do best. Let the kids be themselves. Some right funny jokes; they’ll tell jokes. Some are great at Improv; They’ll do Improv. Whatever works for them. The point is, NOT ALL PERFORMERS ARE THE SAME. We give each child the freedom to do their thing. See what they can bring to the table. Then, we put it all together in to a live show and let your kids hit the stage. Almost all the material is created by the kids, so naturally, kids love the show. It’s a comedy show by kids, for kids.
The first half of the day is all about discovery. The kids meet each other. They meet Lenny. They also meet Lenny’s daughters. Both girls have been acting and working with Lenny for most of the last ten years. They know this class backwards and forwards. Through a number of improve games, the kids learn to work as a team. As they do that. Lenny can begin to see your Childs strengths. The second half of the day is focused more on individual work. Whether it’s stories, sketches, “Top-Ten lists”, or jokes, we’ll see what your child is best at. This helps narrow in on what the students will do for the show. The day ends with more group work to keep the kids focused on working with each other. Everyone goes home with one thing to prepare for the show on their own.
Doors open at 4:30pm. Show starts at 5 sharp. Sit back, watch and laugh as your child takes center stage and becomes the star. It’s time for “Kids: ALIVE”.",en,web

"When you visited Google in Australia this week, you probably noticed some colourful, familar faces staring back at you! It wasn't until I put my cursor over the Google Doodle (Google Logo) that I found out it was a tribute to Sesame Street's 40th Anniversary.
For those who have been hiding under a rock, Sesame Street is an American Children's TV series that premiered on 10 November 1969 and is the longest running children's program on US television. The show is produced in the United States by the non-profit organisation Sesame Workshop, formerly known as the Children’s Television Workshop (CTW), founded by Joan Ganz Cooney and Ralph Rogers. It's a sophisticated children's program that combines education and entertainment. Even celebrities have enjoyed guest appearances on Sesame Street over the time (more than 250). With 122 Emmy Awards and shows in more than 140 countries, it has such a long history.
I have such fond memories of Sesame Street when growing up, who could not forget the wonderful and warm Sesame Street muppet characters, created by Jim Henson. Some of my favourites were Big Bird, Snuffleupagus, Cookie Monster, Elmo, Bert and Ernie, Oscar and Telly Monster. I'm talking about wathcing Sesame Street in in the 1980's though! There's so many new characters now of course for new generations to enjoy.
When I first started work with Jodie Parker of Iceberg Events (the events company that look after Networx Brisbane), the computers networked on the server were named after Sesame Street characters. I thought it was the coolest thing. Years later and as the old computers were replaced, we actually ran out of characters that we remembered (and cared for) from Sesame Street, so we then started on Jim Hensen's The Muppet Show. My computer was aptly called Miss Piggy (because of my constant snacking). Then we moved to our commercial office space in Milton (Brisbane) and then did away with our 'childish' ways (sigh). (Besides, it got a little too confusing trying to remember all the names!).
So back to my joy when I see that that Google pays tribute to Sesame Street's 40th anniversary with more than one Google Doodle!
These special Google logos were designed by Dennis Hwang and you can find the complete list of holiday and event Google Doodles here, including the Sesame Street logos that featured in other countries.",en,web

"Max Gradel is set for a few more hair-raising moments before Leeds discover their destiny.
The flamboyant winger from Ivory Coast has pledged to dye his hair in the club colours of blue, white and yellow if they make the Premier League.
Gradel’s two goals made sure Leeds still have every chance of doing that.
But his manager Simon Grayson is more likely to be tearing his hair out if they keep defending as they did ­yesterday.
Having dominated the first half and taken a deserved lead through a ­wonderful early Gradel strike, Leeds somehow conceded either side of the break to Billy Sharp and Franck ­Moussa to trail 2-1 by the 49th minute.
Moussa’s effort was the 10th goal Leeds had conceded in four games.
But Grayson’s men found a way back. And for that, he owes a big thank you to Jonathan Howson.
When they needed him ­yesterday, Howson came up with a vital equaliser within a minute of Moussa’s goal, ­dispossessing Doncaster’s Brian Stock and charging ­forward to drive in a goal that raised the roof.
And, after goals from Luciano ­ Becchio and Gradel had put Leeds into a comfortable 4-2 lead, Howson strode through to finish the job in the closing minutes.
Grayson said: “The game should have been over by half-time and it might have been if we had been a little ­ luckier and a little more clinical.
Gradel’s willingness to run at ­defenders caused Doncaster problems all afternoon.
On 12 minutes, Sam Hird should have intercepted Howson’s pass but Gradel did the rest – surging ­forward before steering a lovely shot into the ­bottom corner.
Right on half-time, they were ­punished as Sharp got in between ­centre-backs Leigh Bromby and Andy O’Brien to finish at the second attempt.
Within four ­ minutes of the restart, Moussa ran through for his first ­Doncaster goal ­after his loan move from Leicester.
Howson equalised straight away and Leeds regained control.
Becchio slammed in Bromby’s ­knockdown for his 17th goal of the ­season to make it 3-2.
And Gradel turned in a Robert ­Snodgrass cross after Billy ­Paynter had been denied on the near post.",en,web

"The umbrella body of Ijaw youths in a statement by its Spokesman, Daniel Dasimaka, describes President Buhari’s victory as a testament of the level of acceptance he enjoyed in different parts of the country.
He, however, urged the President to reward the efforts and support he received from the Niger Delta by developing the region in his second term in office.
Prior to the election, Dasimaka issued a controversial IYC statement endorsing the candidature of Buhari and gave reasons why the region should vote for him.
Dasimaka said beyond the endorsement, the like minds in IYC worked to garner votes for the President following their conviction that he meant well for the region.
He said: “We congratulate President Muhammadu Buhari and urge him to treat his victory as a victory for all Nigerians and to see the entire country including regions and state where he did not win as his constituency.",en,web
"Northrop Grumman Corp., the world's largest builder of warships, said Thursday that it would team with Raytheon Co. to design a new stealth ship for the Navy four months after Northrop's own bid for the project was rejected.
Century City-based Northrop will contribute its shipbuilding knowledge as Raytheon designs the littoral combat ship, a new class of small, fast vessels capable of fighting in shallow coastal waters, Raytheon said. Raytheon has no shipyards of its own.
In July, seven-month design contracts went to Raytheon, Lockheed Martin Corp. and General Dynamics Corp. in what analysts have said was the Navy's bid for fresh ideas. Being left off the list was the first loss for Northrop since it became the biggest Navy ship contractor as a result of $8 billion in shipyard acquisitions in 2001 and 2002.
The Navy plans to spend $4 billion through fiscal 2009 to research, develop and build the first nine littoral combat ships and is considering a program to build as many as 60 of them.
Northrop can use its knowledge of carbon-fiber composite materials to help Raytheon design lighter ships, Raytheon spokesman Steve Brecken said.
Shares of Waltham, Mass.-based Raytheon fell 22 cents to $27.24, and Northrop rose 91 cents to $92.78, both on the New York Stock Exchange.",en,web

37signals Co-Founder’s talk about “executing the basics flawlessly” and “learning to charge at the start” was free of the jargon that convolutes business conversations and writing. The lessons that Jason offers on making, writing and hiring reflect the timeless qualities of simplicity, brevity and curiosity. Best of all, they are expressed in a plain way that is refreshing. Jason’s clear-cut presentation reminded me of the clear-cut principles in the book Why Business People Speak Like Idiots: A Bullfighter’s Guide.

One overly abused statement is “Print is Dead.” Design blog and studio Swissmiss asked her readers for recommendations to do a small run of letterpress cards. The answers shout big admiration for the beautiful process and effect of printing. Communities like Briar Press help ensure that letterpress-era equipment and the art of fine printing remain preserved and open.

Before the digital computer OS, there was mathematician, philosopher and mechanical engineer Charles Babbage’s Difference Engine, the first mechanical calculator. Its impressive function of 8,000 moving parts matches its appealing form. Then there is the timely connection with the world’s first woman programmer Ada Lovelace. Not simply based on a true story, it indeed is a true story, one of mechanical beauty, by design.
Speaking of mechanical beauty, musician and luthier James Trussart has pushed the guitar-envelope. His custom guitars are made of an unorthodox material in steel. Each takes two laborious weeks to make and only 300 are made. The result is a coveted object whose look and tone are richly tuned.
Tina Roth Eisenberg’s launch of her take on the to-do list further demonstrates the sublime order of typographic elements applied to an interface toward getting things done. It also demonstrates the collaborative potential of people who are close by. The webapp was co-developed by Cameron Koczon who is Tina’s studio mate.

"Travis W. Thompson of Sideman & Bancroft LLP said that as early as law school he realized the value of networking and being active in the American Bar Association Section of Taxation, particularly for young attorneys.
Thompson said attending the ABA meetings offered the opportunity “to hear panels on some of the most wide-ranging topics in the tax world,” so he listened carefully, took notes, and did some more research on where the industry was moving.
That led Thompson to start diving into the use of AI and big data in the IRS’s tax enforcement efforts, and he decided to become a subject matter expert on the topic. Thompson said he soon enrolled in a Massachusetts Institute of Technology course on AI and businesses, and before long began presenting on it.
“In the last year, I’ve done more press and more speaking engagements than my previous five years combined,” Thompson said.",en,web

"In the Book of Galatians, Paul explains how the Christian should live his life. Paul, by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, reasons that if a Christian is saved by faith, should he not continue to live by that same faith? Should his walk and conduct not be characterized by a dependence on God and the seeking of God’s direction and will? Paul reasons at length that these things should be so, but as he brings his explanation to a conclusion he further instructs us that the life of the Christian who lives in submission to God will be characterized by certain qualities. These qualities are described by Paul as “The Fruit of the Spirit.” They are enumerated in Galatians 5:22.
Perhaps the first thing that must be noted in any consideration of the fruit of the Spirit is that it is different than the better known “gifts of the Spirit,” which we find in such passages as 1 Corinthians 12 and Romans 12. The spiritual gifts are functions and capacities which are given to Christians to enable them to serve in the church. Not all Christians have the same gifts. However, the fruit of which Paul speaks in Galatians is the manifestation of the Holy Spirit’s work in a person yielded to Him. This fruit should be found in its fullness and entirety in every believer.
A Christian whose life isn’t described by the fruit of the Spirit is likely walking far from God or perhaps has never truly been born again.
It is unfortunate that an overemphasis on gifts has led many Christians to neglect the virtues of the Spirit. Surely the development of Christian character should take precedence over displaying special abilities.
In considering the fruit of the Spirit, it is important to notice that Paul uses the singular form of the noun (i.e. “fruit” instead of “fruits”). This indicates the unity and the interconnectedness of the various virtues composing the fruit. As one grows in love, for example, then of necessity he will also grow in kindness, longsuffering, etc. It is impossible to demonstrate true Christian love and yet be unkind. In fact, as we will show in the associated articles, every one of the aspects of the fruit of the Spirit is an outworking of Christian love as described in 1 Corinthians 13.
Along those same lines, the fruit of the Spirit is a necessary consequence of spiritual life. Just as in the natural world a tree that doesn’t produce fruit is either immature or is dead, so it is in the spiritual world. A Christian whose life isn’t described by the fruit of the Spirit is likely walking far from God or perhaps has never truly been born again.
I am a missionary to Honduras, Central America. When I first came to Honduras about thirty years ago, we lived in an area with an abundance of mango trees and orange trees. One unusual thing about these trees almost immediately caught my eye. Most of the fruit trees had slash marks made by a machete on the trunks. I asked a friend as to why the people slash their fruit trees and he told me that it was so that the tree would produce more fruit. The explanation seemed rather implausible to me but later I talked to an arborist and he informed me that it was indeed so. He said that when a tree is stressed it often produces a more abundant crop.
I think there may be a spiritual lesson here, something illustrative of the fruit of the Spirit. You see, when a Christian passes through difficult trials it is at these very times that the fruit of the Spirit in his life will be demonstrated most clearly and noticeably. When others are worried, the Christian will have peace. When others are angry, the Christian will show love. When others are troubled, the Christian will have joy.
So how do you have the fruit of the Spirit? The answer is simple. It is to live in the Spirit. It is to set aside one’s own feelings and desires and rather seek that God may guide you moment by moment.
The Holy Spirit is often compared to water in the Scriptures (Ezekiel 47:4-5; John 4:14; 7:37-39). Just as a river is life-giving and refreshing, so is the Holy Spirit. Have you ever noticed that along the banks of a stream the vegetation is always abundant and luxurious, even in arid or drought-prone areas? Just as strong and sturdy trees grow along a river’s bank, in the same way as the Holy Spirit flows freely in our lives, a rich and beautiful character grows. That character is not dependent on the circumstances of the moment but is invigorated and sustained by the Holy Spirit Himself.
Perhaps it is fitting to close this introductory discussion of the fruit of the Spirit by citing a passage from the book of Jeremiah (17:7-8). Just as Paul in Galatians argues that the Christian should live by faith and thus have a fruitful life, Jeremiah declares the blessedness of the man who trusts the Lord.
May you indeed be fruitful in your walk with God!",en,books

"2019 is a new start for my Monthly Reviews, the last ones I did was in 2017 and I didn’t want to do them every year so 2 years seem a good wait. I didn’t do one in January as the month was nearly over before I had my list of 10 reviews to do.
April – Beer House, I believe this was Sheffield 1st micro pub and now we have a few more so here we go .. they have 6 cask and 4 keg lines, the cask is ever changing.
1. Introduce yourself and tell everyone who you are ? tell us something we probably wont know ?
I’m John Harrison, one half of The Beer House. Ex teacher, football and cricket fan you probably wouldn’t know that I’m a qualified therapist who is trained to hypnotise people!
2. What made you choose the venue where you are now on Eccy Road, with the appearance of other micro pubs it has turned out nice, did you consider any other places ?
Times 12-11, 7 days a week. We have been open for over 800 days without closing (Xmas day 12-3, that counts!) We closed the first couple of Xmas days but in over 4 years we have closed 2 days total. We are always open on the hours advertised as I hate places closing early if no one around.
4. Do you have any plans to do any meet the breweries or tap takeovers this year ?
No we don’t. I’ve found the MTB events can be good and interesting but really once you’ve been to one you’ve seen it all, sometimes trying to get a word in with the Brewers can feel like a teenager at a concert as people crowd around which I find a bit weird. The Takeovers are more hassle than their worth with having to cap ales to change the offerings. We pride ourselves on having a consistent line up of great cask ales that change daily anyways so every day there is something new to come in for. Personally if I go in a pub and the taps are all one brewery I’m more annoyed than enthused. I honestly can’t think of a brewery that does 6-9 amazing beers. You always end up with a 9% brown ale on in a takeover or 4 stouts. I prefer to have a range to choose from when I go into somewhere to drink.
5. Besides ales what other drinks do you sell ?, gins etc etc, do you stock non alcoholic drinks ? snacks ?
I think we have the best wine list in the city. All sourced from far and wide so not stocked anywhere else. We have over 30 wines, 16 by the glass. We stock around 15 gins from Starmoreboss (as do most micropubs now) we stock juices and general non alcoholic drinks as well as bitburger drive which I think is the best non booze beer. We stocked several but demand just wasn’t there. In January you can bring your own alcohol free beer in as long as make a donation to St Luke’s in the bucket.
Snacks we have cheese boards from Porter Brook deli and pork pies from wateralls as well as fresh sausage rolls daily from perfectionary so we can’t really improve on that! Sunday is quiche day also. We also sell crisps, nuts, and jalopeno pretzels etc.
6. Now time to think back, what was your first ever ale you had and which pub was it in ?, also is the pub still there.
Not sure I can remember my first but do remember Farmers blonde in the sheaf view as the game changer. I think I’d been drinking pish like tetleys etc since then. I can’t believe I loved it so much back then, when I have it now (as nowt else on) it just reminds me of bath water. We fondly call it Farmers bland now.
7. Which are your favourite top 3 breweries and why ?
2 Bristol beer factory- every new beer is excellent.
The sheaf view- good selection and I like neepsend plus the pub holds a lot of memories for me.
Struggling for a 3rd as I’m too picky about beer and too many pubs do it badly. I’d say the Cross on Derbyshire lane as I think Ash is great there and they have a dart board and billiards but I generally have to drink Keg as Thornbridge don’t give the pub and decent cask.
9. A question I asked in 2017 to some and will be asking this to everyone this year and see if any of them happen, so what do you think will be making the headlines in Sheffield in 2019/20 beer wise ?
More bars in kelham island? So many bars you can see them from space! Although my favourite is Bar Stewards as Charlie and Al are great and they know great beer. They would have been my favourites but I’m not down that part of town enough. Trends are hard to predict but I’d say more micropubs and more breweries selling out to the big boys! Not sure many Sheffield ones will be bought up though as we are still behind in the style and marketing of most of the emerged breweries that have gone big.",en,books

Of course, if you don't play, owning this chess set is a reason to learn if we ever heard one. We can find no other logical alternative.

"Kick Nurse set out to be an un-cliched thing and in the process have become one. They are from Brighton and make lovely little toe tapping melodies broadly under the genres of no-wave / math rock / krautrock. Mark Roberts recorded the first EP Horse Conduit; what a nice man.
Kick Nurse creates chaotic poly-rhythmic music which I can best describe as hypnotic feverish dreams or insanity driven hallucinations. What I really like about their music is that even in the more structured parts, it is still off-beat or has a little weird twist to it, just to make your feel just a little awkward. This is music that demands full focus, because of all the layers, that seems to be going off in all directions, in a disorientated ordered way.
The anguished introverted vocal performance from Oli just boosts the maddening feeling I get, the longer I listen to the Horse Conduit EP. The recording is crisp and allows you to enjoy each instrument to the fullest. You can’t listen to this only once, as each instrument offers each their own history and you simply can’t get the full scope of the layers in one listen-through. I still discover new passages in their compositions, so I’m not done with this EP yet.
The seemingly free-form-fusion composition does however, in it’s totally unpredictability, still invite to both head-nodding and feet-tapping and a strange hypnotic way. And as a big bass-fetishist I get my needs satisfied in the hauntingly good ’Swish Amish Knife’.
I can highly recommend Horse Conduit to anyone that likes their music a little off-beat and demanding.",en,books
"Cuba is an intricate and exciting time capsule that is now yours to explore in a way some never imagined possible. With its rich culture, inspiring history and culinary delights that would make even the most seasoned travelers swoon, Cuba is like no other. Our mysterious and enchanting Caribbean neighbor to the south is a romantic adventure whose time has finally come.
An unprecedented city, old and new, unique and unusual. Unlike many cities, Havana understands how to preserve its architectural heritage and its colonial past. The famous Old Havana, where the city began more than five centuries ago, is one of the best preserved architectural ensembles of the Americas. The blend between African and Spanish footprints makes it one of the most unique cities in Latin America. It is also a fountain of inspiration for poets and musicians alike. This city a must-see when discovering Cuba and all its splendor.
As the most Caribbean city in Cuba, Santiago de Cuba is known for its fusion of cultures, a mixture of Spanish, African, French, Haitian and West Indian. The singular beauty of Santiago's landscapes, the nearby sea and mountains, the lively atmosphere, and its friendly inhabitants are characteristics which distinguish the city and make it one of Cuba's most desirable destinations.
As you walk in the footsteps of Christopher Columbus and his entrance into the New World, you'll see for yourself why he believed that it was ""the most beautiful land human eyes had ever seen"". The city has a history of more than five centuries and some of the most picturesque scenes Cuba has to offer.
Famous as the land that produces the world's best tobacco, Pinar del Rio offers a landscape of unusual and incomparable beauty, from the highest mountains to the sea floor. This stunning region is characterized by its valleys, mountains, caves, rivers, cliffs and fertile land. Due to all its natural splendor, Pinar del Rio is known as Cuba's Natural Cathedral.
Nicknamed the Pearl of the South after its magnificent bay, Cienfuegos is considered to be the architectural jewel of the nineteenth century. The city's ports are bathed by the Caribbean Sea and a beautiful bay. It is also rich in palaces, parks, theaters, churches and a promenade that extends almost to the sea and is a daily meeting point for visitors and inhabitants alike.
Since its birth, Matanzas has been known as ""The Venice of Cuba"" because of its many bridges and as ""The Athens of Cuba"" because of its many poets. It also proudly boasts one of the best beaches in the world: Varadero, a masterpiece of nature. The fine white sand and warm transparent waters makes it one of the most important and recognized beaches in the world.
The charm of this city can be found in its unique combination of Spanish and Arabic architecture characterized by winding narrow streets and alleys. Step outside the city and you'll find breathtaking beaches of white sand and transparent waters.

"On December 5, Ontario Region staff attended the Social Policy Committee Meeting at Queen’s Park. The Committee considered amendments as they went through clause-by-clause of Bill 7, the Promoting Affordable Housing Act.
As noted last week, Managing Director Harvey Cooper made a deputation to the Committee. The deputation focused on Inclusionary Zoning (IZ), the most significant feature of the legislation. IZ would allow municipalities to create a by-law to get affordable housing units built when housing developments are approved.
Being able to produce affordable housing units off-site makes co‑op housing development far more possible under Inclusionary Zoning. For more info, you can read CHF Canada’s Submission to the Committee.
Bill 7 was passed by the Committee, went to the Legislature for third reading, and passed just moments ago!",en,web

"Did everyone have a good 4th of July weekend? I certainly did! As I mentioned at the end of my last post, my family and I headed to the Branson area of southern Missouri last week to visit my parents. We’ve been parked there since last Tuesday but will be moving on to the fields of Iowa this week.
**This was to have been posted on Tuesday, but because my parents live in the sticks and it was raining, we had no wifi. Gasp! So here it is, two days late.
I had some major swim/bike/run plans in my head for when we were here. Nothing was going to get in the way of my Ironman training. Until we got here and started to relax.
The first day we were here, we slept in. It was glorious, especially considering we had gotten up at 4 am the day before. But the road was calling and I wanted to get some hill running in. When I say hills, I mean HILLZ. Steep friggin hillZ. We took off and within one mile, I was heaving up a big hill, ready to throw in the towel and give up. It was almost as humid as in Wilmington, which I certainly wasn’t expecting. Seven point three of some of the most miserable miles later, I was done. I had wanted to go ten miles, but I didn’t have enough liquid left in my body to be able to sweat it out. I figured some of the fatigue was due to the 100 mile bike ride and heavy training week the week before that, but I was really pissed off slightly irritated about not having a good run.
The towel was SOAKED when I got done.
The next day, I went to the local gym and hopped on a bike. Five minutes later, I was drenched in sweat, dreading the remaining hour. Here’s a suggestion to every gym everywhere: USE FANS. No one wants to work out in a pool of their own sweat. It was so gross. After that suffer fest, I hopped on the treadmill for a mile or two. Funny, there were fans on the treadmills so I cranked those babies up and the run ended up being relatively comfortable, and I ended up going 3.1 miles. Not too shabby. I’d planned to swim whenever I could, but with the weird weather and pop up storms, we ended up at the pool that day. No swimming for me.
The next day, we all headed out on the lake. Table Rock Lake is absolutely gorgeous. It’s less clear than last year, due to all the rain they’ve been having, but it’s still very clear, especially compared to what I normally swim in. I had my cap and goggles, and when we got anchored in a nice little cove, I took off to swim. Evidently the plethora of shark attacks off MY coast has gotten to my head, because I kept seeing big huge sea monsters on the bottom coming up to get me. I was freaked out, to say the least. Then I saw a pretty big log sticking up from the bottom and in my mind, it literally was a sea monster coming up to get me, and I actually freaked out. I did the exact same thing as when I saw all those jelly fish (stop, dog paddle like mad, and gasp for breath), but this time, it was worse. I tried three times to get myself started and saw sea monsters logs on the bottom, and three times, I totally freaked out. I swam back to the boat, shaking. WTF was this all about? I’m a tough girl who doesn’t freak out about things like this, especially dead logs that have been there for eons, but I was scared. I decided to just stop, and try again another day.
On July 4th, my husband and I were signed up to run the Firecracker 5000. Well, I was; he was signed up for the 10k. We got up super early (compared to the late mornings we’d had so far), got ready, and headed to the race. We laughed at the timer chips that were to be secured on our shoes with “bread bag” twisty ties.
Must be the new “thing” in timing chips. But it held strong!
There were probably 600 total runners, the shirts were very nice, and packet pickup was easy since we got there early. We warmed up about half a mile, found the can, and lined up.
The race started a few minutes late, but we took off in the middle of Branson Landing, a cute little shopping area. The bad thing is that they didn’t even play the national anthem before the race, something they should have made sure to do on that important day.
I fought some traffic as we started, but soon, it thinned out and I was on my way. I wasn’t sure what pace I wanted to keep, and soon, I figured I needed to just GO and not worry about what pace I was going. We ran along the Taneycomo Lake, which is a very cold lake, which made for some very nice cool air as we ran along, probably ten degrees cooler than even twenty feet away from it. Crazy. We wound around a campground and neighborhood, and I felt my pace was holding pretty good at 7:20ish. I ALWAYS slow down during the second mile, but felt I was doing well and would have a good finish. We backtracked towards the landing again, ran past it, and wound around the parking lot, which was annoying, but heard the course had to be made up that morning due to flooding on other parts of the course. Oh well, I knew the end was near!
I crossed the finish line at 22:01. Whew, I was happy with that, even though I think the course was a teeny bit short. I walked with my water to catch my breath, hid it by White House Black Market, and jogged backwards along the course to find my husband and get some more miles in, of course near the lake where it was nice and cool. I found my hubs and he was going along at a good pace, so I cut through and waited for him at the finish line. He finished in 50:36, which is a new PR for him since he hasn’t run a 10k in forever. Whohoo!
We cooled down as much as we could and waited for the awards. In the meantime, tons of door prizes were awarded, some of them being big packs of fireworks, the kind that are as tall as I am. How cool is that?! Tons of kids were called to get some mini packs, big packs, and plenty of big kids won them, too. I was happy to win first place in my age group and got a cool gold medal to bring home. We changed into dryer clothes and walked around, finding some little trinkets to bring home.
When we got back, we got headed to the lake, unbeknownst to us this would be our only nice lake day. It was great! We relaxed, drank, cannonballed, floated, and hung out. Perfect. Then it was back to the house for food, back to the lake for fireworks, then back to the house again for our own firework show.
Boats piling up to watch the firework show.
There were so many going off all over and echoing in the hills, it was like what I imagine Beirut is like except we were having fun. I love those little novelty fireworks, like tanks, fire trucks, the parachute ones, and fountains. The boys loved everything else. We had a blast (pun totally intended).
My dad and the kids with our show stoppers.
The next day, we slept in til about 9:00, which is so unusual for us, but with the dark and quiet room, soooo nice! We couldn’t really do much outside due to the strange storms, but we hung out and relaxed.
On Monday, I ended up running 6 miles of hillz again, and then we all headed to the shooting range for a gun safety class and some guns! I have to admit, I’m not a gun person. I have never really been around them, but I’m definitely not against them. My dad has been collecting interesting sorts of guns for several years, and wanted to teach my boys about guns in a safe way. They loved it! I loved it! We all loved it! Feeling the power of a gun going off in my hand was, oh, let’s say it was scary in a good way. If that makes any sense. After over two hours of shooting various rifles and a 9 mm, we headed to lunch and then the boat.
Wait, crappy weather again so the pool. Wait, storm popped up so once again, we were trapped in the house for the evening. We played some games on the deck as we listened to more thunder and rain. My husband and I ended up going to have a few drinks at a total dive biker bar and picked up some fried green beans on the way home. I love those things.
Every time we went out, it was like this.
I was planning to get a swim in on Tuesday. Since I was a little freaked out, I needed to face my fears anyway, so figured I could go to the campground swim area that’s right around the corner from here. Nope, torrential rain with no sign of ending. So I went back to the house of sweat (the gym) and thankfully, this time it was a little “less hot”. I went an hour and 20 minutes hard on the bike and then did some strength on the machines. My husband was desperately trying to get internet connection, but was finding the equivalent of 12k dial up, so I didn’t get any treadmill running in this time. We headed back to my parent’s house. My mom and I took the kids for a walk around the campground during a rain lull, and of course, it started raining again before we were done. Damn. Everything was starting to flood and the lake level was rising, which is crazy since the lake is ginormous.
This was the norm for the entire week we were there.
On Wednesday, we will be heading north to Des Moines, Iowa, and I’m planning to meet up with Kickass Kecia from Push My Limits sometime on Wednesday afternoon, assuming our travels go as planned. We are then going to Field of Dreams so my kids can say, “Dad, wanna have a catch?”. Then we’re headed to our old stomping ground in Sioux City to visit friends until we head back to Kansas City for our flight home on Tuesday. Whew. I’m tired even typing that. Meanwhile, at home, my yard is dying because there’s no rain and it’s still hotter ‘n a whore in church, my cats are dying from the lack of attention, and it still as hot as the gates of hell. I guess that’s what we’re going to get when we arrive back home. I’m hoping we get just a tiny bit of dryer air in Iowa. Just a little less humidity would be just what the doctor ordered. I can only hope.

From graphic prints to patent leather to fighter planes and Ferrari-inspired designs, Jordan sneakers routinely transcend its basketball roots by refreshing its initial offerings with new looks and color schemes to remain prevalent throughout generations.",en,web

"The Vauxhall Mokka is a practical car with impractical deficiencies. While a lot of interested buyers may get hooked with just one look of this classy car, Mokka buyers may come up with a completely different opinion once they go under the bonnet. This makes Mokka a tentative offering in the growing and highly competitive mini SUV market in the UK.
If there’s one thing Vauxhall did right with the Mokka, it definitely is the model’s styling. The cabin is luxurious at first glance. Exterior-wise, the design of the Mokka is also logical and defined. Drivers will also benefit from great forward visibility in part because of the high seating. Mokka owners will delight knowing that all models have great security features. Euro NCAP gave the car five stars in crash tests. Security feats include stability control, six airbags, and hill descent control.
The Vauxhall Mokka is fortunately one of the more spacious mini SUVs in the market today. Head and legroom are generous in all seats. The boot can also carry well, and it is shaped to maximise loading. The back seats can be folded to improve the size of the boot.
Equipment for the Mokka is more impressive than most other entry level cars. The S version comes with air conditioning, cruise control and DAB Radio. With the higher trim levels, buyers can also get Bluetooth connectivity, climate control, sat-nav and other features.
While the engine performance is adequate for driving around town, they suffer from being inflexible and they don’t quite give the power that other cars in the segment offer. The 1.6 petrol is overshadowed by the 1.4 turbocharged petrol engine. The diesel variant is strong, but may not give a great initial boost. To add to this, the engines can get noisy when pushed hard. Road noise and wind noise can also disturb when the Mokka is driven on open roads. Drivers of the Mokka will be upset with its poor comfort levels. It doesn’t help that the suspension is quite stiff, and while helping minimise rolls in corners, the passengers will feel each bump on the road.
The interior is mostly composed of plastics, but if it’s any consolation, the Mokka has a better, classier interior compared to its top competitors. Although the Mokka gets high ratings with its security feats, the company’s overall reliability history may affect its popularity. Rear and off-the-shoulder visibility can also be problematic because of Mokka’s rear pillars.
Those who are planning to buy their own Vauxhall Mokka should get ready because the price is none too friendly. When running costs and CO2 emissions are weighed against each other, those who are interested in the Mokka will also find that the rates are against them.
The Vauxhall Mokka’s advantages and disadvantages are pretty much square. Practicality, equipment and security are all highlighted in the expense of performance, comfort and running costs. Buyers of the Mokka will definitely have to settle on what features they prioritise, but looking for an alternative may just as well help them settle the dilemma.",en,reference

"EFG Eurobank Ergasias S.A. announces, in accordance with article 19 par. 2 of l. 3556/2007, that it proposes to amend articles 5 & 6 of its Articles of Association by Resolution of the Bank’s General Shareholders Meeting which will convene on Monday 10 January 2011, at 10 a.m., at “Bodossakis Foundation Building (John S. Latsis Hall)”, Amalias Av. 20, Athens,, or should the quorum required by law not be achieved, at the Repeat General Meeting that will take place on Monday, 24 January 2011, at 10 a.m., at “Bodossakis Foundation Building (John S. Latsis Hall)”, Amalias Av. 20, Athens, or any adjournment thereof. The amendment, set out below, should be read in conjunction with the “Information on the Extraordinary General Meeting of 10 January 2011 (including information under art.27 par.3 of c.l.2190/1920)” which has been posted on the Bank’s website www.eurobank.gr.
1. The Bank’s share capital amounts to 2,503,563,899.56 euros and is divided into 896,364,858 shares of which: a) 550,864,858 ordinary shares with voting rights, of a nominal value of 2.82 euros each and b) 345,500,000 preferred shares, without voting rights, issued under l.3723/2008 of a nominal value of 2.75 euros each.
2.60 The above share capital was further increased as a result of the merger of the Bank with the company “DIAS Portfolio Investments S.A.” which was established in 1991, with registered office in Athens and which was dissolved – without liquidation – through its absorption by the Bank, following the merger procedure specified in Articles 69 -77a of L. 2190/1920 in combination with Article 16 of L. 2515/1997 and Articles 1-5 of L. 2166/1993, following the decision of the A’ Repeat Extraordinary General Meeting of the Shareholders of the Bank dated __/__/_____ and the respective decision of the A’ Repeat Extraordinary General Meeting of the Shareholders dated __/__/_____ of the absorbed company.
a) Increase of the share capital by 69,987,530.76 euros which corresponds to the share capital of the absorbed company (96,942,006.32 euros) after the deduction from the latter of the amount of 25,286,867.92 euros, which corresponds to the total nominal value of the 27,485,726 shares of the absorbed company that belonged to the Bank and the amount of 1,667,607.64 euros, which corresponds to the total nominal value of the 1,812,617 shares of the absorbed company that belonged to DIAS.
b) Increase of the share capital, for rounding purposes, by 2,315,242.55 euros, through the capitalization of the equivalent amount of the Bank’s share premium, with a simultaneous change of the nominal value of the share from 2.75 to 2.82 euros.
Thus, following the above merger the share capital of the Bank amounted to 2,503,563,899.56 euros, divided into 896,364,858 shares, of which a) 550,864,858 ordinary shares with voting rights, of a nominal value of 2.82 euros each and b) 345,500,000 preferred shares, without voting rights, issued under l.3723/2008 of a nominal value of 2.75 euros each.
The shares of the Bank are all registered and divided into two categories: a) 550,864,858 are ordinary, voting shares, dematerialized and listed on the Athens Stock Exchange. They are registered in the records of Hellenic Exchanges S.A. (H.E.L.E.X.) and are monitored through entries to those records and b) 345,500,000 shares, issued in accordance with L. 3723/2008, that are privileged, without a voting right, material, non transferable, and cannot be listed in an organized market.",en,web
"A fuel injector is an electronically controlled valve that supplies the engine with pressurized fuel. When driving, the oxygen sensors tell the engine if it is getting too much air, which signals the fuel injectors to give the engine spurts of pressurized fuel. Since fuel injectors are small pieces of equipment (and the part that squirts the fuel is even smaller), any little piece of dirt can clog it. A clogged fuel injector will hurt your vehicle's performance. To avoid misfires, poor emission rating, poor performance, and rough idle have the car's fuel injectors cleaned regularly. For professional fuel injection cleaning services, call 609-641-5226 or visit Brennan's Service Center today.
To maintain maximum visibility (and keep you safe), you should always make sure that your vehicle's headlight bulbs are in good working condition. Although replacing faulty headlight bulbs is a simple and quick process (takes very little time), you need to rely on an experienced auto mechanic to handle your headlight and bulb replacement. This way, you will have quality bulbs installed by experts. Remember, it is a critical part of your car's maintenance and your safety. For all your headlight and bulb replacement needs, call or visit Brennan's Service Center today.
Do you know the oil basics? Did you know that even some auto mechanics do not know the oil basics? In order for your car's engine to do its job properly, it is vital to have clean, fresh oil. The oil used in your car has two primary ingredients: base oil and additives. The base oil allows the motor oil to perform its vital function - lubricating the engine's moving parts to protect them against wear and tear caused by friction. The additives provide additional engine protection by helping to prevent the oil from deteriorating under the engine's extreme temperature conditions. At Brennan's Service Center, we are motor oil experts - we will help you with motor oil basics. Call us at 609-641-5226 or visit our auto repair shop in Egg Harbor Township, NJ 08234 today.
Did you know that regularly changing the oil in your vehicle is one of the simplest, most effective and inexpensive ways to help protect its engine life? Oil lessens wear, reduces friction, and forms a seal between the pistons, rings, and cylinder walls. The oil also helps cool engine parts and even dampens the shock and noise of moving parts. For all your oil change needs, call 609-641-5226 or visit Brennan's Service Center today. We have years of experience helping drivers with oil changes and other auto maintenance needs.
The positive crankcase ventilation (PCV) valve is a very important part of some cars' emissions control systems. This valve, which is usually plugged into a rubber grommet in the valve cover, is a one-way passage for gases to escape from the engine's crankcase. With time, the PCV valve becomes clogged with sludge from the contaminants in the exhaust gases. If your car has a PCV valve, make sure it is regularly cleaned and (if necessary) replaced. To have your car's PCV valve changed by experts, call or visit Brennan's Service Center in Egg Harbor Township, NJ 08234 today.
Power steering fluid is the hydraulic fluid that transmits the power in a steering wheel. Servicing the power steering involves flushing out the old power steering fluid and adding fresh fluid. A power steering flush will definitely help prolong the life of the power steering components. Failure to have periodic power steering flushes results in important parts like the power steering pump, the seals, power steering rack, and the O-rings wearing out. To have a comprehensive power steering flush, call 609-641-5226 or visit Brennan's Service Center today.
Transmission flush and filter change is a comprehensive transmission maintenance service that involves the replacement of old, degraded transmission fluid and filter with new. The service is meant to prolong the life of your transmission. At Brennan's Service Center, we offer the most comprehensive transmission flush and filter service. We will exchange your old transmission oil, remove dirt, replace the filter, clean the screen, and replace used pans. Give us a call at 609-641-5226 or visit our auto shop in Egg Harbor Township, NJ 08234.
Just like replacing your engine oil, transmission service is part of your routine vehicle maintenance. The service involves removing and examining the pan, cleaning or replacing the screen or filter, cleaning the pan, reinstalling the pan (with a new pan gasket), replacing the old oil with new, and adding an additive package. Adding new fluid restores the holding power between the clutches. This service helps improve lubrication and helps maximize the life of the transmission. For all your transmission repair needs, visit or call Brennan's Service Center in Egg Harbor Township, NJ 08234 today. We offer transmission services, reseal services, and clutch services.

"Vedder Thinking | Articles Can a Bank Go to Court to Challenge its CAMELS Rating? Maybe.
On January 19, 2017, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit issued a potentially game-changing opinion concerning the appeal of a federal banking regulator's assignment of a CAMELS rating. The Seventh Circuit held that a district court in Chicago should not have dismissed a complaint brought by Builders Bank, a $100 million asset bank, challenging the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's (""FDIC"") assignment of a CAMELS rating of 4 to Builders Bank.
Builders Bank is an insured, non-member bank regulated by the FDIC. After an examination in June 2015 the FDIC assigned Builders Bank a composite rating of 4 under the Uniform Financial Institutions Rating System that measures six components: capital, asset quality, management, earnings, liquidity, and sensitivity (""CAMELS rating""). The highest rating is 1, the lowest 5. Among other supervisors uses, the CAMELS rating is a key factor in determining how much a bank must pay for deposit insurance. When the FDIC assigned a CAMELS rating of 4 to Builders Bank, the FDIC significantly raised the deposit premiums the bank pays to the FDIC.
Each appropriate Federal banking agency shall have the authority to establish such minimum level of capital for a banking institution as the appropriate Federal banking agency, in its discretion, deems to be necessary or appropriate in light of the particular circumstances of the banking institution.
The district court dismissed the suit for lack of jurisdiction, ruling that the assignment of CAMELS rating is completely and solely within agency discretion by law, and that the APA does not permit courts to review such cases. The Seventh Circuit vacated the district court’s order and remanded the case for further proceedings finding that the lower court might have jurisdiction over the matter given the right circumstances.
Whether the FDIC assignment of a 4 rating was a final agency action. Only final agency actions are appealable under the APA. Perhaps, the Court mused, the assignment of a CAMELS rating is not a final action. Perhaps, the Court continued, only an enforcement action under 12 U.S.C. §1818 constitutes a final action. At the same time, the Court noted the change in the Bank’s deposit insurance premium might be enough for the assignment of the 4 rating to be construed as a final action.
Whether Builders Bank had exhausted its remedies at the agency level. In order to pursue an action against the FDIC under the APA, Builders Bank had to have pursued all available remedies under agency rules. The Court wondered if the failure of Builders Bank to utilize the FDIC’s voluntary internal appeals process would constitute grounds to dismiss the appeal to the federal court.
The Seventh Circuit acknowledged that the power of a federal court may be restrained pursuant to 12 U.S.C. §3907(a)(2) when a court reviews how a bank regulatory agency sets minimum capital requirements. However, the Court noted there were no similar statutory restrictions to prevent a federal court from reviewing other components of the CAMELS rating, assuming the agency action constitutes final action and the complaining bank has exhausted the agency remedies. The Court reasoned that the CAMELS rating includes much more than ""capital."" Specifically, the Court explained that in addition to the ""capital"" category, the CAMELS rating assesses ""asset quality, management, earnings, liquidity, and sensitivity."" In addition, the Court questioned whether 12 U.S.C. §3907(a)(2) renders the ""capital"" component of the CAMELS rating completely unreviewable. The Court stated that ""the statute does not insulate the agency's math"" in calculating the CAMELS rating, including its ""capital"" category.
What are the likely consequences of the Seventh Circuit's holding?
Builders Bank v. FDIC opens a crack in a door that had been thought to be not only slammed shut, but bolted as well. Under the right set of circumstances, it may be possible to challenge the findings of a bank regulator in a federal court proceeding. Hurt feelings over being rated a 2 instead of a 1 may still likely not be enough. Actual harm such as the loss caused by a higher deposit premium might be sufficient.
Importantly, the Seventh Circuit's holding does not otherwise impact any federal agency actions regarding the federal regulatory enforcement process. Consequently, the Builders Bank v. FDIC opinion could serve as a catalyst and cause federal banking regulators to become more formal in their actions. Enforcement actions are subject to the administrative law process and are only subject to court appeals after the exhaustion of that administrative process. At the same time, the appeal of a composite CAMELS rating may be found as not interfering with the administrative law process. Administrative law proceedings do not affirm or override CAMELS ratings. Rather, these proceedings focus on the existence of violations of law and unsafe and unsound banking practices, and the suitable remedies for such circumstances.
This litigation is far from over. Nonetheless, the Seventh Circuit's holding might create an opportunity for a bank to challenge a federal banking regulator on the CAMELS rating assigned to that bank. As it now stands, banks have long thought it was impossible to get a court to hear a case that a CAMELS rating was grossly unfair even though the rating might be costing the bank hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars in assessment fees and deposit insurance premiums.
