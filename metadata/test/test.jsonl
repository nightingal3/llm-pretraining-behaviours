The Wildcats signed two talented PGs in Fred Brown (West Palm Beach, Florida) and Jacob Pullen (Maywood, Illinois) and added SF Andre Gilbert (Brooklyn Park, Minnesota), a JUCO transfer with Division I experience. KSU signed a pair of talented players from the Patterson School in North Carolina in SF Dominique Sutton (Durham, North Carolina) and PF Jamar Samuels (Washington, D.C.). Both will attend prep school for the Fall 2007 semester to improve their grades and will join the team at the start of the Spring 2008 semester.\nThough scheduled to graduate from high school in the Spring of 2007, SF Bill Walker (Huntington, West Virginia) finished high school early and enrolled at KSU for the 2007 Spring Semester and was allowed to join the team immediately in December of the 2006–07 season. However, he was injured in just his sixth game at KSU and opted to redshirt for the remainder of the season. He will resume his freshman season of eligibility in 2007–08. PF Ron Anderson (Upper Marlboro, Maryland), a long time AAU teammate of Beasley's, rounded out the class when he was offered a scholarship after a strong AAU showing in the Summer of 2007.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=9| Exhibition\n!colspan=9| Regular season\n!colspan=9| 2007 Old Spice Classic\n!colspan=9| Big 12\/Pac-10 Hardwood Series\n!colspan=9| 13th Annual Jimmy V Classic\n!colspan=9| K-State Holiday Classic presented by Subway\n!colspan=9| Big 12 Regular season\n!colspan=9| Phillips 66 2008 Big 12 Championship tournament\n!colspan=9|2008 NCAA tournament\nPost-season.\nBig 12 tournament.\nThe Wildcats went on to a 10–6 record in conference play, earning a number 3 seed in the 2008 Big 12 men's basketball tournament at the Sprint Center in Kansas City, Missouri.
