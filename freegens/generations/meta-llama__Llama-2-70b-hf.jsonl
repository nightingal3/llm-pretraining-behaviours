The man was buried with a carefully placed arrow in his right hand, and his bow and arrows were carefully arranged at his left hand side.\nResearchers from the Institute of Archeology and Ethnography in the Siberian branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences believe that he was part of a nomadic culture in the Altai Mountains 4,000 years ago, according to a press release from the academy.\nThis type of burial is called a kurgan, and this one was situated on a high bank of the Kulunda steppe river, which the archer’s people may have used to traverse the Eurasian steppe. The kurgan was first discovered in the 1950s, but this grave has been newly identified, the press release states.\nSkeleton of the Siberian archer found at a kurgan on the Kulunda steppe ( Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences photo )\nThe archer was buried on his back with his hands outstretched. His body was oriented with his head to the east and his feet to the west. His weapons and other grave goods were placed to the east and west of his body.\nHe was also wearing decorations, including a necklace with a cross-shaped pendant and a plaited belt. He also had a flint knife and a bone spoon or spatula in the grave. The jet bead in the form of a bull's head is an unusual find and may be the oldest such artifact in the world.\nHe was buried in a wooden coffin, which has since decayed. However, the researchers found enough pieces to estimate its size: 190 by 70 by 60 centimeters (74.8 by 27.5 by 23.6 inches). They also found a piece of birch bark that was likely the bottom of the coffin.\nThe researchers said in the press release that this is one of the oldest and best-preserved burials found in the Altai Republic.\n“The man was buried in the early 2 nd millennium B.C., and his grave remained undisturbed by any looter or rodent until it was discovered in the fall of 2014,” the press release states.\nArchaeologists are finding ancient graves all over the Altai, including one from the Iron Age and a cemetery from the Stone Age.\nTop image: This flint knife was found in the grave of a Siberian archer.

It was a high profile trip, designed to make the point that America intends to be a major player in the region over the coming decades. As one writer put it, “For Americans, the 21st century is likely to be an Asia century.”\nThat’s why it was important for the President to make this trip. I’m sure he had a lot of fun – but that was not the point. It was a trip that was full of serious business.\nFor example, the President stopped by the Asian economic summit in Bali to encourage the members of ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) to follow the lead of Europe and the U.S. in developing a free trade agreement. If America is to maintain its economic dominance in the world, it is essential that it take a leading role in the development of this emerging economic power.\nWhile there, he also pushed for ASEAN to take a firm stand against Burma’s military dictatorship.\nThen he headed to Australia for another important conference. He and Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard discussed plans to bolster American military presence in Australia. President Obama announced that he would be sending 250 Marines to an Australian base in Darwin as the first part of a gradual expansion of forces to the area.\n“It’s unfortunate that the Obama administration is expanding its military presence in Australia, and this has the potential to further complicate Sino-U.S. relations,” according to Cui Tiankai, vice foreign minister of China. “[America’s] presence could affect the regional peace and stability.”\nMr. Cui has a right to be nervous. The fact is, the Obama administration’s foreign policy is in reality a military policy. It’s a policy designed to take on China as a military power, both in the Middle East and in the Far East.\nWhile the President was in Canberra, the U.S. and Australia signed an agreement that will allow U.S. ships and aircraft greater access to Australian military bases. In addition, the two countries agreed to start a joint cyber-security initiative to counter Chinese cyber-espionage.\nFinally, the President visited the Philippines. “The Philippines is an important ally, and it’s important that the world knows that. We want to make sure that the Pacific remains peaceful and free of coercion,” said Mr. Obama.\nThe President’s trip to Asia is part of a much larger shift of focus toward the region. China has recently flexed its muscles, by establishing a territorial claim to the South China Sea. This has caused alarm among Southeast Asian nations, many of which have long-established fishing and shipping interests in the area.\nChina claims its historical records go back as far as 2,000 years to establish its claim to the area. However, it is not so much the ancient claims of China that is worrying the Southeast Asian nations as it is the modern day actions of China.\nFor example, China has been trying to seize control of the islands of the South China Sea since the mid 1980’s. In July 2012, China and Vietnam both tried to plant flags on the same uninhabited island.\nRecently, China has been using its military to assert control over the area. In October, the USS George Washington and the USS Cowpens sailed through the area. The Cowpens had to be escorted away from the area by Chinese warships. This came just after China announced it would launch a new aircraft carrier, a stealth fighter, and a new long range missile.\nAs a result, many Southeast Asian nations are looking for a way to contain China. They would be glad to have an ally – even one as far away as America.\nIn October, President Obama announced plans to send 2,500 troops to Australia on a rotating basis. He also announced plans to station Navy aircraft in the Darwin area. It is clear that the U.S. plans to move a significant portion of its Navy into the Asian Pacific, to counter China’s rising influence.\nChina has already warned the U.S. to stay away from the South China Sea. It has called America’s plans for a military presence in the Philippines, “unreasonable.”\nWhen the Philippines signed the Mutual Defense Treaty with America in 1951, it set the stage for military conflict between the U.S. and China. The treaty is very clear. It says that an armed attack on either the Philippines or the U.S. would trigger a mutual response.\nIt’s hard to predict what’s going to happen next in the South China Sea. I have no doubt that China wants to extend its control over the region. It also sees its control over the islands as a way to dominate the shipping lanes through the Straits of Malacca. However, the fact is that the U.S. is not going to stand idly by while China tries to take control of this important area.\nIt seems to me that the Philippines has become America’s newest ally in the South China Sea. It’s no wonder that the U.S. is willing to spend $32 million to build a new naval base on the island of Palawan. This base will help the U.S. keep China contained. And it will help the Philippines defend itself from a potential invasion by the Chinese.\nIn the meantime, I would keep my eyes on the region. I believe we will see increasing tensions in the coming years. In fact, we may well see the beginning of World War III in the area.\nThat’s why it was so important for President Obama to make the trip. America intends to become a major player in the region.\nAnd you can bet that China is not happy about that.\nBarack ObamaChinaJerry Robinson\nWar With Iran: Is This What You Want?"]], "filtered_resps": ["If you’ve watched the news in the past several days, you know that President Obama has just finished up a tour of Asia.

The PGA Tour’s West Coast Swing is in full swing, but it feels like the world of golf has gone dark.\nWhy? Well, the simple answer is time.\nIf you’re a fan of a sport, and the sport isn’t soccer or basketball, you’re used to watching in prime time. It’s just that simple.\nWhen it comes to the PGA Tour, most of the biggest events are played on the East Coast — think New York, North Carolina, Georgia and so on. In 2018, 42 of the 47 events were played in the Eastern Time Zone.\nThe West Coast Swing is comprised of three states — California, Hawaii and Arizona — and all three are two hours behind the East Coast. That means if you’re a PGA Tour fan, the West Coast Swing is a waking nightmare. Instead of the prime time 3-7 p.m. time slot you’re accustomed to, it’s the more than tolerable 1-5 p.m. or 2-6 p.m.\nYou’re still able to catch the end of rounds on TV, but the days of catching three and a half hours of action before dinner are long gone.\nAnd because of that, a lot of East Coast golf fans completely tune out during this stretch. Which is a shame because you’re missing out on some incredible golf. If you’re one of those people who tunes out during this stretch, we’re here to change your mind.\n1. The golf is as good as it gets\nOne of the best parts of the West Coast Swing is the golf. It’s as good as it gets, and if you’re not watching, you’re missing out on some of the best courses in the world.\nThe first week is a trip to the Plantation Course at Kapalua, and the final five events of the swing are played in the states of California, Arizona and Texas.\nGolf’s first trip of the season to the desert in La Quinta, California, provides golf fans with some of the most beautiful views on the PGA Tour. From the beautiful mountain views of the Coachella Valley to the sun shining bright, the West Coast Swing kicks off with some of the most picturesque views of the year.\nThe next week, the Tour takes a trip to Torrey Pines. The ocean views on holes 3, 6, 7 and 8 are some of the best in the world, and we haven’t even gotten to the courses of Arizona and Texas yet.\nIt doesn’t get better than the Stadium Course at TPC Scottsdale, and you can check it out at the Waste Management Phoenix Open. Then, you’re treated to some more ocean views in Monterey, California, and if you’re a fan of history, Pebble Beach is a must.\nThe West Coast Swing is an opportunity for PGA Tour fans to take in some beautiful courses, and the views are unbeatable. If you tune out during this stretch, you’re missing some of the best golf of the year.\n2. It’s the best time of year to take a trip to California\nWe all want to go to California. Well, maybe not all of us, but it’s a pretty common sentiment. Whether it’s because of the weather, the views, the culture or the vibes, we all have some sort of draw to California.\nIf you’re an East Coast PGA Tour fan, there’s no better time of year to make the trip out to California than during the West Coast Swing.\nMost of us aren’t fans of the cold weather, and a trip out to California in January or February is a nice respite from the frigid temperatures we endure on the East Coast.\nCalifornia, Arizona and Texas are among the sunniest places on earth, and we don’t need to tell you how nice it is to bask in the sun during the cold winter months.\nIf you’re an East Coaster, your next golf trip should be to California during the West Coast Swing. Not only will you have some great weather and sunny skies, but you’ll also be treated to some great golf and some of the best courses in the world.\n3. It’s an opportunity to get a jump start on your golf bets\nIf you’re a PGA Tour fan and you like to place a wager or two, you know how important it is to do your research before placing a bet. The West Coast Swing is an opportunity for golf fans to get a jump start on their research and to get a feel for who the top contenders are going to be for the rest of the season.\nIf you’re an East Coaster, you’re probably more familiar with the PGA Tour’s Florida swing. The West Coast Swing is your chance to get a feel for some of the other top courses on Tour, and to see which players perform well at these courses.\nFor instance, if you’re looking for a player to back at the Genesis Invitational, you can start your research now and see who has performed well at Riviera in the past. Or if you’re looking for a player to back at the Waste Management Phoenix Open, you can see which players have performed well at TPC Scottsdale in the past.\nThe West Coast Swing is your chance to get a jump start on your golf bets, and to get a feel for which players are going to be contenders for the rest of the season.\nSo, there you have it. The West Coast Swing is one of the best stretches of golf on the PGA Tour, and it’s a shame if you’re not tuning in. Not only will you miss out on some great golf, but you’ll also miss out on some of the best courses in the world. If you’re an East Coaster, your next golf trip should be to California during the West Coast Swing.

The following will show you why screencasting is such a useful tool in e-Learning.\nWhat is a screencast?\nScreencasting is a simple, inexpensive way to create instructional videos, also known as e-Learning videos. Screencasts can be viewed on many different devices, from cell phones to tablets to computers, so they make great tools for anyone who has a message or a lesson to share.\nA screencast is essentially a movie recording of the screen or monitor on a desktop computer, laptop or smart phone. Most people who are new to screencasting are not aware of the possibilities this tool has to offer. There are plenty of ways to use screencasts to enhance training and e-Learning, as shown in the examples below.\n1. Teachers can use screencasting to:\nCreate lesson plans\nShow how to use a new piece of classroom equipment\nProvide instruction on how to use the computer, such as how to use Microsoft Word or PowerPoint\nReinforce the message from a lesson or lecture\nRecord a lecture so that students can watch it again at a later time\nRecord and edit a video from the school play, science fair, or other event to share with parents and other students\nShow the parents how to use their child’s new computer\nShare a video of a school trip or a student project\nCreate a video library of how to perform a variety of tasks\n2.

For those who may be unfamiliar, what can you tell us about its premise?\nAdam Hall: This is a quirky love story where a dog is used to bring together two people who don’t know they are perfect for each other. The inspiration for this film came from when I was dating my wife. We would often see a couple walking their dog in the park and joke about what an awesome way that was to meet someone. We often thought about getting a dog and taking it to the park just to see who we’d meet. Of course, we never got the dog, but we did get each other. The film is ultimately about finding true love.\nBD: What inspired you to tell this story, and what can you share with us about your creative process in bringing the story to life?\nAH: As stated above, the genesis of this idea was a long time in the making. It was inspired by my real-life love story, as the film features a cute dog (just like my wife and I), a beautiful woman (just like my wife), and a somewhat neurotic man (just like me). Once the idea was created, I sat down and fleshed out the idea to a full script. After that, the story was brought to life by the brilliant actors, an incredible director, and an awesome production team. The creative process was very fluid. I would bounce ideas off the director, and together, we would come up with ways to improve and enhance the story.\nAH: My favorite part of the film is the very end when everything comes together. I love the message that the movie delivers at the end. It is a message about the power of unconditional love. I love movies that bring about emotional reactions in people. The hope is that this movie will make people laugh and then, ultimately, cry tears of joy.\nBD: You have a great cast and crew involved with the production. What can you share with us about the creative process of working with your cast and crew to bring your story to life?\nAH: The actors are what really bring this film to life. I’m incredibly lucky to have worked with such incredible actors who understood the characters and the emotions they were going through. The director, Steve Rash, did a wonderful job of working with them to bring out the best performances possible. I also have to give a big shout out to the cinematographer, Scott Peck, who did an incredible job shooting this film and giving it a unique look.\nBD: What makes Dances With Films the best venue for A Guy, A Gal and a Dog?\nAH: Dances With Films is a wonderful festival that showcases films from up-and-coming filmmakers. It is one of the most competitive film festivals in the world, with acceptance rates lower than Sundance. I’m incredibly honored to have this film premiere at this festival.\nBD: Are there any other upcoming projects on which you are currently working that you would like to share with our readers?\nAH: I’m currently developing another feature film that is also a love story, though one with a darker side to it. I can’t go into much detail now, but it’s a very personal story that I’m excited to tell.\nBD: Lastly, what would you like to tell readers who want to learn more about A Guy, A Gal and a Dog?\nAH: I would love it if readers would check out the film’s Instagram page at @aguyagalandadogmovie.
