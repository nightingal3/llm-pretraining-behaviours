thousand stations. 137 00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.680 That shows you what a big operation that was. 138 00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:18.120 But what it meant was that they had all of the railways, 139 00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:20.880 and they could do with them whatever they wanted to do. 140 00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:22.880 It meant that they could make decisions 141 00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:24.440 about what railways they wanted to keep open. 142 00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:26.480 They could close lines that weren't making any money. 143 00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:28.680 They could decide that they were only

reason that it didn't work 150 00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:44.880 was that there was too much competition. 151 00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:48.160 And that competition wasn't coming from other railway companies. 152 00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:50.160 It was coming from the road. 153 00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:51.600 It was coming from lorries. 154 00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:54.000 It was coming from buses and cars. 155 00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.400 And that was having a huge impact on the railways. 156 00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:59.400 The railways were losing money all the time, 157 00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:02.480 and eventually, something had to be done. 158 00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:04.920 And in 1948, the government stepped in again 159 00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:06.840 and nationalised the railways. 160 00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:08.320 And this time, 161 00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:11.320 they said that they weren't giving them back again, 162 00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:13.760 and they were going to run the railways 163

00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:21.680 And British Railways were formed out of, 167 00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:24.920 and built on top of the Big Four railway companies. 168 00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:27.640 But

of track. 180 00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:51.040 They had 1,000 stations in London alone. 181 00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:54.400 They were operating thousands of steam locomotives. 182 00:23:54.400 -->

We assume that we can estimate p(s) by the relative frequency of s in a corpus, that is, the observed number of occurrences of s in a corpus, divided by the length of the corpus.\n\nNow we can define the information content of s:\n\n(1)     ic(s) = -logp(s)\n\nThe information content of s is higher the lower the probability of s is (and vice versa). This is exactly what we want, since a lower probability of s means that it has a higher degree of unlikeliness.\n\nSince we use the logarithm with base 2, we can interpret the information content of a sentence in terms of “bits of surprise”. If the information content of s is 2 bits, we can interpret it as a sequence of two bits of information. We will now show that this is a meaningful interpretation.\n\nWe want to show that the information content of a sentence s is the number of bits that we need to specify which sentence in a corpus of length |s| s is. If the length of s is |s|, we can divide the set of sentences of length |s| into two disjoint subsets, each containing half of the sentences. Since the two subsets have the same number of sentences, and their union makes up all sentences of length |s|, the probability of a sentence being in one subset is equal to the probability of being in the other, which is ½. Thus, if the sentence s is in one of these subsets, we need 1 bit of information to determine which one of the two subsets s is in, that is, we need 1 bit to specify whether s is in the first or in the second subset. This is equivalent to the information content of the subset, since p(subset) = ½ (1/2 = -log(1/2) = 1 bit).\n\nThus, we can divide the sentences of length |s| into 2 subsets, each with the information content of 1 bit. If we further divide these subsets into 2 more subsets each, we obtain 4 subsets, each of which has information content 2, since p(subset) = 1/4 (2 = -log(1/4)). Continuing like this, we obtain 2|s| subsets each with probability 1/2|s|, and thus, with information content |s| (|s| = -log(1/2|s|)). There are 2|s| subsets, since there are 2|s| possible sequences of |s| bits of information. Thus, there are 2|s| possible sequences of bits of information of length |s|. These sequences correspond exactly to the possible sentences of length |s|, thus there are 2|s| possible sentences of length |s|. Thus, if we have a corpus of length |s|, the sentence s has |s| bits of information content, and it can be specified by |s| bits of information.\n\nIn the above, we have assumed that p(s) is equal to the relative frequency of s in a corpus, that is, the number of occurrences of s in a corpus, divided by the length of the corpus. However, we want the probability to be equal to the number of occurrences of s divided by the expected number of occurrences of s, that is, the probability of s should be p(s) = (number of occurrences of s)/(expected number of occurrences of s). Since the expected number of occurrences of s in a corpus of length |s| is p(s)|s|, we can rewrite the formula as:\n\n(2)    p(s) = (number of occurrences of s)/(p(s)|s|)\n\nIf we estimate p(s) using relative frequency, we will get:\n\n(3)    estimated p(s) = (number of occurrences of s)/(|s|)\n\nIf we use the estimated p(s), we have to replace (number of occurrences of s) in (2) by |s|(estimated p(s)) to get the correct probability (the result is 1/|s|):\n\n(4)    p(s) = (|s|(estimated p(s)))/(p(s)|s|) = 1/|s|\n\nThus, the information content of s can be computed as\n\n(5)    ic(s) = -log(p(s)) = log(|s|)\n\nThis is exactly the length of s in bits.\n\n### The expected information content of a sentence\n\nNow that we have computed the information content of a sentence, we can compute the expected information content of a sentence of length |s|:\n\n(6)    eic(s) = (1/|s|)Σ ic(s) for all sentences s of length |s|\n\nThis can be simplified to:\n\n(7)    eic(s) = (1/|s|) Σ log(|s|) for all sentences s of length |s|\n\nSince the logarithm and the sum can be interchanged (Σ log(x) = log(Πx)) and there are 2|s| sentences of length |s|, we obtain:\n\n(8)    eic(s) = log(2|s||s|) = |s| + log(|s|)\n\nThe first term is simply the length of s. The second term is the logarithm of the length of s. In other words, it is the length of the length of s in bits. This length is usually small, so we can ignore it in practical applications, and estimate the expected information content of a sentence by its length in bits. Since the sentence length is constant, the expected information content of a sentence is constant too.\n\nIn the above, we have assumed that all sentences of length |s| have the same probability of occurrence. This is not a realistic assumption. The probability of a sentence depends on the word order and the words in the sentence. However, it seems reasonable to assume that the word order has a larger effect on the probability of a sentence than the choice of words. Since our model does not make any assumptions about the words in the sentence, this is equivalent to assuming that all sentences of the same length and the same word order have the same probability of occurrence.\n\nFor this assumption, we can compute the expected information content of a sentence s. We simply use the relative frequency of sentences with the same word order as the probability of s, that is, the number of occurrences of sentences with the same word order as s, divided by the total number of sentences with the same length as s. The total number of sentences with the same length as s is 2|s|. The number of sentences with the same word order as s depends on the number of words that can appear in each position of s. The more words that can appear in a certain position, the less likely it is that the sentence will have the same word order as s. Thus, the number of words that can appear in each position determines the probability of the sentence. In other words, the more different words that can appear in a certain position, the lower the probability of the sentence.\n\nLet us call the number of different words that can appear in the i-th position n(i). We can now estimate the number of sentences that have the same word order as s, that is, the number of sentences that have the same number of different words in each position as s. Since there are n(i) different words that can appear in the i-th position, there are n(i) different sentences that can appear in this position. There are |s| positions, so the total number of sentences that can appear in these positions is Π n(i), that is, the product of the n(i) for all positions. This is the number of sentences that have the same word order as s. Thus, the probability of s is:\n\n(9)    p(s) = (Π n(i))/(2|s|)\n\nWe can now compute the information content of s:\n\n(10)   ic(s) = -log(p(s)) = -log((Π n(i))/(2|s|)) = |s| + Σ -log(n(i))\n\nThe first term is the length of s in bits. The second term is the sum of the logarithms of the number of different words that can appear in each position of s. In other words, it is the total number of bits needed to specify the word order of s. Thus, the information content of s is the length of s plus the information content of the word order of s.\n\nWe can now compute the expected information content of a sentence of length |s|:\n\n(11)   eic(s) = (1/|s|) Σ ic(s) for all sentences s of length |s|\n\nThis can be simplified to:\n\n(12)   eic(s) = (1/|s|) Σ (|s| + Σ -log(n(i))) for all sentences s of length |s|\n\nSince the logarithm and the sum can be interchanged (Σ log(x) = log(Πx)) and there are 2|s| sentences of length |s|, we obtain:\n\n(13)   eic(s) = log(2|s||s|) + Σ (1/|s|) Σ -log(n(i)) for all sentences s of length |s|\n\nThe first term is simply the length of s. The second term is the expected number of bits needed to specify the word order of s. This is simply the expected number of different words that can appear in each position of s. Thus, the expected information content of a sentence is the length of the sentence plus the expected information content of the word order of the sentence.\n\nThus, the expected information content of a sentence s is simply the length of s plus the information content of the word order of"]], "filtered_resps": [" is equal to the expected number of times that <s> occurs in a corpus of length <s>, that is <s>. We assume that we can estimate p(s) by the relative frequency of s in a corpus, that is, the observed number of occurrences of s in a corpus, divided by the length of the corpus.\n\nNow we can define the information content of s:\n\n(1)     ic(s) = -logp(s)\n\nThe information content of s is higher the lower the probability of s is (and vice versa). This is exactly what we want, since a lower probability of s means that it has a higher degree of unlikeliness.\n\nSince we use the logarithm with base 2, we can interpret the information content of a sentence in terms of “bits of surprise”. If the information content of s is 2 bits, we can interpret it as a sequence of two bits of information. We will now show that this is a meaningful interpretation.\n\nWe want to show that the information content of a sentence s is the number of bits that we need to specify which sentence in a corpus of length |s| s is. If the length of s is |s|, we can divide the set of sentences of length |s| into two disjoint subsets, each containing half of the sentences. Since the two subsets have the same number of sentences, and their union makes up all sentences of length |s|, the probability of a sentence being in one subset is equal to the probability of being in the other, which is ½. Thus, if the sentence s is in one of these subsets, we need 1 bit of information to determine which one of the two subsets s is in, that is, we need 1 bit to specify whether s is in the first or in the second subset. This is equivalent to the information content of the subset, since p(subset) = ½ (1/2 = -log(1/2) = 1 bit).\n\nThus, we can divide the sentences of length |s| into 2 subsets, each with the information content of 1 bit. If we further divide these subsets into 2 more subsets each, we obtain 4 subsets, each of which has information content 2, since p(subset) = 1/4 (2 = -log(1/4)). Continuing like this, we obtain 2|s| subsets each with probability 1/2|s|, and thus, with information content |s| (|s| = -log(1/2|s|)). There are 2|s| subsets, since there are 2|s| possible sequences of |s| bits of information. Thus, there are 2|s| possible sequences of bits of information of length |s|. These sequences correspond exactly to the possible sentences of length |s|, thus there are 2|s| possible sentences of length |s|. Thus, if we have a corpus of length |s|, the sentence s has |s| bits of information content, and it can be specified by |s| bits of information.\n\nIn the above, we have assumed that p(s) is equal to the relative frequency of s in a corpus, that is, the number of occurrences of s in a corpus, divided by the length of the corpus. However, we want the probability to be equal to the number of occurrences of s divided by the expected number of occurrences of s, that is, the probability of s should be p(s) = (number of occurrences of s)/(expected number of occurrences of s). Since the expected number of occurrences of s in a corpus of length |s| is p(s)|s|, we can rewrite the formula as:\n\n(2)    p(s) = (number of occurrences of s)/(p(s)|s|)\n\nIf we estimate p(s) using relative frequency, we will get:\n\n(3)    estimated p(s) = (number of occurrences of s)/(|s|)\n\nIf we use the estimated p(s), we have to replace (number of occurrences of s) in (2) by |s|(estimated p(s)) to get the correct probability (the result is 1/|s|):\n\n(4)    p(s) = (|s|(estimated p(s)))/(p(s)|s|) = 1/|s|\n\nThus, the information content of s can be computed as\n\n(5)    ic(s) = -log(p(s)) = log(|s|)\n\nThis is exactly the length of s in bits.\n\n### The expected information content of a sentence\n\nNow that we have computed the information content of a sentence, we can compute the expected information content of a sentence of length |s|:\n\n(6)    eic(s) = (1/|s|)Σ ic(s) for all sentences s of length |s|\n\nThis can be simplified to:\n\n(7)    eic(s) = (1/|s|) Σ log(|s|) for all sentences s of length |s|\n\nSince the logarithm and the sum can be interchanged (Σ log(x) = log(Πx)) and there are 2|s| sentences of length |s|, we obtain:\n\n(8)    eic(s) = log(2|s||s|) = |s| + log(|s|)\n\nThe first term is simply the length of s. The second term is the logarithm of the length of s. In other words, it is the length of the length of s in bits. This length is usually small, so we can ignore it in practical applications, and estimate the expected information content of a sentence by its length in bits. Since the sentence length is constant, the expected information content of a sentence is constant too.\n\nIn the above, we have assumed that all sentences of length |s| have the same probability of occurrence. This is not a realistic assumption. The probability of a sentence depends on the word order and the words in the sentence. However, it seems reasonable to assume that the word order has a larger effect on the probability of a sentence than the choice of words. Since our model does not make any assumptions about the words in the sentence, this is equivalent to assuming that all sentences of the same length and the same word order have the same probability of occurrence.\n\nFor this assumption, we can compute the expected information content of a sentence s. We simply use the relative frequency of sentences with the same word order as the probability of s, that is, the number of occurrences of sentences with the same word order as s, divided by the total number of sentences with the same length as s. The total number of sentences with the same length as s is 2|s|. The number of sentences with the same word order as s depends on the number of words that can appear in each position of s. The more words that can appear in a certain position, the less likely it is that the sentence will have the same word order as s. Thus, the number of words that can appear in each position determines the probability of the sentence. In other words, the more different words that can appear in a certain position, the lower the probability of the sentence.\n\nLet us call the number of different words that can appear in the i-th position n(i). We can now estimate the number of sentences that have the same word order as s, that is, the number of sentences that have the same number of different words in each position as s. Since there are n(i) different words that can appear in the i-th position, there are n(i) different sentences that can appear in this position. There are |s| positions, so the total number of sentences that can appear in these positions is Π n(i), that is, the product of the n(i) for all positions. This is the number of sentences that have the same word order as s. Thus, the probability of s is:\n\n(9)    p(s) = (Π n(i))/(2|s|)\n\nWe can now compute the information content of s:\n\n(10)   ic(s) = -log(p(s)) = -log((Π n(i))/(2|s|)) = |s| + Σ -log(n(i))\n\nThe first term is the length of s in bits. The second term is the sum of the logarithms of the number of different words that can appear in each position of s. In other words, it is the total number of bits needed to specify the word order of s. Thus, the information content of s is the length of s plus the information content of the word order of s.\n\nWe can now compute the expected information content of a sentence of length |s|:\n\n(11)   eic(s) = (1/|s|) Σ ic(s) for all sentences s of length |s|\n\nThis can be simplified to:\n\n(12)   eic(s) = (1/|s|) Σ (|s| + Σ -log(n(i))) for all sentences s of length |s|\n\nSince the logarithm and the sum can be interchanged (Σ log(x) = log(Πx)) and there are 2|s| sentences of length |s|, we obtain:\n\n(13)   eic(s) = log(2|s||s|) + Σ (1/|s|) Σ -log(n(i)) for all sentences s of length |s|\n\nThe first term is simply the length of s. The second term is the expected number of bits needed to specify the word order of s. This is simply the expected number of different words that can appear in each position of s. Thus, the expected information content of a sentence is the length of the sentence plus the expected information content of the word order of the sentence.\n\nThus, the expected information content of a sentence s is simply the length of s plus the information content of the word order of"], "doc_hash": "a3f9094801ebd93a88c39ddca5392c4840a707d0bc8fd7510fe58774960b8cde", "prompt_hash": "a7cf1fd7a4d32e07788d54e09cfae83af29b1aeed3938ded3161b41bb97ad7f8", "target_hash": "e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855", "bypass": null}

(For example, in an IBM 3380, s=12.5 ms.) Each block consists of\np pages (For example, in an IBM 3380, p=64.)\nA read of a sequential file will transfer all the pages in the file to the\nbuffer. Thus the total time to read a sequential file is\nwhere n is the number of pages in the file. Since t=0, the total time is:\nFor a random file, the situation is slightly more complicated. We can no\nlonger assume that we can read all the pages. Instead, we need to read only\na single page for each block. Thus we can get all the pages with n/p disk\nreads. Each disk read takes t+r time. In addition, we must read the first\npage of each page. Each of these takes r time. Finally, we must write each\npage. Each page write takes w time. Therefore, the total time to read a\nrandom file is:\nIn most cases, t will be much larger than r, w, or s. For example, in an\nIBM 3380, t=28 ms, r=12.5 ms, w=15 ms, and s=12.5 ms. In this case, the\nabove equation simplifies to:\nwhere k = t - r - w.\nNote that when r=w=s, k = 0 and the time for a random file is independent of\nthe block size. Also, as r and w approach t, k increases. This will reduce\nthe difference between a random file and a sequential file.\nFor example, if we assume that the IBM 3380 has k=2 ms, and that our file\nis 1280 pages long, we can calculate the total time for both the sequential\nand random file. In this case, n=1280, p=64, and k=2. We find that:\nIn this case, the time to read the sequential file is about 40% of the time\nto read the random file. This example is the basis for the rule of thumb\nthat sequential reads are about 40% faster than random reads.\n4.5.4. How do I know if my files are using sequential access?\nYou can check which files are using sequential access using the following\n$ find <data-directory> -name '*.db' -print\nCheck for sequential access\n$ for i in $(find <data-directory> -name '*.db' -print); do\n     echo -n \"$i: \"\n     echo 1 > $i\n     if grep sequential <(strings $i); then\n       echo sequential access\n       echo random access\nwhere data-directory is the directory of the database. On Linux, you can\nuse this script.\n4.6. What is the use of the log directory?\nPostgreSQL always stores the database in the data directory, usually\n/usr/local/pgsql/data. This directory contains several subdirectories:\n   pg_clog  pg_subtrans  pg_xact  pgstat\n   pg_log   pg_tblspc\nand the \"global\" relations:\n   pg_aggregate\n   pg_am\n   pg_attrdef\n   pg_authid\n   pg_cast\n   pg_class\n   pg_constraint\n   pg_database\n   pg_index\n   pg_language\n   pg_namespace\n   pg_opclass\n   pg_operator\n   pg_proc\n   pg_rewrite\n   pg_shadow\n   pg_statistic\n   pg_trigger\n   pg_type\nThese files contain the data for the tables To use the database, the data\ndirectory must be on the machine that runs the postmaster, because the files\nare accessed directly by PostgreSQL access methods.\nAll the changes made to the database are recorded in the pg_clog\nsubdirectory. This allows the database to recover in case of system crash.\nIf we move the data directory to a different machine, and set PGDATA to\npoint to the new location and the permissions are set so that the user\nrunning the postmaster can read those files, we can run the postmaster on\na different machine. This is how the log directory is used. For more\ninformation on the log directory, see the -l option in the postmaster\n4.7. What utilities are available for backing up my data?\nThere are no utilities provided for making a backup copy of your database.\nYou should use whatever backup utility you prefer, such as tar or cpio.\nBe sure to use the pg_dump utility to make a backup of your tables in case\nyour tape backup fails.\n4.8.  I am running out of disk space and want to delete old files from my\n      log directory. Which files can I delete safely?\nSee Section 20.3, \"Routine Vacuuming.\"\n4.9.  The database crashes every time I try to insert more than X MB of\n      data. What can I do?\nThe PostgreSQL backend is a 32-bit program. This means it is only\ncapable of addressing 4GB of memory. Since the backend uses memory\nfor communications buffers, temporary copies of rows being worked on,\nand so on, only a fraction of the user address space is available to\nbuffer the actual database files. This space is shared by all\nconnections to the database server.\nIf you have the kernel resource \"data segment size\" set too low, the\nPostgreSQL backend may not be able to allocate all the memory it needs,\nleading to out-of-memory failures. If this happens, the backend will print\na message to the log file telling so.\nIn some systems (e.g., BSD/OS), the system will silently kill a process\nthat tries to allocate more memory than it is allowed to. This will appear\nas \"backend [PID] was terminated due to signal 9\" in the PostgreSQL log\nfile. In such cases, you will have to increase the kernel parameter that\ncontrols the maximum data segment size.\nNote that a large data segment size is only a good thing for the backend.\nIt is possible for the backend to use much more memory than the system\nshould really permit. We recommend that the backend be run together with\na memory-limiting process such as limit, ulimit, or rlimit, depending\non your operating system. Note that setting the limit on the postmaster\nprocess has no effect, because the postmaster will always be too small\nto have problems. The limit must be set on the backend processes.\nThe postmaster is automatically imposed a limit of 1GB of memory when\nit starts. This prevents the postmaster from allocating an unreasonably\nlarge amount of memory while the database is being configured. Once\nit begins spawning backends for client connections, the limit is removed.\nIf you are using ulimit, an out of memory failure might show up as a\n\"bad file number\" message, if the system limit for open files is hit\n4.10.  Why can I not drop some column types using DROP COLUMN <column>?\nThere is no DROP COLUMN syntax in SQL92. PostgreSQL implements table\ncolumn deletion using table recreation, and this does not work with\ncolumn types that have non-trivial dependencies.\nFor example, if you have a foreign key reference from a column of table\nfoo to a column of table bar, it is impossible to delete the column from\nbar without dropping the constraint from foo. Because of this, DROP COLUMN\ndoes not allow you to drop columns that are referenced by any database\n5. Programming Interface\n5.1.  What programming languages can access PostgreSQL?\nIn addition to C, PostgreSQL has interfaces for C++, Cobol, ECPG,\nGuile, Java, ODBC, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, Tcl, and Qt.\nFor a more detailed list, see the list at\nhttp://www.postgresql.org/interfaces.html.\n5.2.  How do I import or export data from/to PostgreSQL?\nYou can export to an external file using the copy command. You can import\nfrom an external file using the copy command. For more information on copy\nsee Section 9.80, \"COPY.\"\nTo export an entire database, you can also use pg_dump.\nTo import an entire database, you can use pg_dump and psql.\nTo export a table to an external file you can use cut and psql. For example,\nthe following command exports the table my_table to a file named\nmy_table_file, removing the column names from the output file.\n$ echo '\\t' | psql database -c \"select * from my_table\" | cut -f2- > my_table_file\nFor a more detailed discussion, see Section 24.1, \"Populating a Database.\"\n5.3.  8-byte int support?\nYou can build 64 bit int support (int8) into the PostgreSQL server.\nYou need to specify the --enable-int8 configure option when building the\nserver from source code.\n5.4.  Should I use a BLOB or a file to store binary data?\nThis question is often asked by programmers who are used to Oracle or\nother database systems. Oracle provides a BLOB data type which is\nsometimes essential for binary data, but PostgreSQL provides bytea, which\nis almost as useful.\nBinary data in PostgreSQL is basically a string of bytes. With bytea data,\nit's up to the application to interpret those bytes. Bytea's are ideal for\nrepresenting binary data such as programs, GIF images, and the like.\nSince the data is in string form, you can use the standard string functions\nsuch as substring, length, position, etc. You can store binary data into a\nbytea column directly from frontend, without having to convert into\nhexadecimal notation.

Phrase-structure parsing is widely used in information extraction, question answering, and spoken dialogue systems.\nA phrase-structure tree is a binary tree in which each node is a phrase (a sequence of words) and the leaves are the words of the input sentence. Each non-leaf node has two children and represents a binary partitioning of the words in the node's phrase. Each node has a label, which is the type of the phrase being partitioned.\nThe CKY parser takes as input a phrase-structure grammar and a sentence, and returns a phrase-structure tree that is the best parse of the sentence according to the grammar. Here is the grammar used in the original presentation of the CKY parser:\n``` S-VP NP-NP PP PP-PP NP VP-PVP NP VP-PVP NP ```\nA word that is not listed is implicitly assumed to have a unary rule with its part of speech as the only symbol on the right-hand side. A rule of the form \\(\\alpha\\rightarrow\\beta\\) is shorthand for a set of rules of the form \\(\\alpha\\rightarrow\\beta\\) for each part of speech \\(r\\). For example, the rule NP-\\(\\textit{Det}\\) is a shorthand for the set of rules\n``` NP-\\(\\textit{det}\\)NP NP-\\(\\textit{det}\\)NPNP-\\(\\textit{det}\\)PRPNP-\\(\\textit{det}\\)NPNP-\\(\\textit{det}\\)AdVNPNP-\\(\\textit{det}\\)NPNP ```\nThe CKY parser is shown in figure 13. This is very similar to the general dynamic programming search of figure 11. It differs in that there is no distinction between states and actions (each is a phrase); and that there are rules for combining phrases, rather than for taking actions.\n``` functionCkyParse(\\(\\textit{words},\\textit{grammar}\\)): tree local datastructure\\(C\\)is a table with entries \\(C[\\textit{start},\\textit{end}]\\) that are sets of phrases of the form \\([\\textit{label},\\textit{span}]\\), where \\(\\textit{span}\\) is a pair of numbers (\\(s\\),\\(e\\)), \\(1\\leq s\\leq e\\leq n\\), and \\(n\\) is the length of \\(\\textit{words}\\) \\(C[\\textit{start},\\textit{end}]\\leftarrow\\)emptyset for\\(i=1\\) to\\(n\\)do\\(\\{C[\\textit{i},\\textit{i}]\\leftarrow\\)set of part-of-speech phrases for \\(\\textit{words}_{i}\\) from grammar \\(\\}\\) for\\(\\textit{len}=1\\)to\\(n-1\\)do\\(\\{\\) for\\(\\textit{start}=1\\)to\\(n-\\textit{len}\\)do\\(\\{\\) for\\(\\textit{end}=\\textit{start}+\\textit{len}\\)to\\(n\\)do\\(\\{\\) for each rule \\([\\textit{L}\\rightarrow\\textit{L1}\\textit{L2}]\\) in grammar \\(\\{\\) for each phrase \\([\\textit{L1},(\\textit{s1},\\textit{e1})]\\) in \\(C[\\textit{start},\\textit{end}]\\)do\\(\\{\\) for each phrase \\([\\textit{L2},(\\textit{s2},\\textit{e2})]\\) in \\(C[\\textit{start},\\textit{end}]\\)do\\(\\{\\) if\\(\\textit{e1}=\\textit{s2}-1\\)then \\(\\{\\) if\\([\\textit{L},(\\textit{s1},\\textit{e2})]\\) not in \\(C[\\textit{start},\\textit{end}]\\)then \\(\\{\\) add \\([\\textit{L},(\\textit{s1},\\textit{e2})]\\) to \\(C[\\textit{start},\\textit{end}]\\) \\(\\}\\) \\(\\}\\) \\(\\}\\) \\(\\}\\) \\(\\}\\) \\(\\}\\) return the best tree that starts with the start symbol \\(S\\) in \\(C[\\textit{1},\\textit{n}]\\) ```\n**Algorithm 13** The CKY algorithm for parsing with a phrase-structure grammar.\n### Statistical Parsing\nIn the context of parsing, \"statistical\" is an umbrella term for any model that assigns probabilities to syntactic constructs. There are many such models. This section will describe only one, a PCFG. Other models will be presented in chapters 16, 17, 18, and 23.\nIn a PCFG, each rule has an associated probability. Let \\(r_{k}\\) be the \\(k\\)th rule in the grammar, \\(R\\) be the set of rules, and \\(p(r)\\) be the probability of rule \\(r\\). Then:\n1. \\(\\sum_{r\\in R}p(r)=1\\)\n2. \\(\\forall r_{k}\\in R,\\quad p(r_{k})=p(r_{k}\\text{'s left hand side})\\times p(r_{k} \\text{'s right hand side}|r_{k}\\text{'s left hand side})\\)\nFor example, in a grammar with the following rules:\n\\(\\begin{array}{llll}0.\\text{S}\\rightarrow\\text{NP}\\,\\text{VP}&0.2\\\\ 1.\\text{S}\\rightarrow\\text{PP}\\,\\text{S}&0.8\\\\ 2.\\text{NP}\\rightarrow\\text{Det}\\,\\text{Noun}&0.5\\\\ 3.\\text{NP}\\rightarrow\\text{Noun}&0.3\\\\ 4.\\text{NP}\\rightarrow\\text{NP}\\,\\text{Noun}&0.2\\\\ 5.\\text{NP}\\rightarrow\\text{NP}\\,\\text{PP}&0.4\\\\ 6.\\text{VP}\\rightarrow\\text{Verb}\\,\\text{NP}&0.2\\\\ 7.\\text{VP}\\rightarrow\\text{VP}\\,\\text{PP}&0.8\\\\ 8.\\text{PP}\\rightarrow\\text{PP}\\,\\text{NP}&0.5\\\\ 9.\\text{PP}\\rightarrow\\text{PP}\\,\\text{PP}&0.5\\\\ \\end{array}\\)\nthe probability of the rule \\(\\text{NP}\\rightarrow\\text{Det}\\,\\text{Noun}\\) is \\(0.5\\) and the probability of the rule \\(\\text{VP}\\rightarrow\\text{VP}\\,\\text{PP}\\) is \\(0.8\\times 0.5=0.4\\).\nThe most important statistic in a PCFG is the probability that it assigns to a sentence, given a start symbol:\n\\[p(\\text{words}|\\text{start symbol})=\\sum_{t:\\text{grammar}(\\text{start symbol})\\vdash\\text{words}}p(t)\\]\nwhere \\(\\text{grammar}(\\text{start symbol})\\vdash\\text{words}\\) means that the grammar can parse the sentence _words_, starting from the nonterminal _start symbol_.\n### Statistical Parsing\nThe probability of a tree is just the product of the probabilities of the rules in the tree. So, for example, given the grammar \\(R\\) defined above, the probability of the tree\nis \\(0.2\\times 0.8\\times 0.5\\times 0.4\\times 0.5\\).\nNote that the probabilities in a PCFG may come from any of a variety of sources; they are not necessarily estimated from counts of rules in a treebank. For example, the probabilities might come from an estimate of the frequency of the rules in some reference corpus, or they might be the output of a classifier or a neural net.\nThe most likely parse tree for a sentence according to a PCFG can be found by an algorithm that is very similar to CKY. The only differences are that the set of candidate phrase spans \\(C[s,e]\\) has to be sorted by probability, so that the most likely spans are considered first, and that we have to keep track of the rules used in the derivation of a phrase.

For example, the rule NP-\\(\\textit{Det}\\) is a shorthand for the set of rules\n``` NP-\\(\\textit{det}\\)NP NP-\\(\\textit{det}\\)NPNP-\\(\\textit{det}\\)PRPNP-\\(\\textit{det}\\)NPNP-\\(\\textit{det}\\)AdVNPNP-\\(\\textit{det}\\)NPNP ```\nThe CKY parser is shown in figure 13. This is very similar to the general dynamic programming search of figure 11. It differs in that there is no distinction between states and actions (each is a phrase); and that there are rules for combining phrases, rather than for taking actions.\n``` functionCkyParse(\\(\\textit{words},\\textit{grammar}\\)): tree local datastructure\\(C\\)is a table with entries \\(C[\\textit{start},\\textit{end}]\\) that are sets of phrases of the form \\([\\textit{label},\\textit{span}]\\), where \\(\\textit{span}\\) is a pair of numbers (\\(s\\),\\(e\\)), \\(1\\leq s\\leq e\\leq n\\), and \\(n\\) is the length of \\(\\textit{words}\\) \\(C[\\textit{start},\\textit{end}]\\leftarrow\\)emptyset for\\(i=1\\) to\\(n\\)do\\(\\{C[\\textit{i},\\textit{i}]\\leftarrow\\)set of part-of-speech phrases for \\(\\textit{words}_{i}\\) from grammar \\(\\}\\) for\\(\\textit{len}=1\\)to\\(n-1\\)do\\(\\{\\) for\\(\\textit{start}=1\\)to\\(n-\\textit{len}\\)do\\(\\{\\) for\\(\\textit{end}=\\textit{start}+\\textit{len}\\)to\\(n\\)do\\(\\{\\) for each rule \\([\\textit{L}\\rightarrow\\textit{L1}\\textit{L2}]\\) in grammar \\(\\{\\) for each phrase \\([\\textit{L1},(\\textit{s1},\\textit{e1})]\\) in \\(C[\\textit{start},\\textit{end}]\\)do\\(\\{\\) for each phrase \\([\\textit{L2},(\\textit{s2},\\textit{e2})]\\) in \\(C[\\textit{start},\\textit{end}]\\)do\\(\\{\\) if\\(\\textit{e1}=\\textit{s2}-1\\)then \\(\\{\\) if\\([\\textit{L},(\\textit{s1},\\textit{e2})]\\) not in \\(C[\\textit{start},\\textit{end}]\\)then \\(\\{\\) add \\([\\textit{L},(\\textit{s1},\\textit{e2})]\\) to \\(C[\\textit{start},\\textit{end}]\\) \\(\\}\\) \\(\\}\\) \\(\\}\\) \\(\\}\\) \\(\\}\\) \\(\\}\\) return the best tree that starts with the start symbol \\(S\\) in \\(C[\\textit{1},\\textit{n}]\\) ```\n**Algorithm 13** The CKY algorithm for parsing with a phrase-structure grammar.\n### Statistical Parsing\nIn the context of parsing, \"statistical\" is an umbrella term for any model that assigns probabilities to syntactic constructs. There are many such models. This section will describe only one, a PCFG. Other models will be presented in chapters 16, 17, 18, and 23.\nIn a PCFG, each rule has an associated probability. Let \\(r_{k}\\) be the \\(k\\)th rule in the grammar, \\(R\\) be the set of rules, and \\(p(r)\\) be the probability of rule \\(r\\). Then:\n1. \\(\\sum_{r\\in R}p(r)=1\\)\n2. \\(\\forall r_{k}\\in R,\\quad p(r_{k})=p(r_{k}\\text{'s left hand side})\\times p(r_{k} \\text{'s right hand side}|r_{k}\\text{'s left hand side})\\)\nFor example, in a grammar with the following rules:\n\\(\\begin{array}{llll}0.\\text{S}\\rightarrow\\text{NP}\\,\\text{VP}&0.2\\\\ 1.\\text{S}\\rightarrow\\text{PP}\\,\\text{S}&0.8\\\\ 2.\\text{NP}\\rightarrow\\text{Det}\\,\\text{Noun}&0.5\\\\ 3.\\text{NP}\\rightarrow\\text{Noun}&0.3\\\\ 4.\\text{NP}\\rightarrow\\text{NP}\\,\\text{Noun}&0.2\\\\ 5.\\text{NP}\\rightarrow\\text{NP}\\,\\text{PP}&0.4\\\\ 6.\\text{VP}\\rightarrow\\text{Verb}\\,\\text{NP}&0.2\\\\ 7.\\text{VP}\\rightarrow\\text{VP}\\,\\text{PP}&0.8\\\\ 8.\\text{PP}\\rightarrow\\text{PP}\\,\\text{NP}&0.5\\\\ 9.\\text{PP}\\rightarrow\\text{PP}\\,\\text{PP}&0.5\\\\ \\end{array}\\)\nthe probability of the rule \\(\\text{NP}\\rightarrow\\text{Det}\\,\\text{Noun}\\) is \\(0.5\\) and the probability of the rule \\(\\text{VP}\\rightarrow\\text{VP}\\,\\text{PP}\\) is \\(0.8\\times 0.5=0.4\\).\nThe most important statistic in a PCFG is the probability that it assigns to a sentence, given a start symbol:\n\\[p(\\text{words}|\\text{start symbol})=\\sum_{t:\\text{grammar}(\\text{start symbol})\\vdash\\text{words}}p(t)\\]\nwhere \\(\\text{grammar}(\\text{start symbol})\\vdash\\text{words}\\) means that the grammar can parse the sentence _words_, starting from the nonterminal _start symbol_.\n### Statistical Parsing\nThe probability of a tree is just the product of the probabilities of the rules in the tree. So, for example, given the grammar \\(R\\) defined above, the probability of the tree\nis \\(0.2\\times 0.8\\times 0.5\\times 0.4\\times 0.5\\).\nNote that the probabilities in a PCFG may come from any of a variety of sources; they are not necessarily estimated from counts of rules in a treebank. For example, the probabilities might come from an estimate of the frequency of the rules in some reference corpus, or they might be the output of a classifier or a neural net.\nThe most likely parse tree for a sentence according to a PCFG can be found by an algorithm that is very similar to CKY. The only differences are that the set of candidate phrase spans \\(C[s,e]\\) has to be sorted by probability, so that the most likely spans are considered first, and that we have to keep track of the rules used in the derivation of a phrase. Here is the algorithm:\n``` functionProbabilisticCKYParse(words,grammar): tree localdatastructure\\(C\\)isatablewithentries\\(C[s,e]\\)thataresets of phraseoftheform\\([\\mathit{label},\\mathit{span}]\\),where\\(span\\)isapairofnumbers\\((s,e),1\\leq s\\leq e\\leq n\\),and\\(n\\)isthelengthofwords"], "doc_hash": "a3f9094801ebd93a88c39ddca5392c4840a707d0bc8fd7510fe58774960b8cde", "prompt_hash": "a7cf1fd7a4d32e07788d54e09cfae83af29b1aeed3938ded3161b41bb97ad7f8", "target_hash": "e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855", "bypass": null}

So we create the following instance of the service class:\nDim service As New TennisReservationService  (http://localhost/TennisReservation/ReservationService.asmx) Then we create a proxy to the service and add an endpoint reference to the proxy to tell it where to send the message. This is done by instantiating the EndpointReference class, which takes a string parameter representing the address of the service (in this case, our tennis court reservation service). We then add the EndpointReference object to the EndpointReference collection of the proxy by using the Add method:\nDim proxy As TennisReservationServiceProxy = New  TennisReservationServiceProxy  proxy.EndpointReference.Add(new EndpointReference(  http://localhost/TennisReservation/ReservationService.asmx)) The proxy is now ready to send messages to the service, and you do this by calling the proxy method, which is created for you automatically by the IDE and has the same name as the service method (SetReservation, in this case). You can see this in the following code snippet:proxy.SetReservation(date, courtName, player) At this point, the proxy has all the information it needs to formulate the message and send it off to the tennis court reservation service.\nYou can send a message without going through all of this trouble if you don't want to receive a response. For this, you use the SendOneWay method of the proxy and pass it the parameters that will be sent in the message body, like this:\nproxy.SendOneWay(date, courtName, player) This technique does not return a response, as the message is sent asynchronously.\n## Receiving Messages\nA Web service receives a message in the form of an XML document. To extract the parameters from the message body, the XML document is deserialized into objects. It is then up to the service to do whatever is required with the data and send a response back to the caller.\n### Creating a Web Service from an Interface\nTo create a Web service, first you create an interface and mark it with the\nSystem.Web.Services.WebServiceBinding attribute. This attribute has a Name property that gives the interface a descriptive name. You also need to add a\nSystem.Web.Services.WebService attribute to the interface and set its Namespace property to define the XML namespace for the Web service. An example of this is shown here:\n``` <WebServiceBinding(ConformsTo:=WsiProfiles.BasicProfile1_1), _ WebService(Namespace:=\"http://www.wrox.com/schemas\")>_ Public Interface ITennisReservationService  <WebMethod>_ Function SetReservation (ByVal date As Date, ByVal courtName As String, _ ByVal reserverName As String) As Boolean End Interface ```\nThe SetReservation method returns True if the reservation is successful, and False if it fails.\nNow you need to create a class that implements this interface and marks it with the System.Web.Services.WebService attribute. This attribute has a Class property that gives the class a descriptive name. This class is known as the _service class_:\n``` <WebService(Class:=\"TennisReservationService\")>_ Public Class TennisReservationService  Implements ITennisReservationService ```\nThe SetReservation method needs to implement the functionality required by the Web service, and for this example, it does so by returning True, indicating a successful reservation:\n``` Public Function SetReservation(ByVal date As Date, ByVal courtName As String, _ ByVal reserverName As String) As Boolean Implements ITennisReservationService.SetReservation  Return True End Function ```\n## Receiving Messages in a Web Service\nTo receive a message in the Web service, you must first add an endpoint to the service that enables it to receive messages from the client and send messages back to the client. You do this by adding a System.ServiceModel.ServiceEndpoint object to the service object's Endpoints collection. The following code shows how to do this for the tennis court reservation service:\nMe.EndpointListenUri = New Uri(\"soap.tcp://\" &  Environment.MachineName & \":8000/ReservationService\")  Me.EndpointAddress = New EndpointAddress(  Me.EndpointListenUri)  Dim binding As New NetTcpBinding  Dim endpoint As New ServiceEndpoint(binding, _  New ContractDescription(\"TennisReservationService\"))  Me.Description.Endpoints.Add(endpoint)  Me.Open() The endpoint is created with the address of the service, which is stored in the Me.EndpointListenUri variable. The service address is then stored in the Me.EndpointAddress variable by creating an instance of the System.ServiceModel.EndpointAddress class and passing it the Me.EndpointListenUri variable.\nAn endpoint requires a binding to determine how it will communicate. This binding is specified by instantiating a System.ServiceModel.NetTcpBinding object. You also need a System.ServiceModel.Description.ContractDescription object to describe the endpoint's contract, and this object is created by passing it the service contract interface name in the constructor. The endpoint is then created using the binding and contract description objects and then added to the service's Endpoints collection.\nWhen the service is opened by calling its Open method, it is ready to receive and send messages.\nThe service class implements the interface that defines the functionality for the Web service, and the interface methods are implemented in the service class. The SetReservation method of the service class is shown here:\nPublic Function SetReservation(ByVal date As Date, ByVal courtName As String, _  ByVal reserverName As String) As Boolean _  Implements ITennisReservationService.SetReservation 'Do something to save the reservation  Return True  End Function\n## The Tennis Court Reservation Web Service Application\nNow that you have seen how to create the Web service interface, you need to create a proxy that the client uses to send a message to the Web service. This is done automatically by Visual Studio 2005, which provides a proxy template. You then add code to this template to handle communication with the Web service.\nThe client application sends a message to the service via a proxy. When the service receives a message, it processes it and sends a response back to the client. This is done by creating a service object andadding an endpoint to it. The service is then opened and is ready to receive and send messages. The service functionality is implemented in a service class, which is implemented by an interface marked with a Web service binding attribute.\nTo illustrate how this works, the following Try It Out shows how to build a Web service that makes tennis court reservations, and a client that makes reservations by communicating with the Web service.\n## 1.\nOpen Visual Studio 2005 and select File \\(\\Leftrightarrow\\) New \\(\\Leftrightarrow\\) Project from the main menu.

Select ReservationService in the left pane and click Add Reference.\nSelect Project \\(\\Leftrightarrow\\) Add Reference from the main menu. In the Add Reference dialog box, click the.NET tab and add a reference to the System.ServiceModel namespace.\nAdd a Module to the project by right-clicking the project in Solution Explorer and selecting Add \\(\\Leftrightarrow\\) Module from the context menu. Enter TennisReservationServiceProxy.vb in the Name field of the Add New Item dialog box and click Add.\nOpen the TennisReservationServiceProxy.vb module file and add the following code to it:\nImports System.ServiceModel\nImports System.ServiceModel.Channels\nImports System.ServiceModel.Description\nImports TennisReservationService\nPublic Class TennisReservationServiceProxy\nImplements TennisReservationService\nPrivate binding As New WSHttpBinding\nPrivate service As TennisReservationService\nPublic Sub New()\nMe.EndpointListenUri = New Uri(\"http://localhost/\nTennisReservation/ReservationService.asmx\")\nMe.EndpointAddress = New EndpointAddress(\nMe.EndpointListenUri)\nDim endpoint As New ServiceEndpoint(\nbinding, New ContractDescription(\"TennisReservationService\"))\nMe.Description.Endpoints.Add(endpoint)\nMe.Open()\n## Chapter 23Now open the ClientApplication.vb module file, add the following code to it, and set it as the startup object:\nModule ClientApplication\nSub Main()\nDim service As New TennisReservationService  (\"http://localhost/TennisReservation/ReservationService.asmx\")  Dim proxy As New TennisReservationServiceProxy\nproxy.EndpointReference.Add(new EndpointReference  (http://localhost/TennisReservation/ReservationService.asmx))  proxy.SetReservation(5/11/2006, \"Baseline\", \"Maria Sharapova\")  proxy.SendOneWay(5/11/2006, \"Baseline\", \"Maria Sharapova\")\nEnd Sub\nEnd Module\n### 10.\nRun the application by selecting Debug << Start from the main menu.

The endpoint is then created using the binding and contract description objects and then added to the service's Endpoints collection.\nWhen the service is opened by calling its Open method, it is ready to receive and send messages.\nThe service class implements the interface that defines the functionality for the Web service, and the interface methods are implemented in the service class. The SetReservation method of the service class is shown here:\nPublic Function SetReservation(ByVal date As Date, ByVal courtName As String, _  ByVal reserverName As String) As Boolean _  Implements ITennisReservationService.SetReservation 'Do something to save the reservation  Return True  End Function\n## The Tennis Court Reservation Web Service Application\nNow that you have seen how to create the Web service interface, you need to create a proxy that the client uses to send a message to the Web service. This is done automatically by Visual Studio 2005, which provides a proxy template. You then add code to this template to handle communication with the Web service.\nThe client application sends a message to the service via a proxy. When the service receives a message, it processes it and sends a response back to the client. This is done by creating a service object andadding an endpoint to it. The service is then opened and is ready to receive and send messages. The service functionality is implemented in a service class, which is implemented by an interface marked with a Web service binding attribute.\nTo illustrate how this works, the following Try It Out shows how to build a Web service that makes tennis court reservations, and a client that makes reservations by communicating with the Web service.\n## 1.\nOpen Visual Studio 2005 and select File \\(\\Leftrightarrow\\) New \\(\\Leftrightarrow\\) Project from the main menu. In the New Project dialog box, select the Visual Basic project type in the Project Types pane on the left and the Console Application template in the Templates pane on the right. Enter a project name of **TennisCourtReservationService** and click OK.\nAdd a reference to the System.ServiceModel namespace by selecting Project \\(\\Leftrightarrow\\) Add Reference from the main menu and then clicking the.NET tab in the Add Reference dialog box. Scroll down to find the System.ServiceModel namespace, select it, and click OK.\nAdd a Web reference to the service in the client application by selecting Project \\(\\Leftrightarrow\\) Add Web Reference from the main menu. In the Add Web Reference dialog box, enter the following URL in the URL textbox and press Enter: http://localhost/TennisReservation/ReservationService.asmx\nA message is displayed saying that the XML Web services listed in the table on the left are available from the current project. Select ReservationService in the left pane and click Add Reference.\nSelect Project \\(\\Leftrightarrow\\) Add Reference from the main menu. In the Add Reference dialog box, click the.NET tab and add a reference to the System.ServiceModel namespace.\nAdd a Module to the project by right-clicking the project in Solution Explorer and selecting Add \\(\\Leftrightarrow\\) Module from the context menu. Enter TennisReservationServiceProxy.vb in the Name field of the Add New Item dialog box and click Add.\nOpen the TennisReservationServiceProxy.vb module file and add the following code to it:\nImports System.ServiceModel\nImports System.ServiceModel.Channels\nImports System.ServiceModel.Description\nImports TennisReservationService\nPublic Class TennisReservationServiceProxy\nImplements TennisReservationService\nPrivate binding As New WSHttpBinding\nPrivate service As TennisReservationService\nPublic Sub New()\nMe.EndpointListenUri = New Uri(\"http://localhost/\nTennisReservation/ReservationService.asmx\")\nMe.EndpointAddress = New EndpointAddress(\nMe.EndpointListenUri)\nDim endpoint As New ServiceEndpoint(\nbinding, New ContractDescription(\"TennisReservationService\"))\nMe.Description.Endpoints.Add(endpoint)\nMe.Open()\n## Chapter 23Now open the ClientApplication.vb module file, add the following code to it, and set it as the startup object:\nModule ClientApplication\nSub Main()\nDim service As New TennisReservationService  (\"http://localhost/TennisReservation/ReservationService.asmx\")  Dim proxy As New TennisReservationServiceProxy\nproxy.EndpointReference.Add(new EndpointReference  (http://localhost/TennisReservation/ReservationService.asmx))  proxy.SetReservation(5/11/2006, \"Baseline\", \"Maria Sharapova\")  proxy.SendOneWay(5/11/2006, \"Baseline\", \"Maria Sharapova\")\nEnd Sub\nEnd Module\n### 10.\nRun the application by selecting Debug << Start from the main menu.
