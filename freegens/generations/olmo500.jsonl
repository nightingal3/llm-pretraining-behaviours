List some interesting facts about yourself.\n4. Share a photo of a book or bookish thing.\nA: A friend nominated me and I haven’t gotten to the part yet but I’m very excited to be doing this award. This is really cool. So far I’m liking it.\nA: Oh wow, I think all of them. I feel like the books I hate are either so horrible it’s hard for me to finish them or not for me because my brain cannot seem to understand it. I think the only thing I actually threw out to the wall was a book called “It” because it was too scary for me. Everything else usually gets finished.\nA: I definitely read less adult books then YA ones and I have found myself drifting to fantasy for the last year or so.\nA: I don’t really have a reading goal but I just try to get read what I need to get done and that’s what matters.\nA: Hells no because I can’t read physical books. I think if I tried reading them I would break my eyesight. Although that makes me want to try reading physical books.\n4. What was your greatest moment as a reader?\nA: I think the most moment for my reading was when I tried reading adult books and I ended up loving it. I feel like I found the best genre for my tastes.\nA: I have always been inspired by so many books and authors so I’ve said this before but I think the most one who has inspired me the most is probably Tamora Pierce. She’s a legend and I love her writing and as a author. She’s made me want to try my hand at writing more fantasy.\n6. What was your greatest disappointment?\nA: The last one that comes to mind was a book that I gave 2 stars to and I was surprised when I was reviewing it. I wasn’t really impressed because I had already read the first few book and wasn’t as into it. So yeah, that’s been a downer but I’m glad I read it because it helped me decide maybe not to continue.\n7. What book would you recommend to anyone?\nA: Mostly YA books. It’s where I’m at right now.\n8. What is your worst habit?\nA: I’m sure this happens to most bloggers but I’m quite lazy when it comes to reviewing. So yeah, that’s a habit I can change.\n9. What’s your favorite blog post?\nA: I think it’s these questions I did. I really enjoyed answering them. I like being creative with these posts and I hope I do more questions.\n10. What is something you can’t stop watching?\nA: I watch You tube videos all the time. I watch anything on there. I even watch things on there that I never even heard about. I don’t have an addictive thing for YouTube right now but I could watch it all day if I just let it.\n11. Do you have a favourite post from your blog?\nA: I think it’s one from the top questions I asked myself and it was the one about books that made me cry. I felt it was a great topic.\n3. What is your favorite series?\n5. Who is your favorite book boyfriend?\n6. Do you write a blog?\n7. What book are you most excited to read?\n8. What do you do when you have downtime or bored?\n9.

'Nocturne' is influenced by the 70's progressive rock bands of that era, particularly the work from German outfit Ash Ra Tempel, plus also taking its cue from the psychedelia of the 60's, hence the band name being taken from 'Dagon's Reef' an adventure novel by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, as with the album's title.\nOpening track 'Ocean Sea' is a short instrumental piece clocking in at under two minutes long which really set the scene, a slow paced track with gentle ambient guitar and soft beats before a subtle electric guitar melody kicks in accompanied by more gentle beats which then fades away. There is this sense of nostalgia to the track which is quite compelling and also features the album's only vocals and it also comes across as quite atmospheric and a nice introduction to the album.\n'Sublime' is up next which consists of a brief piano introduction before a fuller progressive rock sound kicks in with some catchy guitar melodies and intricate drum work, as well as this there are some lovely deep and atmospheric vocals from Johanna Nöstling, it's a track that has a laid back vibe and plenty of prog rock influences mixed with the 70's psychedelia. There's a hint of the progressive electronic outfit Avalon here to the track, in particular with some of the guitar work, and also some of the keyboard work feels reminiscent to the likes of ELO.\n'Nocturne' the title track carries on in a similar style to 'Sublime' with it's combination of 70's prog guitar riffs and more ambient and progressive tones of atmospheric keyboards, it's a good one to sink into and the vocals from Johanna Nöstling work well here. 'Nocturne' has an easy flowing pace to it and is quite a mellow piece of prog rock with this hypnotic feel to it, yet also not a track that relies just on atmosphere to carry it along as all the other elements like the keyboards do their job of creating a full sound and there is a good balance between the vocals and instrumentation here and everything is delivered with confidence.\n'Nocturne' (the title track) is a nice way to start the album as it has this laid back and dreamy feel to it, it's a nice and mellow way to start one's prog journey, and the soundscape which it brings is quite intoxicating. 'Nocturne' is a short piece of music yet it is a strong opener to the album, as with 'Nocturne' the rest of the album follows along with a similar feel and style to the opener and is perhaps a good way to immerse oneself within the 'Nocturne' universe. 'Nocturne' consists of the instrumental 'Nocturne' which is more like a mix of atmospheric ambience with melodic guitar, delicate piano and drum fills accompanied by Johanna Nöstling's vocals, plus it also has the added elements of what sounds like samples of spoken language and vocal effects which adds another dimension to the piece.\n'Noise' comes next and it's an upbeat and catchy piece of progressive rock which has this heavy rhythm to it, the guitar is full of rich reverb which it's delivered with in a way that's quite hypnotic and the bass is deep and full of groove, while a heavy riff adds to this. There is a real sense of groove and attitude to the track with some great interplay between the keyboards and guitar and there is a wonderful feel of old school prog rock here mixed with some heavy riffing and an edginess to it, all of which makes for an enjoyable rock tune.\n'Nocturne' is back for another go and there's not a lot of difference between this and 'Nocturne' apart from it's slightly shorter in length by a matter of seconds; with 'Nocturne' however there is more instrumentation on display, including flute, synths and drums, which helps make the track a little fuller and more colourful overall. There's not a dramatic difference in style and tempo between both versions of the track, so that is the only real reason 'Nocturne' becomes redundant and thus doesn't really add much to the album.\n'Escape' is the first track on the album which has an almost dance or techno feel to it, though it's actually quite upbeat and not dark or depressing, more on a funkier side of things. 'Escape' has some good funky bass lines to it along with a rhythmic drum beat and a good electric guitar riff which also has a great sound to it. 'Escape' has a groovy feel to it, which is rather nice and this song along with 'Noise' are the heavier tunes on the album.\n'Out There' is the final track on the album, as on 'Out There' from the very outset the song just oozes with this relaxed feel to it, in particular with this laid back electric guitar which has this nice reverb effect to it. Again there's a great groove here and while this track has this nice laid back feel to it, there's not much progression or development, as 'Out There' is more of the same as the preceding tracks in that regard, still there is a sense of quality to the track itself which makes it a solid way to end this album. It's another short piece of music, coming to just three minutes in length, and in comparison with the rest of the tracks on the album it feels like a kind of 'outtake' or something added on after the main sessions ended, but all the other tracks are good enough that this isn't an issue as 'Out There' is still a good way to end the album.\nThe one thing that immediately stands out and comes to mind about the 'Nocturne' album is how this feels like the work of a band that is on the cusp of producing a full album without much in the way of changes, which also goes to say that this is more of an album in it's early stages of completion or something which has yet to be finished.\nDagon The Reef are a trio from Stockholm, Sweden, consisting of three talented musicians Erik Nösta...\nDagon's Reef have released a new track titled 'Waste Of Life' as a preview to their upcoming full-...\nFollowing from the success of his debut album 'The Unseen' back in 2014, singer-songwriter Tim Bric...\nNew from the underground of the music world is the debut album entitled 'The Unseen' from singer-s...\nThe debut album from Danish based duo The Hive Mind is a concept album of epic proportions, a so..."]], "filtered_resps": ["We are pleased to release this second album from Swedish psychedelic prog-rock outfit Dagon's Reef called 'Nocturne' this October 8th, a 10 track collection which has been three years in the making, as well as having a completely new line up, the only original member being guitarist and composer Erik Nilsson. 'Nocturne' is influenced by the 70's progressive rock bands of that era, particularly the work from German outfit Ash Ra Tempel, plus also taking its cue from the psychedelia of the 60's, hence the band name being taken from 'Dagon's Reef' an adventure novel by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, as with the album's title.\nOpening track 'Ocean Sea' is a short instrumental piece clocking in at under two minutes long which really set the scene, a slow paced track with gentle ambient guitar and soft beats before a subtle electric guitar melody kicks in accompanied by more gentle beats which then fades away. There is this sense of nostalgia to the track which is quite compelling and also features the album's only vocals and it also comes across as quite atmospheric and a nice introduction to the album.\n'Sublime' is up next which consists of a brief piano introduction before a fuller progressive rock sound kicks in with some catchy guitar melodies and intricate drum work, as well as this there are some lovely deep and atmospheric vocals from Johanna Nöstling, it's a track that has a laid back vibe and plenty of prog rock influences mixed with the 70's psychedelia. There's a hint of the progressive electronic outfit Avalon here to the track, in particular with some of the guitar work, and also some of the keyboard work feels reminiscent to the likes of ELO.\n'Nocturne' the title track carries on in a similar style to 'Sublime' with it's combination of 70's prog guitar riffs and more ambient and progressive tones of atmospheric keyboards, it's a good one to sink into and the vocals from Johanna Nöstling work well here. 'Nocturne' has an easy flowing pace to it and is quite a mellow piece of prog rock with this hypnotic feel to it, yet also not a track that relies just on atmosphere to carry it along as all the other elements like the keyboards do their job of creating a full sound and there is a good balance between the vocals and instrumentation here and everything is delivered with confidence.\n'Nocturne' (the title track) is a nice way to start the album as it has this laid back and dreamy feel to it, it's a nice and mellow way to start one's prog journey, and the soundscape which it brings is quite intoxicating. 'Nocturne' is a short piece of music yet it is a strong opener to the album, as with 'Nocturne' the rest of the album follows along with a similar feel and style to the opener and is perhaps a good way to immerse oneself within the 'Nocturne' universe. 'Nocturne' consists of the instrumental 'Nocturne' which is more like a mix of atmospheric ambience with melodic guitar, delicate piano and drum fills accompanied by Johanna Nöstling's vocals, plus it also has the added elements of what sounds like samples of spoken language and vocal effects which adds another dimension to the piece.\n'Noise' comes next and it's an upbeat and catchy piece of progressive rock which has this heavy rhythm to it, the guitar is full of rich reverb which it's delivered with in a way that's quite hypnotic and the bass is deep and full of groove, while a heavy riff adds to this. There is a real sense of groove and attitude to the track with some great interplay between the keyboards and guitar and there is a wonderful feel of old school prog rock here mixed with some heavy riffing and an edginess to it, all of which makes for an enjoyable rock tune.\n'Nocturne' is back for another go and there's not a lot of difference between this and 'Nocturne' apart from it's slightly shorter in length by a matter of seconds; with 'Nocturne' however there is more instrumentation on display, including flute, synths and drums, which helps make the track a little fuller and more colourful overall. There's not a dramatic difference in style and tempo between both versions of the track, so that is the only real reason 'Nocturne' becomes redundant and thus doesn't really add much to the album.\n'Escape' is the first track on the album which has an almost dance or techno feel to it, though it's actually quite upbeat and not dark or depressing, more on a funkier side of things. 'Escape' has some good funky bass lines to it along with a rhythmic drum beat and a good electric guitar riff which also has a great sound to it. 'Escape' has a groovy feel to it, which is rather nice and this song along with 'Noise' are the heavier tunes on the album.\n'Out There' is the final track on the album, as on 'Out There' from the very outset the song just oozes with this relaxed feel to it, in particular with this laid back electric guitar which has this nice reverb effect to it. Again there's a great groove here and while this track has this nice laid back feel to it, there's not much progression or development, as 'Out There' is more of the same as the preceding tracks in that regard, still there is a sense of quality to the track itself which makes it a solid way to end this album.

Does it exist? Is it some mystical entity that is the essence of everything, including the soul, or is it the very act of existing, the physical state that exists in our bodies?\nFor the sake of this article, let us assume that the term \"the spirit\" means all of the aforementioned things. Let's assume also that the spirit is the state that exists on an unmanifested plane (I'm not exactly sure where that plane exists, but I do know that a soul lives in its own space of consciousness, separate from the body. All of this can be read in the books, including The Secret of the Spirit and The Seven Spiritual Laws.\nNow, we can use this idea to explain many things. First, let's look at the notion of death. People who believe in reincarnation say that this state of being continues forever, while people of the belief that we have only one life have a concept of eternity. The concept of eternity is based upon a belief that there is something that exists beyond this mortal existence and is therefore an impossible state to achieve. So who is right? Well, here's an idea. If you believe in the spirit, and that the body is the materialization of the spirit, not the other way around, then it would follow that death is the final state of consciousness for the conscious entity, or \"soul\" as it's often referred to. It's no longer possible to experience a physical body, which is essentially what you have on Earth. But what happens when that physical body stops functioning? Well, it's only the physical body, but the spirit persists, as long as it is in this plane of existence. If you truly believe that the spirit is the essence of all things, and the spirit goes beyond the material plane, then it stands to reason that death is not the end, it's only a step backward. It's what makes the material body possible in the first place.\nAnd, it is in this state that we die, as it's the state of existence that is the most important, especially because it's the only way to go on in this world. It's not a question of how long a person lives, it's a question of what they did and what they became during their time here. That is the meaning of life, the meaning of the spirit.\nI realize that my theory is not entirely new, as others have theorized about the same idea, which is what makes it so easy to see it in a different light. The idea of death, while it's not entirely true, is based upon the idea that we will all eventually \"end,\" while we are still on this Earth. As our minds become evermore complex, we are able to create a \"spirit,\" because we become evermore conscious of our own existence.\nWith the creation of the soul, we are able to achieve a certain state of consciousness, as it is our brain that gives us this state, rather than our body or even our soul. This is why you feel such great pain or pleasure, because we all have that \"spirit,\" that \"soul\" as it's often referred to. This is the basis for everything, and as we gain more knowledge and experience, we gain additional information about ourselves, what we are and who we are, and thus we achieve a further understanding of who we truly are."]], "filtered_resps": ["This topic has been on my mind for quite some time, so here goes.\nSo what exactly is \"the spirit\"?

Does it mean to you that you should give Him more attention? Does it mean that you should go to church as you once did? Does it mean that you should pray and read the Bible more? Does it make you a better person?\nDo you believe that He really can help you in your life on earth, or was that just some talk? Do you really believe He can and will help you in the future, or is just something the church told you?\nIf you have done a lot of things for Him, were they really to please Him, and if not will it help to please Him for you to stop doing them?\nThe sin of blasphemy against the Holy Ghost is a very common sin, but we must understand what it really is.\nThis is about the Lord’s feelings toward it, the reason He can not forgive this sin, and about the things this will bring about.\nDo we not see how Mary is honored? She was the only one able to know the truth. Do we see how all those years she spent, in the quietness of prayer, without seeing any of what the Lord did in her day, she saw God’s love for her and his mercy and gave thanks for that love.\nDid we not see how that great prayer must have brought joy and peace to Her Soul? Did we not see how the Love of God was so strong in Mary that she did not see sin, but instead saw a love with which she could never be satisfied save in the service of her beloved?\nDid we not see all that love as the greatest gift that God could give her, yet she did not give it to Him?\nShe did not trust Him to come to her. She did not go to the Lord when He came. She could not even say “I am the servant of the Lord”.\nIt seems, like, the greatest gift of all is lost on us, when we could have the greatest gift in the world; if we only knew the gift was lost on us.\nDo we then see the purpose of the Lord’s Love in the matter? He wanted a Mother who trusted Him totally in the future. He also wanted her to live up to that love, but He did not wish her to give it away to a false religion.\nThe Love of the Lord is so great He could even forgive those who took from her the gift she was to give back to Him, if they repented of taking from her the gift He wanted to give her.\nThe same love is felt by Her Son, as he gives it back to Her in His Sacrifice upon the Cross. This gift, He would like to give it to Mary, but for the sake of the salvation of the world, He can not.\nWhy did he lose that love? Was it because he had no faith in the love he had, or because of his disobedience, which he knew was the one thing he truly loved?\nDid he not see that if he had faith in that love He would not do that? Did he not see that he was the one to take that thing away from Mary, and thus lost it all?\nHe was lost because He could no longer trust God to be true, to keep Mary safe forever, and to protect her from all harm when the time came. He had learned to hate God and to know His sin, but that did He know to be any less than God knew of sin.\nAnd why was this? Because if sin has power, so does the love of God, and the power is not in the sin itself, but in the love which is at war with sin.\nThe purpose of the Lord’s love in keeping Mary on earth in her own home, and in helping her to be faithful to the sacrifice she made, is so that He would have the honor of giving her back the gift He had once loved when she was born.\nWas He to be proud and to love her with a love He had loved in the past?\nWhy did He lose that love?\nHis obedience was disobedience; His faithlessness was faithfulness. He could not give himself with the love He loved.\nTherefore, if the Son of God has lost His love, what then shall we call this loss? We must understand it as He did.\nIf the son does not have the love of his father he is a disloyal and ungrateful servant, but when the son loses his love he becomes a traitor or rebel, who will leave you to the service of God, in exchange for the service of Satan, as the Lord did all who forsake Him and all who were lost and lost forever.\nWe have a new chance to understand what the Lord meant when He said, “I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life”. This is really a new and a bigger revelation about life and the Lord.\nThe Lord has told us His Love is not about the future, but about the past, the present, and the future.\nHis Love is for those who came to Him before they were, because when He told us our life could end in the future, it could also be a beginning."]], "filtered_resps": ["The first two of these posts are long and I wanted you to be able to read them.\nThese last two are shorter and I think you will gain a few very interesting thoughts.\nMy purpose in writing them is to help you see and experience that God’s mercy is infinite.

He also wanted her to live up to that love, but He did not wish her to give it away to a false religion.\nThe Love of the Lord is so great He could even forgive those who took from her the gift she was to give back to Him, if they repented of taking from her the gift He wanted to give her.\nThe same love is felt by Her Son, as he gives it back to Her in His Sacrifice upon the Cross. This gift, He would like to give it to Mary, but for the sake of the salvation of the world, He can not.\nWhy did he lose that love? Was it because he had no faith in the love he had, or because of his disobedience, which he knew was the one thing he truly loved?\nDid he not see that if he had faith in that love He would not do that? Did he not see that he was the one to take that thing away from Mary, and thus lost it all?\nHe was lost because He could no longer trust God to be true, to keep Mary safe forever, and to protect her from all harm when the time came. He had learned to hate God and to know His sin, but that did He know to be any less than God knew of sin.\nAnd why was this? Because if sin has power, so does the love of God, and the power is not in the sin itself, but in the love which is at war with sin.\nThe purpose of the Lord’s love in keeping Mary on earth in her own home, and in helping her to be faithful to the sacrifice she made, is so that He would have the honor of giving her back the gift He had once loved when she was born.\nWas He to be proud and to love her with a love He had loved in the past?\nWhy did He lose that love?\nHis obedience was disobedience; His faithlessness was faithfulness. He could not give himself with the love He loved.\nTherefore, if the Son of God has lost His love, what then shall we call this loss? We must understand it as He did.\nIf the son does not have the love of his father he is a disloyal and ungrateful servant, but when the son loses his love he becomes a traitor or rebel, who will leave you to the service of God, in exchange for the service of Satan, as the Lord did all who forsake Him and all who were lost and lost forever.\nWe have a new chance to understand what the Lord meant when He said, “I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life”. This is really a new and a bigger revelation about life and the Lord.\nThe Lord has told us His Love is not about the future, but about the past, the present, and the future.\nHis Love is for those who came to Him before they were, because when He told us our life could end in the future, it could also be a beginning."], "doc_hash": "45e3c16e2afcebba5bad6d617efcfd4260f74a2bcf0312b9bf9fa032f8dc294a", "prompt_hash": "3d0c1cf596181258a003e9f95c836c765d44353532e67c70d7dff48b05f64840", "target_hash": "e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855", "bypass": null}

That was one of the reasons why we decided to purchase it for our fleet - it was so new. The other reason to buy such a high-priced truck - and this is a real reason - we wanted customers to get excited.

It was expensive at first, but once you consider the price of the used vehicles you'd have to buy if you were to go that same route, the Gladiator came to us much more affordable.\nAs a customer, you get the added benefit of buying a brand new Gladiator Rubicon equipped just as you'd want one. The Rubicon comes equipped with the Jeep Active Drive Lock 4x4 system, Dana front and rear axles, electronic-locking differentials, TRX Level 1+ equipment, Rock-Trac 4x4 transfer case with a 4:1 low-range gear ratio, 2.72 axle ratio, and Bilstein® black mono-tube shocks.\nWith the four-wheel drive and upgraded off-road equipment, you'll get over the capability you'd expect. Some of the things we've had new owners do with their vehicle is taking them on a hunting trip, as well as over trails that would seem to be very difficult in a truck, and we've never had the problem so far. We've also had customers who are avid 4x4-ers and have taken them on all types of 4x4 trails to show their friends and family just how capable these trucks are.\nIf you're looking to buy a new Jeep Wrangler, a used vehicle isn't your only option. You could choose to buy a new vehicle, but if you're looking for your Wrangler or Gladiator to last a while without expensive repairs you'll want to consider a Gladiator Rubicon. The Jeep Gladiator Rubicon has a 3.6-liter Pentastar V-6 engine producing 290 hp, and it comes with four doors as well as a soft-top.\nThe Jeep Gladiator is an American legend, and it's proven to be the perfect vehicle for those who are looking for a versatile and capable pickup vehicle. You may think that a truck like this one with it's off-road technology and impressive towing capabilities will be outside of your price range but with this 2022 Gladiator Rubicon, you can have it all without breaking the bank."]], "filtered_resps": ["You won't find many places where you can purchase a brand new 2022 Jeep Gladiator Rubicon in an all-inclusive package under $60,000.

The Rubicon comes equipped with the Jeep Active Drive Lock 4x4 system, Dana front and rear axles, electronic-locking differentials, TRX Level 1+ equipment, Rock-Trac 4x4 transfer case with a 4:1 low-range gear ratio, 2.72 axle ratio, and Bilstein® black mono-tube shocks.\nWith the four-wheel drive and upgraded off-road equipment, you'll get over the capability you'd expect. Some of the things we've had new owners do with their vehicle is taking them on a hunting trip, as well as over trails that would seem to be very difficult in a truck, and we've never had the problem so far. We've also had customers who are avid 4x4-ers and have taken them on all types of 4x4 trails to show their friends and family just how capable these trucks are.\nIf you're looking to buy a new Jeep Wrangler, a used vehicle isn't your only option. You could choose to buy a new vehicle, but if you're looking for your Wrangler or Gladiator to last a while without expensive repairs you'll want to consider a Gladiator Rubicon. The Jeep Gladiator Rubicon has a 3.6-liter Pentastar V-6 engine producing 290 hp, and it comes with four doors as well as a soft-top.\nThe Jeep Gladiator is an American legend, and it's proven to be the perfect vehicle for those who are looking for a versatile and capable pickup vehicle. You may think that a truck like this one with it's off-road technology and impressive towing capabilities will be outside of your price range but with this 2022 Gladiator Rubicon, you can have it all without breaking the bank."], "doc_hash": "45e3c16e2afcebba5bad6d617efcfd4260f74a2bcf0312b9bf9fa032f8dc294a", "prompt_hash": "3d0c1cf596181258a003e9f95c836c765d44353532e67c70d7dff48b05f64840", "target_hash": "e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855", "bypass": null}

These snippets of information—or what Rexer refers to as the “found poems” that he makes his own—are then integrated into the body of Rexer’s ongoing meditation on the art of his time, a meditation that takes the form of these brief essays compiled into a collection of writings that makes apparent his “preoccupation with form and space, image and object, language, text and history.” Rexer doesn’t simply re-arrange these found artifacts or excerpts—he re-writes them, using all of the forms of contemporary art practice to shape and organize his work, from appropriation, copying or collage, to his own photography, drawings, and sculptures, including the sculpture of his found poems.\nLike many of his colleagues and readers, Rexer believes that “the best way for artists to understand their time” is “to absorb their own moment” and to use the “tools and weapons” of their chosen medium, in his case “the written word” to explore what it means to be an artist living in a particular moment and taking his place within the tradition of art history.\nLyle Rexer’s work is also unique because his art practice is so closely aligned to his academic activities, which include positions as the Director of Exhibitions and Collections at the University of South Florida in Tampa (1999-2001), Assistant Professor of Art History and Writing at NYU’s Gallery 400 in Chicago (2002–2004), Visiting Assistant Professor of Art History at the University of Miami (2004–2006), and his current position as the Director and Head of Curatorial Initiatives of UNTITLED Art Projects (NY).\nLyle Rexer has exhibited his work in major institutions and institutions worldwide, including the Smithsonian’s National Art Portfolio, The National Gallery, the High Museum, and the Center for Southern Folklore in Memphis.

The voluntary agreement focuses on meeting and maintaining a healthy human environment. It accomplishes this by eliminating emissions of ozone precursors, nitrogen oxide and volatile organic compounds (VOCs).\nThe agreement applies within boundaries with annual ozone mean daily maximum ozone concentrations greater than or equal to one part per billion by volume (ppbv). The Great Plains is one of the five regions designated by EPA for clean air enforcement under the Clean Air Act, which requires the agency to establish and implement enforceable requirements for controlling air emissions, both from stationary sources (manufacturing facilities, refineries and power plants, for example) and mobile sources (commercial aircraft and truck and train engines).\nThe states of Colorado, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas and Wyoming, together with Guam, have agreed to eliminate unnecessary or excessive emissions of ozone precursors and volatile organic compounds.

The voluntary agreement focuses on meeting and maintaining a healthy human environment. It accomplishes this by eliminating emissions of ozone precursors, nitrogen oxide and volatile organic compounds (VOCs).\nThe agreement applies within boundaries with annual ozone mean daily maximum ozone concentrations greater than or equal to one part per billion by volume (ppbv). The Great Plains is one of the five regions designated by EPA for clean air enforcement under the Clean Air Act, which requires the agency to establish and implement enforceable requirements for controlling air emissions, both from stationary sources (manufacturing facilities, refineries and power plants, for example) and mobile sources (commercial aircraft and truck and train engines).\nThe states of Colorado, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas and Wyoming, together with Guam, have agreed to eliminate unnecessary or excessive emissions of ozone precursors and volatile organic compounds. These emissions will be reduced by the states in several ways, including installing cleaner fuel systems for large trucks and industrial boilers, installing best available controls for facilities such as food processing plants and power and steel plants, and modifying industrial processes such as refineries and paper plants.

It's a new book with a completely new, simple but effective idea -- a book filled with Bible verses and a place to write how God's Word applies to your life.\n\"I know that you really love the Lord and you can see that He was faithful to you when you were struggling,\" she said. \"And that means a lot to me!\"\nI really value sharing God's truths because they are good, and He is good!

It's not the first 5-minute Bible I've read, but I've not come across any other daily devotional that focuses so completely on God's word! All 365 verses are written in a way that is both easy to read and fun to remember, and in a manner that's easy to share with others.\nBut the best part? Each verse is paired with a thoughtful commentary by popular ladies pastors like Priscilla Shires, Heather Varian and Amy Davis, as well as some of my favorite Christian women bloggers.\nIt's not a Bible that's designed to be kept secret!

It's a way to do God's work by talking about the book, because doing God's work is the purpose of devotional reading!\nI really like that \"doing God's work\" can be as simple as sharing a Bible verse with a coworker in the break room!\nBecause the purpose of each day's devotional is to bring out the truth that applies most specifically to you, you can share any way that's best for the person you're talking to.\nOr use the writing guide to share with your family over shared meals!\nMy husband is the biggest fan of this devotional because writing it is such a natural fit for our time together.

As you see how the Lord is showing himself in your life the more obvious things become to share with others.\nI really believe that it's this simple devotional that I've just enjoyed that helps me show how God's truths really do change us and shape our lives.\nThe very nature of the 5 minute guide makes it a simple, natural way to do more than read a devotional book. It's a way to do God's work by talking about the book, because doing God's work is the purpose of devotional reading!\nI really like that \"doing God's work\" can be as simple as sharing a Bible verse with a coworker in the break room!\nBecause the purpose of each day's devotional is to bring out the truth that applies most specifically to you, you can share any way that's best for the person you're talking to.\nOr use the writing guide to share with your family over shared meals!\nMy husband is the biggest fan of this devotional because writing it is such a natural fit for our time together. He keeps his eyes to the Lord as we eat and write a bit each day!\nFor example, we recently shared a sweet message from the book that talked of our wonderful God's grace.\nWhat verse have you been thinking or praying about recently that would bless your friends? If they weren't familiar with the Lord and reading the Bible, what verse would you want them to know?\nWhat is one truth you are grateful to God for right now?\nIs there a specific Bible promise that would bless and encourage your kids or siblings?\nWhat is something that you think of each day? Which is it, writing what's on your mind or writing what's on God's heart?\nNow you have a simple, natural way to start building new, deeper discipleship, family, and friendship relationships!\nThis devotional is just the first in a series of great books that have helped me share more actively about the Lord and the Bible in our household.\nAnd you can pick up these two other great books by following this link!\nHave you tried an e-devotional book on reading your Bible?\nCan you share how you'd use this one in your life?\nHow about a book that helps you share your faith with others?\nI hope you enjoyed the book and other resources highlighted on this blog post.\nAnd when you want another fun, easy way to share God's love with your friends and coworkers, I hope you'll come back and check out all these great posts!\nIf you found this post helpful, the easiest way to get every new post delivered directly to your inbox is to sign up for The Inspiration Gallery newsletter."], "doc_hash": "45e3c16e2afcebba5bad6d617efcfd4260f74a2bcf0312b9bf9fa032f8dc294a", "prompt_hash": "3d0c1cf596181258a003e9f95c836c765d44353532e67c70d7dff48b05f64840", "target_hash": "e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855", "bypass": null}

I also dined at The Smith where I sampled the lamb terrine, truffled poached egg and lamb pancetta and it was divine.\nIn case you’re curious about the recipes, I found some great ones on Epicurious.

It’s fun and not too hard, but it’s not the most common item to have in one’s larder.\nAlso, I think this should be posted as part of one of your “recipes” archives….\nI love this kind of recipes, as usually, I only use foie gras in soups and stews. Your recipe would be great, but I have never used truffled pearl for my terrines.\nWhat a great idea to pair charcuterie with truffled pearls! The terrine looks great.\nWow, I love the idea of foie gras and lamb terrine. The lamb terrine sounds divine! Now I want some!\nI like the idea of truffled pearls. I think I need to make some of my own.\nI was on the Smith’s website, and I think what you ordered, the egg in the glass was a deviled egg with a chicken liver mousse. They all look devine.\nI love foie gras and am thrilled they’ve found an interesting and affordable way to sell the dish!\nWow, the foie gras parfait looks soo yummy!\nBeautiful! I didn’t know they have that at The Smith. I think what makes it work so well is the foie gras – who knew foie gras and lamb terrine would work as well as it does?!\nI have been meaning to make terrine for my next party, and your is the best inspiration that i have seen so far!\nAnd the foie gras parfait sounds amazing!!!\nOh my, that looks so delicious. I have yet to try my hand at terrines myself but they look like too much fun to pass up. How many of those little cubes are there in the bottom of the dish?\nI love these little piggy terrines. They sound wonderful and are so cute! I also have made terrines twice in the past couple of years and I like the process and the end result, but I don’t think I like them that much.

I just learned how to make foie gras mousse and I am looking forward to experimenting with different flavours!\nI love the idea of truffled pearls in a terrine!!! I’ve only had foie gras once, and it had no bacon.\nI’ve yet to try my hand at charcuterie. Your terrine looks deliciously simple and easy to make. I’d never heard of truffled pearls either, they sound like a great addition to a terrine or stuffing!\nI just saw the terrine on a food show that recently aired on the Food Channel! But it still looks delicious! I’m glad that you like the lamb terrine at Breslin as well. Next time when I go back there, I’m sure to ask for it!

A couple favorite spots that I wanted to share were The Smith and The Breslin. What stands out most about these New York eateries was the use of house-made charcuterie. When I visited the Breslin, I ordered the chicken liver and foie gras parfait with truffled pearls and I was blown away. I also dined at The Smith where I sampled the lamb terrine, truffled poached egg and lamb pancetta and it was divine.\nIn case you’re curious about the recipes, I found some great ones on Epicurious. The links will give you the recipes for the chicken liver, foie gras and lamb terrine. For my favorite version of a lamb terrine, visit this entry on A Foodie’s Lament.\nThanks for the recipes.

How will they change the patient’s experience? How will they transform the provider’s experience? Which technology is best-suited for healthcare organizations? How can the industry keep up with these changes?\nWe recently sat down with James Vlasblom, the leader of IBM’s Healthcare & Life Sciences strategy and thought leadership, to discuss these questions and some of the top trends that will reshape the healthcare industry in 2018.\nQ: What are big challenges for companies operating in the healthcare industry?\nA: The healthcare industry continues to undergo transformations, specifically due to the technological improvements.\nI see the healthcare industry is a highly competitive industry to be in at the moment. We’re seeing major players moving into the industry. And even in the past half a year, you’ve seen major players moving into the industry. We’re seeing the major payers like CVS, Walmart, and Amazon move into healthcare with their own solutions to take on the existing players.\nWe’re also seeing technology players such as Google, Apple, and Microsoft move their technologies to healthcare. We are witnessing the digital transformation. Digital transformation is a big trend. What we’re seeing with these companies is their focus on cloud transformation and big data analytics. This can be used to analyze large volumes of data to drive the digital transformation agenda.\nIt’s imperative for healthcare providers and organizations to understand the new emerging technologies and to start applying them for better services.\nQ: How can a service provider’s digital maturity impact the industry?\nA: Service providers need to evaluate the current capability set. They need to check where they are currently positioned. Digital maturity is a crucial element of transformation. It’s about your capabilities around delivering services from a customer perspective. Providers can deliver the services by leveraging the digital technologies. They can also enhance their current capabilities in the digital space to achieve better outcomes for the people and organizations.\nQ: What are the new trends that will transform the healthcare industry in 2018?\nA: There are three main trends for healthcare this year. The first one is about personalization, where you can personalize your experience. We are now at a point where you can customize healthcare. You can personalize it by location, by the provider, by your location, and how you are using the solutions. Providers and providers can give better services to their customers based on their location and how they want to take care of their healthcare needs.\nThe second trend is around predictive analytics and insights. This is about driving and improving the predictive and prescriptive model. Organizations can use the data that’s being collected from providers for patient data, for patients and providers, into healthcare. It will allow them to analyze the data to drive the insights and use to improve their patient-centric model.\nThe next one is around cognitive computing. Cognitive computing is about using artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and robotics to analyze data and drive insights.\nQ: Which technology is best-suited for healthcare organizations?\nA: I believe, in the healthcare world, there’s a need to integrate technologies across clinical systems, back-office systems, and business processes. One of the technologies that will help transform healthcare is artificial intelligence (AI). AI is based on human intelligence and can interact with other humans in different ways. AI can be applied in almost all the major areas in the healthcare industry. It’s particularly important for the service industry, for example, by understanding your business requirements and optimizing the outcomes.\nIn healthcare, there’s a lot of data analysis to be done to understand the needs of patients and providers. We can use these tools to understand the needs and to make predictions based on the information provided.\nAnother technology, for example, is the IBM Watson Health, which applies the science of AI to drive the decisions. The decision has to be made in real time to provide the information to healthcare providers. We can use AI to analyze the data to identify patterns. You can identify the patterns based on the information provided and make predictions.\nIBM provides the technology for a lot of healthcare solutions. We provide tools, analytics, and capabilities needed for healthcare providers to make better decisions. The next step is how we can extend these technologies to improve the patient experience.\nQ: How can the industry keep up with these changes?\nA: Healthcare providers and organizations need to take advantage of the new emerging technologies. Providers need to invest in the emerging technologies. They need to focus on their own digital transformations by improving the digital capabilities in the current transformation to take on the big players.\nThe industry should keep up by investing in different technologies to stay relevant and to provide innovative solutions to the healthcare industry. By investing in technology solutions, healthcare industry can improve the quality of services provided to patients and drive better outcomes.\nThe healthcare industry in the US is the largest employer of all occupations in the country. In fact, it employs almost 20% of the total employees in the country.\nWith healthcare industry being one of the fastest growing industries, it is important that a healthcare organization knows very well what factors are driving its success and failure.\nAnd, if it is taking advantage of new innovative technology solutions, it is a bonus."]], "filtered_resps": ["What are the new trends that will transform the global healthcare industry in the near future?

Many of us know Bill as a dedicated member of the WMC and MCM community, working for an important part of the community. It is very important to understand the role of this person. Read on.\nThe purpose of this document is to share my observations, experiences and knowledge of our industry so that all participants may take advantage of the opportunities presented by our growing industry.\nMy name is Bill Zeban. I have been in the automotive industry for over 20 years. I have owned two dealerships, been a manufacturer district sales manager with Ford Motor Company and have spent the last 7 years as the CEO and President of the World Motorsport Council, a professional membership and certification division of SEMA. This organization was established to give an alternative for car dealers and other individuals involved in the automotive aftermarket to show their professionalism in business and technical competency. In the past, the aftermarket focused on the manufacturer’s certification, which was a good idea but it did not allow for the participation of independent shops. We are a non stock or member based association. Certification is not only good reputation marketing but also provides a base to expand our industry.\nThere are some misconceptions that seem to arise regularly about SEMA, the aftermarket and other related organizations and industries. I will share my insight and expertise on how the aftermarket functions in hopes of clarifying some of these issues.\nOver the last several years, SEMA has grown at a much faster pace than the rest of the aftermarket. The automotive aftermarket is a $20 billion industry. SEMA is a relatively small part of that but it provides many benefits to our segment. In 2007, over 75 percent of SEMA revenue came from auto parts and service. The remainder of revenue is derived from product development and licensing. Approximately 75 percent of manufacturers that are represented at SEMA use this organization for research to improve their products and services to dealers. We also provide dealer education services, and we work on legislation that benefits our members and the aftermarket as a whole.\nMany people are afraid that SEMA will only benefit large auto service operations, but the aftermarket in general represents smaller businesses than you may think. The average size of a SEMA dealer is two cars. This means that almost a million shops are represented in our member and certified member base. So the majority of people that you see at SEMA are not the big giants that you may anticipate and they are a huge portion of our society. Some are so small that they are not even listed in the Dealer Locator.\nAnother misconception is that most people that are involved in the SEMA show are members. In fact, most members do not visit or display at this show. Many members, especially the larger manufacturers, have found different means of reaching customers and dealers during the year with promotions and dealer meetings. However there is a significant portion that attend the show to see what is new, talk with competitors and suppliers and take advantage of the networking opportunities. Dealers and other independent shops that are members of SEMA find that this show is very effective for their businesses. By attending the show, they are able to reach more dealers and customers than they would have reached by taking a traditional trip to Las Vegas.\nMany of the manufacturers that sell to the aftermarket are at SEMA on a regular basis. This group is the majority of the members in SEMA and it includes several large manufacturers of automotive parts, tools, accessories and equipment. The manufacturers have the majority of their employees at SEMA because it is a highly productive time for them, providing opportunities to view our members’ cars, make purchases and learn about marketing services for their business. The manufacturers also use the show to meet with their independent sales managers, dealers and their own distributor network all under one roof. It is hard to explain the value of this event to an outsider.\nWe are not just an industry organization; we are an industry event. As I said before, the aftermarket is a $20 billion industry. Many of the major companies in this business find it difficult to attend a single show that reaches that amount in revenue. There are several multi day events that our industry attends in Las Vegas. Our members that are also manufacturers also set up trade exhibits that cover a much smaller area. In fact, most of their exhibits are just outside the entrance of the SEMA show and are just as effective as having them in the SEMA show floor. If a manufacturer cannot use one of their representatives to attend SEMA, they have the option to send a car and a banner that has their name on it. These display methods save them money and allow for the participation of many more people than they could hire for an entire show.\nSEMA also hosts many side events to entertain people who are not manufacturers and to keep them busy during these events. One of the most popular events is the annual SEMA Show Auto Corral, which features car shows on Friday evening and all day Saturday. On Friday night the Show Auto Corral features special shows open just to members of the automotive industry. Most of the members at this show are also members of SEMA. The show features special car shows for manufacturers, manufacturers specials for independent car care show and SEMA Show Cars. This is also a very popular event that does not have a cost to attend and the entry fees are low.\nOther events include the SEMA Cares Charity Classic held at the SEMA Show in Las Vegas in conjunction with a car auction. Since its inception in 2004, the Cares Charity Classic has raised an astounding over $8 million for charities.\nThe SEMA Show is very intense for us. We do our best to protect the interests of our members at our events by putting in place strict codes of conduct to regulate behavior at our events. We are very serious in this matter. SEMA has provided special training to our members and employees so that these issues are taken seriously.\nSEMA, like many other organizations, is comprised of many different personalities from a wide range of backgrounds and professions. As in any group, you will have some folks that will not represent your best interests. The best example of this is a small but vocal group of people that attempt to use the association to gain favor. SEMA does not and will always have a reputation of protecting the interests of its members. This is our primary responsibility to the aftermarket.\nWe must realize that if some people would stop playing games and were more concerned with the value of the organization we would find we had the support of a lot more people.\nThere are other organizations that represent the aftermarket with the same professional standards that SEMA does. The major automotive association (AMA) does not serve the after market as a whole and has more of an auto parts focus, not just automotive performance parts.\nSince 2003, I have worked with the AMA in an effort to become more involved. The AMA and I have had three meetings in the last year that I know of and they seem very concerned with their members. At our first meeting, our association was being reviewed by the AMA to see if we would be qualified to become a member. At the second meeting, there was still not a clear answer and the AMA made some changes to their code requirements for membership. To say that a code of ethics does not work or is not necessary is not the case with SEMA. We have to constantly be on guard to keep the right kind of people from joining our organization.\nSince my meeting with the AMA board, I have continued to see a lack of understanding of the difference between SEMA and the AMA and that SEMA provides a better quality membership and a level of service that the AMA cannot provide. There have been several recent instances where AMA members have approached us about membership issues. It is very discouraging for SEMA to see how some people are misrepresenting our association to members. It also makes you aware of those that don’t understand what a level of commitment it takes for our association to be successful.\nIt is easy for someone to tell you what is good about an organization in one sentence. After that, things go downhill. For that reason, I decided to go into detail about what we do and why we do it, so you may see how much work goes into our association.\nWe do not have the time or the resources to respond to questions for every company that has a problem or just needs to talk. We can only take care of the requests that are submitted to us through our website. We have received several calls and written letters from companies outside our organization. I have never seen a website or association that has as much information as ours, but there is no reason to have access to our member or dealer service data or to ask us questions. The most important reason is that we are a professional membership association and we take very seriously the responsibilities of preserving our reputation.\nI feel that you are not only the first point of contact for a company that has any issue with SEMA. You act as the main communicator with the company for that company and can answer a lot of the questions that are asked of us. As the first point of contact, you seem to see our organization through a different lens. All it takes is a few positive or negative responses to start making a name for your service or your company. I know this because I have seen it happen on several occasions and that also happens all the time on the Internet and when I go on the SEMA website!\nOur website is always being upgraded and we have added a members’ area where everyone can update or add to their existing content. We have added a page that is updated by the AMA to show the code of ethics which has been passed on by the association.

I think you'd need at least 3 ranks of knowledge: nature (and maybe intelligence) as well as perception to actually make use of it, but even without it I think it'd still be quite nice.\n\nAnyway, it's definitely an interesting feat, and I'd never seen anyone do anything like it before.

However, there are numerous soft skills that can be learned as well. To better your chances of securing the position of your choice, you should acquire these skills.\nThese skills are important for a job seeker’s success. These skills not only help you stand out from the crowd. Even if you are seeking a job where your work experience is all that is required, soft skills can prove to be just as important as technical skills.\nIf you’re not sure how to improve your soft skills, you may need to get some outside help. Our team at Cielo has the expertise and experience to assist you in improving your soft skills and, as a result, your chances of landing that perfect job.\nHard Skills – Hard skills refer to any skills relevant to the job you are applying for, ranging from programming languages to accounting principles. Since it is easier to teach individuals hard skills, they are more useful than soft skills.\nSoft Skills – These are attributes that are more difficult to teach. They refer to how you conduct yourself in your daily interpersonal interactions in a variety of settings. These skills are difficult to quantify and evaluate, but having them will set you apart as an employee. Soft skills are extremely beneficial to job applicants since they help to improve the candidate’s ability to interact positively with employees and management, and are valued by corporate leaders in a wide range of industries, both in the United States and abroad.\nInterpersonal Skills: These skills can be acquired through training and are useful in any workplace. They are essential for teamwork, as they help to establish trust in one’s ability to interact with coworkers and clients. The most difficult skills to learn are communication skills, such as active listening skills, or how to interact with other team members in an interpersonal or group setting. In fact, active listening skill is very difficult. You must be able to hear other people and truly understand what they have to say in order to truly listen effectively.\nA critical component of interpersonal skills is the ability to communicate clearly. It is difficult to have a conversation with other people without communicating effectively. The ability to effectively resolve conflicts is essential for any job position or organization. It can be difficult to stay calm and avoid getting agitated in the most difficult situations, but it is necessary. Having good communication skills can help you resolve conflicts in a manner that is both productive and efficient.\nOther interpersonal skills that can be developed include the ability to motivate others, to effectively delegate tasks, and to work well as part of a team or leader. Motivation is a characteristic that sets you apart. It will determine the outcome of any project that you are assigned. Because motivation is so easy to acquire, it is often ignored by students and employees. It is important to understand that motivation can be learned, but it should be nurtured in order to achieve the highest possible results.\nDelegation skills are another critical skill. Delegation is the act of assigning tasks to someone else in order to free up your time for more important activities. One of the most common mistakes that are made in the workplace is that one employee will assign too many tasks or assignments but won’t follow through on what has been assigned. If one person becomes too involved in the assignment, it can make the whole team sluggish and unproductive. Other employees may not even understand what has been assigned to them, so there is no point in trying to implement new ideas. It is easy for one person or group to take over another’s workload, and it can cause resentment and a decreased level of trust between workers.\nTeamwork skills can come into play when a project requires more than one person. Because each individual has their own strengths and weaknesses, it is important to assign tasks based on what the team needs to accomplish. This is why it is important to train yourself and your employees how to work together as a team. When a team is organized and operates smoothly, productivity is increased and there are fewer employee turnovers. This means a better workplace for everyone.\nThe importance of customer service skills cannot be overestimated. A good customer service team is instrumental in the success of any business. In fact, it is necessary for the success of any organization in any service or business. Having good customer service skills can help you to effectively deal with customers, keep the customer happy and make sure that the product or service provided meets customer expectations.\nA customer service employee must be able to identify problems, make suggestions, and resolve issues quickly. This is done by asking the customer about his or her needs and expectations, then making suggestions and using resources to make sure that the product or service is delivered on time. Customer service representatives can do a large amount of research on their own, so they are highly valued. In addition, customer service representatives often receive recognition and promotions.\nAs you can see, soft skills are just as important as technical skills when it comes to finding and keeping a job. You will not only stand out from the crowd by showing off your communication skills, but you will impress other employees and leaders.\nIf you’re unsure about how to improve your soft skills and strengthen them, you’re in luck!

The proposal, announced by Europe’s Finance Ministers, has sparked a wave of reactions from industry stakeholders and policymakers alike, who’ve questioned the proposed move, its implications and the overall effect the regulatory scheme could have on crypto and Web3 ecosystems.\nThe proposed rules could have dramatic consequences for the crypto industry in Europe, making compliance to regulations a necessity to operate within the continent, requiring crypto services companies to adopt Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) protocols such as those introduced by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) recommendations, to comply with local laws.\nCrypto businesses must be able to maintain KYC and AML records and, due to their nature, they are often seen as inherently risky for money laundering, which can lead to the disruption of the entire business, and therefore, the overall development of the European crypto space.\nAlthough European authorities aren’t particularly welcoming to crypto, crypto-friendly nations like Malta and Switzerland are taking the lead in this industry, introducing laws to support the crypto community and boost digital assets’ adoption, while the UK appears to be lagging behind.\nAmidst growing regulatory pressure, European crypto businesses may look towards offshore jurisdictions that are less stringent when it comes to cryptocurrency regulation. For startups specifically, being able to operate freely or with very loose restrictions is what they value most, which is why jurisdictions such as Malta, Costa Rica, Singapore, Malta, Panama, and Switzerland attract a huge number of crypto projects every year.\nWhat exactly is the FATF, and, most importantly, who is impacted by this new regulatory framework?\nFATF, short for Financial Action Task Force, is a global regulatory body that sets standards to combat money laundering and other financial crimes.\nIn the crypto industry, the FATF has two main guidelines, one set of standards aimed at traditional financial institutions, and another, the Travel Rule standard, which regulates how crypto companies must comply with its guidelines or face heavy fine penalties.\nIn an effort to combat money laundering, FATF requires traditional financial institutions and crypto companies to maintain KYC, identify their users, and report suspicious transactions which could be related to money laundering or other fraudulent activities.\nHowever, FATF also requires traditional financial institutions to adhere to “travel” rules, which specify that “services providers must identify and share information about the payer of money and the beneficiary of money or virtual currency” when a transactional service like a wire transfer or a credit card payment occurs.\nThe implication of the FATF travel rule standard was that crypto was, for the first time, recognized as a means of payments, and as a result, as a target for AML/CTF purposes. As such, crypto-to-crypto transactions, and transfers from digital wallets, were now a target for AML/CTF verification, despite the fact that crypto is often used by people in countries with high numbers of unregulated or illegal financial activities, which have high risk levels for money laundering.\nRegulators in different jurisdictions may interpret the FATF standards in different ways, putting their national policies in conflict with international regulations, which is exactly what happened at the time with the EU, who tried to implement the FATF standards while they were still in progress and lacking any concrete definition.\nIn 2020, despite the continued lack of clarity regarding how to apply the FATF standards on crypto transactions, the EU took a step forward and adopted a proposal for a “market standard” that set a minimum level for AML/CTF regulation, in anticipation of more clarity from FATF.\nThe draft law, although aimed at all banks and financial institutions, can be interpreted by regulators as an attempt to apply regulations on crypto operators in the EU. The draft law would prohibit all digital asset service firms from accessing the European financial sector and operate within the EU without a license or a “PassPorting” mechanism. PassPorting is a regulatory mechanism that allows European authorized institutions the ability to provide services in another EU country. It is commonly used by financial institutions in the crypto space as a way to bypass regulations in other jurisdictions.\nHowever, the fact that crypto businesses are not currently required to follow AML/CTF policies already in place in many jurisdictions puts crypto at a disadvantage when compared to traditional financial institutions operating in the same jurisdiction. Therefore regulators may view the crypto sector too risky for AML/CTF compliance if they are operating independently.\nThe EU proposal has been met with significant backlash by the crypto industry.\nAmong the main criticisms of the proposal is that the EU’s current draft law lacks clarity.\nThe vagueness of the proposal makes it difficult for crypto businesses to gauge what policies they must follow, and whether they can benefit from the same regulatory systems used by traditional financial institutions.\nThe lack of clarity also makes it difficult for EU authorities to understand what cryptocurrency businesses can offer, and, therefore, how their financial assets can be properly regulated, which is also why crypto companies are now looking elsewhere for opportunities in less onerous jurisdictions.\nIf the current proposal is approved by the European Parliament, which has yet to be approved, crypto companies operating in the EU face heavy obstacles and potential disruption of their businesses.\nFor crypto businesses operating in the EU, complying with AML/CTF policies and the European market standards is mandatory if they want to stay operational in the EU, or access EU financial markets for both fiat and crypto services.\nThere are numerous crypto service providers operating in Germany, but there are other countries with more lenient crypto regulations, such as Austria, Malta, Switzerland, and even Singapore whose stringent compliance policies will attract more crypto companies in the future.\nIt’s clear that the crypto industry needs to be regulated, but how the regulations are applied, and the actual implications could mean the difference between a thriving business and the complete cessation of operations."]], "filtered_resps": ["In December, the European Commission announced its plans to propose new legislation that would regulate crypto-assets under the same terms as conventional financial services and products.

That is, showing instead of telling or using a different device to describe it (e.g. showing through dialogue, or using a character to repeat the words, even though the character is already aware of it.) I'll ask myself if it isn't better to tell a thing once or twice so I can get it done, instead of using a device, or even better, putting it as dialogue - for which the character would say it.

They don't tend to use many devices to show events, but instead use the simple, matter-of-fact way they tell things. For instance, one I really like, Steven Erikson, will just go ahead and describe something, without putting any filter in front of it. In contrast, say, I might be hesitant to say something like: \"Djall took his axe out of the hole he had burned in the floor, and threw it into the flames.\" I realize the person knows what just happened, but I wonder - can I express the information I want to convey, in another way that isn't so telling?\n\nAgain, here I want to address the caveats I mentioned earlier.

It also has the advantage of quick refueling times: according to the WLTP certification criteria, the Taycan takes around half an hour for a recharge to 80 percent. The E-Tron, with a 90 kWh battery, reaches the same level after an hour.\nPorsche expects to launch more than 100 electrified models by 2025, while by 2030 its annual sales of electrified and battery-powered vehicles should reach one billion. But the company also wants to remain flexible – the 911, for example, can still be purchased with a gasoline engine.\nThe sports car manufacturer does not want to be a player in the electric car market in the coming years. That is why Porsche wants to be more flexible by combining electric propulsion with combustion engine technology. The future model for everyday use thus becomes a hybrid.\nWhile the Porsche Cayenne has been the model for electric drive for a long time, the 911 and Macan have to wait a little longer.

There is also the intention of expanding the range by plug-in hybrids, which are also to be deployed under the label 992.\nThe first information about the Cayman models for the next generation have already been announced: The front is said to be more upright than today and therefore also sportier, while the rear could benefit from a less aggressive character line.\nAt the same time, the next-generation 718 Boxster is already in the starting blocks. This model will also receive an electrically assisted mid-engine hybrid system, with a drive concept based on the Taycan and the Panamera Sports Turismo.

The mid-range sports car, for example, comes on the market from 2020 under the names 718 and 728.\nIn both models, the new 48-volt starter-generator should increase the maximum torque by 20 percent and increase the fuel efficiency by 15 percent. The electric sports car e-Boxter concept, presented at the 2013 Geneva Motor Show on a concept of the Cayman S, is also still at the stage of planning.

They didn't really care about truth in the least; they were driven by a passion to persecute and even kill Him.\nThen we move to those who didn't have an immediate problem with Him. They appreciated Him for what He was – and so they made the effort to come and actually listen to Him. At first, that was all they did – listen – before they dismissed Him. But they were willing to make the effort, and so they went on to do more.\nThat's where we are at this point in Mark. \"But He moved on through more cities and villages... until He reached his destination.\" If you recall, Jesus went to Jerusalem to start His public ministry where He went about carrying out the mission God had given His Son. When He got to Jordan, He was baptized by John who prepared Him to minister. Now He has gone throughout Galilee – He hasn't even spent a lot of time in Jerusalem – and they're continuing to listen... but they're continuing to be confused by just what they're hearing.\nI am convinced that Jesus didn't have any problem talking with those who were simply curious. His problem was with those who did not want to hear; who had a different agenda; who were driven by an agenda to see Christ crucified again – as they viewed it.\nI do not know how many will see this sermon series as relevant today since we are in the midst of the coronavirus and social distancing. I have no idea how this disease will turn out or how much worse it might become. But one thing I do know and that is if the current problem continues we need to find different ways to connect.\nI believe and have always believed that churches need to find ways to connect with people in a virtual way. For us that means having online services on Sunday morning and having them available on video later in the day so people can view them if they want. But there should be other ways to maintain that connection and I think we'll find out as the days continue.\nIn the meantime, for me it is not as important what we're going through now as it is where do churches go from here – what can they still have on Sunday morning that people can view online to get connected.\nAs I look at it today, the important part for us as churches is how will we meet people's needs online rather than in person? It could be about something as simple as putting video on the website or making a video available in social media for people to watch later, or, if a church is equipped to do livestreaming, we can put them up there on a regular basis and hopefully people will feel more connected as a result.\nNow in the midst of all of that, we are continuing our series based on Mark's gospel. So far Mark's gospel is a series of events; and in this series it has been in a somewhat reverse chronological order. Now he goes back to what he considered the key point of Jesus's ministry and that would be the beginning.\nLast week, Mark finished the account of Jesus being questioned by some Jews in Jerusalem because He had healed some on the Sabbath. Although we know that Jesus did a fair amount of His healing ministry on the Sabbath so as to get this message out, this incident is unique. Mark has never given any account of what happened, and he goes into a fair amount of detail of Jesus' response. In the process he makes some very important points.\nIn that incident Jesus does something that the religious leaders found extremely offensive. He was healing on the Sabbath. He healed the man with the ear. He healed him through healing the man with the sick. He was taking this most basic physical need of all and, not only taking care of it but restoring it, or even perhaps restoring him to his normal self. That's what He showed the man he needed – that his ear was healed enough to be attached once again. That's what He was doing.\nAnd so Mark tells that He healed him and he had so much compassion on him that He healed him so that he could be a witness to what God wants people to be – restored and re-connected. And he was also a witness at the same time to why this needed to be changed and that was to provide testimony to what God has done. And so Mark is telling us that Jesus did this to provide testimony about what Jesus did so they would remember in the days to come what He did about His ministry on the Sabbath.\nNow that's kind of where we are going to pick up today. In the account of that healing last week, Mark told us some of what He said – but now we're going to go deeper into what He said to them.\nI believe that in this scene what He said to them was one of the most significant things that He ever said and was one of the most significant things that He ever taught anyone. Although it has been written down by His disciples and the disciples that gathered around Him, the world at large, with the exception of a very few followers, has forgotten His teachings and He was saying such profound things that people would find difficult to understand it in a short period of time. They would have to learn and spend time together for people to get the understanding, but He still continued to teach them.\nSo in this scene we get a little insight into the mindset of the Jews at this time, which is a mindset that has never been completely removed. Jesus's response to what He said in Mark 3:4, you remember, was for them to be offended. And if He could only get them to understand it and not be offended, then they would be saved and they would understand and they would see the truth and the way things ought to be.\n\"The disciples said to Him, 'Teacher, we know that you are true and care for no one. You have no respect for the high official because you care for no one. \nIn other words, the Jewish leadership has a perception of who Jesus is. Jesus isn't just a Galilean; He's from Nazareth – Nazareth of Galilee. They say He's the product of the low end of Israel. They are very sure that Jesus is a person who is the ultimate hypocrite. The fact is the Jews knew that if they did anything on the Sabbath they could be prosecuted. That was the law. So, Jesus is a hypocrite because He is being a hypocrite; He's breaking the law, and He's doing it on the Sabbath.\nThen there is the fact that His disciples are plucking heads of grain. The fact is He is breaking the law by not letting them gather grains to satisfy their physical need. Now that is not the full story of the law of the Sabbath. For instance, the command to work on the Sabbath is for one's physical needs, and God has given us what's necessary for our needs and He has permitted it. And that's just one aspect of why they were breaking the law.\nBut that is a law that they are very sure that Christ is in violation of. The fact that Christ allowed His disciple to pluck grain and eat it shows, again, that He is in violation of the law.\nBut that's not all about the Sabbath – that's just a portion of what He said about what the Sabbath is for. He is making a much more profound point. First of all, Jesus says, \"In what way is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or bad?\" Jesus is asking because it seemed to be that the way He was doing these works was not done with their authority so that He would make a clear point about what He's teaching.\nThis is just a short bit of an explanation about how the Sabbath is for us to do good for others and not for Christ to be violating the law – for us to be obeying it. And as it turned out, He had just performed an amazing action with His disciples. First of all, if people broke the Sabbath law and were seen by others, they would be stoned without question. In the midst of breaking the Sabbath law, He allowed His disciples to pluck grain. He has just done an amazing thing. In fact, they say He is making a mockery of the Sabbath because He permits them to pluck the heads of grain, which is breaking the law.\nNow the question is: What law did they break? The answer is the law on the Sabbath concerning work. They were permitted to gather grain. But they were supposed to make sure they gathered enough grain for their physical needs for the Sabbath and they were not, from the context, plucking the heads of grain and collecting them for their physical needs – unless they were plucking that grain to be eaten.\nThe Pharisees had a good legal case that Jesus was breaking the law because, in the culture, it was very difficult at certain times to get through the day and do anything physical at all if you didn't have some food for a meal. So they said that they were only plucking the head of grain. They said that they were not going to pluck the grain until the end of the Sabbath. However, He said He would not be the judge on whether that interpretation was right, or whether it was wrong. And He said, \"Is it lawful to do good on the Sabbath?\"\nIn verse 18 when He quotes from Isaiah, He is quoting from the \"Prophets\" not from the Old Testament but from Isaiah. When he mentions the Prophets, in the original text it said \"the prophets.\" The text uses \"the prophets\" as a collective noun.\nIn the original text it uses a plural noun, \"the Law.\" The text"]], "filtered_resps": ["At first it seemed to me that we would not get any further than those who first heard Him – some of whom gave Him no more than a casual passing attention before they turned sharply away in disgust. They didn't really care about truth in the least; they were driven by a passion to persecute and even kill Him.\nThen we move to those who didn't have an immediate problem with Him. They appreciated Him for what He was – and so they made the effort to come and actually listen to Him. At first, that was all they did – listen – before they dismissed Him. But they were willing to make the effort, and so they went on to do more.\nThat's where we are at this point in Mark. \"But He moved on through more cities and villages... until He reached his destination.\" If you recall, Jesus went to Jerusalem to start His public ministry where He went about carrying out the mission God had given His Son. When He got to Jordan, He was baptized by John who prepared Him to minister. Now He has gone throughout Galilee – He hasn't even spent a lot of time in Jerusalem – and they're continuing to listen... but they're continuing to be confused by just what they're hearing.\nI am convinced that Jesus didn't have any problem talking with those who were simply curious. His problem was with those who did not want to hear; who had a different agenda; who were driven by an agenda to see Christ crucified again – as they viewed it.\nI do not know how many will see this sermon series as relevant today since we are in the midst of the coronavirus and social distancing. I have no idea how this disease will turn out or how much worse it might become. But one thing I do know and that is if the current problem continues we need to find different ways to connect.\nI believe and have always believed that churches need to find ways to connect with people in a virtual way. For us that means having online services on Sunday morning and having them available on video later in the day so people can view them if they want. But there should be other ways to maintain that connection and I think we'll find out as the days continue.\nIn the meantime, for me it is not as important what we're going through now as it is where do churches go from here – what can they still have on Sunday morning that people can view online to get connected.\nAs I look at it today, the important part for us as churches is how will we meet people's needs online rather than in person? It could be about something as simple as putting video on the website or making a video available in social media for people to watch later, or, if a church is equipped to do livestreaming, we can put them up there on a regular basis and hopefully people will feel more connected as a result.\nNow in the midst of all of that, we are continuing our series based on Mark's gospel. So far Mark's gospel is a series of events; and in this series it has been in a somewhat reverse chronological order. Now he goes back to what he considered the key point of Jesus's ministry and that would be the beginning.\nLast week, Mark finished the account of Jesus being questioned by some Jews in Jerusalem because He had healed some on the Sabbath. Although we know that Jesus did a fair amount of His healing ministry on the Sabbath so as to get this message out, this incident is unique. Mark has never given any account of what happened, and he goes into a fair amount of detail of Jesus' response. In the process he makes some very important points.\nIn that incident Jesus does something that the religious leaders found extremely offensive. He was healing on the Sabbath. He healed the man with the ear. He healed him through healing the man with the sick. He was taking this most basic physical need of all and, not only taking care of it but restoring it, or even perhaps restoring him to his normal self. That's what He showed the man he needed – that his ear was healed enough to be attached once again. That's what He was doing.\nAnd so Mark tells that He healed him and he had so much compassion on him that He healed him so that he could be a witness to what God wants people to be – restored and re-connected. And he was also a witness at the same time to why this needed to be changed and that was to provide testimony to what God has done. And so Mark is telling us that Jesus did this to provide testimony about what Jesus did so they would remember in the days to come what He did about His ministry on the Sabbath.\nNow that's kind of where we are going to pick up today. In the account of that healing last week, Mark told us some of what He said – but now we're going to go deeper into what He said to them.\nI believe that in this scene what He said to them was one of the most significant things that He ever said and was one of the most significant things that He ever taught anyone. Although it has been written down by His disciples and the disciples that gathered around Him, the world at large, with the exception of a very few followers, has forgotten His teachings and He was saying such profound things that people would find difficult to understand it in a short period of time. They would have to learn and spend time together for people to get the understanding, but He still continued to teach them.\nSo in this scene we get a little insight into the mindset of the Jews at this time, which is a mindset that has never been completely removed. Jesus's response to what He said in Mark 3:4, you remember, was for them to be offended. And if He could only get them to understand it and not be offended, then they would be saved and they would understand and they would see the truth and the way things ought to be.\n\"The disciples said to Him, 'Teacher, we know that you are true and care for no one. You have no respect for the high official because you care for no one. \nIn other words, the Jewish leadership has a perception of who Jesus is. Jesus isn't just a Galilean; He's from Nazareth – Nazareth of Galilee. They say He's the product of the low end of Israel. They are very sure that Jesus is a person who is the ultimate hypocrite. The fact is the Jews knew that if they did anything on the Sabbath they could be prosecuted. That was the law. So, Jesus is a hypocrite because He is being a hypocrite; He's breaking the law, and He's doing it on the Sabbath.\nThen there is the fact that His disciples are plucking heads of grain. The fact is He is breaking the law by not letting them gather grains to satisfy their physical need. Now that is not the full story of the law of the Sabbath. For instance, the command to work on the Sabbath is for one's physical needs, and God has given us what's necessary for our needs and He has permitted it. And that's just one aspect of why they were breaking the law.\nBut that is a law that they are very sure that Christ is in violation of. The fact that Christ allowed His disciple to pluck grain and eat it shows, again, that He is in violation of the law.\nBut that's not all about the Sabbath – that's just a portion of what He said about what the Sabbath is for. He is making a much more profound point. First of all, Jesus says, \"In what way is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or bad?\" Jesus is asking because it seemed to be that the way He was doing these works was not done with their authority so that He would make a clear point about what He's teaching.\nThis is just a short bit of an explanation about how the Sabbath is for us to do good for others and not for Christ to be violating the law – for us to be obeying it. And as it turned out, He had just performed an amazing action with His disciples. First of all, if people broke the Sabbath law and were seen by others, they would be stoned without question. In the midst of breaking the Sabbath law, He allowed His disciples to pluck grain. He has just done an amazing thing. In fact, they say He is making a mockery of the Sabbath because He permits them to pluck the heads of grain, which is breaking the law.\nNow the question is: What law did they break? The answer is the law on the Sabbath concerning work. They were permitted to gather grain. But they were supposed to make sure they gathered enough grain for their physical needs for the Sabbath and they were not, from the context, plucking the heads of grain and collecting them for their physical needs – unless they were plucking that grain to be eaten.\nThe Pharisees had a good legal case that Jesus was breaking the law because, in the culture, it was very difficult at certain times to get through the day and do anything physical at all if you didn't have some food for a meal. So they said that they were only plucking the head of grain. They said that they were not going to pluck the grain until the end of the Sabbath. However, He said He would not be the judge on whether that interpretation was right, or whether it was wrong. And He said, \"Is it lawful to do good on the Sabbath?\"\nIn verse 18 when He quotes from Isaiah, He is quoting from the \"Prophets\" not from the Old Testament but from Isaiah.

This is really cool. So far I’m liking it.\nA: Oh wow, I think all of them. I feel like the books I hate are either so horrible it’s hard for me to finish them or not for me because my brain cannot seem to understand it. I think the only thing I actually threw out to the wall was a book called “It” because it was too scary for me.

I think if I tried reading them I would break my eyesight. Although that makes me want to try reading physical books.\n4. What was your greatest moment as a reader?\nA: I think the most moment for my reading was when I tried reading adult books and I ended up loving it. I feel like I found the best genre for my tastes.\nA: I have always been inspired by so many books and authors so I’ve said this before but I think the most one who has inspired me the most is probably Tamora Pierce. She’s a legend and I love her writing and as a author. She’s made me want to try my hand at writing more fantasy.\n6. What was your greatest disappointment?\nA: The last one that comes to mind was a book that I gave 2 stars to and I was surprised when I was reviewing it. I wasn’t really impressed because I had already read the first few book and wasn’t as into it. So yeah, that’s been a downer but I’m glad I read it because it helped me decide maybe not to continue.\n7. What book would you recommend to anyone?\nA: Mostly YA books. It’s where I’m at right now.\n8. What is your worst habit?\nA: I’m sure this happens to most bloggers but I’m quite lazy when it comes to reviewing. So yeah, that’s a habit I can change.\n9. What’s your favorite blog post?\nA: I think it’s these questions I did. I really enjoyed answering them. I like being creative with these posts and I hope I do more questions.\n10. What is something you can’t stop watching?\nA: I watch You tube videos all the time. I watch anything on there. I even watch things on there that I never even heard about. I don’t have an addictive thing for YouTube right now but I could watch it all day if I just let it.\n11.

'Nocturne' is influenced by the 70's progressive rock bands of that era, particularly the work from German outfit Ash Ra Tempel, plus also taking its cue from the psychedelia of the 60's, hence the band name being taken from 'Dagon's Reef' an adventure novel by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, as with the album's title.\nOpening track 'Ocean Sea' is a short instrumental piece clocking in at under two minutes long which really set the scene, a slow paced track with gentle ambient guitar and soft beats before a subtle electric guitar melody kicks in accompanied by more gentle beats which then fades away. There is this sense of nostalgia to the track which is quite compelling and also features the album's only vocals and it also comes across as quite atmospheric and a nice introduction to the album.\n'Sublime' is up next which consists of a brief piano introduction before a fuller progressive rock sound kicks in with some catchy guitar melodies and intricate drum work, as well as this there are some lovely deep and atmospheric vocals from Johanna Nöstling, it's a track that has a laid back vibe and plenty of prog rock influences mixed with the 70's psychedelia. There's a hint of the progressive electronic outfit Avalon here to the track, in particular with some of the guitar work, and also some of the keyboard work feels reminiscent to the likes of ELO.\n'Nocturne' the title track carries on in a similar style to 'Sublime' with it's combination of 70's prog guitar riffs and more ambient and progressive tones of atmospheric keyboards, it's a good one to sink into and the vocals from Johanna Nöstling work well here. 'Nocturne' has an easy flowing pace to it and is quite a mellow piece of prog rock with this hypnotic feel to it, yet also not a track that relies just on atmosphere to carry it along as all the other elements like the keyboards do their job of creating a full sound and there is a good balance between the vocals and instrumentation here and everything is delivered with confidence.\n'Nocturne' (the title track) is a nice way to start the album as it has this laid back and dreamy feel to it, it's a nice and mellow way to start one's prog journey, and the soundscape which it brings is quite intoxicating. 'Nocturne' is a short piece of music yet it is a strong opener to the album, as with 'Nocturne' the rest of the album follows along with a similar feel and style to the opener and is perhaps a good way to immerse oneself within the 'Nocturne' universe. 'Nocturne' consists of the instrumental 'Nocturne' which is more like a mix of atmospheric ambience with melodic guitar, delicate piano and drum fills accompanied by Johanna Nöstling's vocals, plus it also has the added elements of what sounds like samples of spoken language and vocal effects which adds another dimension to the piece.\n'Noise' comes next and it's an upbeat and catchy piece of progressive rock which has this heavy rhythm to it, the guitar is full of rich reverb which it's delivered with in a way that's quite hypnotic and the bass is deep and full of groove, while a heavy riff adds to this. There is a real sense of groove and attitude to the track with some great interplay between the keyboards and guitar and there is a wonderful feel of old school prog rock here mixed with some heavy riffing and an edginess to it, all of which makes for an enjoyable rock tune.\n'Nocturne' is back for another go and there's not a lot of difference between this and 'Nocturne' apart from it's slightly shorter in length by a matter of seconds; with 'Nocturne' however there is more instrumentation on display, including flute, synths and drums, which helps make the track a little fuller and more colourful overall. There's not a dramatic difference in style and tempo between both versions of the track, so that is the only real reason 'Nocturne' becomes redundant and thus doesn't really add much to the album.\n'Escape' is the first track on the album which has an almost dance or techno feel to it, though it's actually quite upbeat and not dark or depressing, more on a funkier side of things. 'Escape' has some good funky bass lines to it along with a rhythmic drum beat and a good electric guitar riff which also has a great sound to it. 'Escape' has a groovy feel to it, which is rather nice and this song along with 'Noise' are the heavier tunes on the album.\n'Out There' is the final track on the album, as on 'Out There' from the very outset the song just oozes with this relaxed feel to it, in particular with this laid back electric guitar which has this nice reverb effect to it. Again there's a great groove here and while this track has this nice laid back feel to it, there's not much progression or development, as 'Out There' is more of the same as the preceding tracks in that regard, still there is a sense of quality to the track itself which makes it a solid way to end this album. It's another short piece of music, coming to just three minutes in length, and in comparison with the rest of the tracks on the album it feels like a kind of 'outtake' or something added on after the main sessions ended, but all the other tracks are good enough that this isn't an issue as 'Out There' is still a good way to end the album.\nThe one thing that immediately stands out and comes to mind about the 'Nocturne' album is how this feels like the work of a band that is on the cusp of producing a full album without much in the way of changes, which also goes to say that this is more of an album in it's early stages of completion or something which has yet to be finished.\nDagon The Reef are a trio from Stockholm, Sweden, consisting of three talented musicians Erik Nösta...\nDagon's Reef have released a new track titled 'Waste Of Life' as a preview to their upcoming full-...\nFollowing from the success of his debut album 'The Unseen' back in 2014, singer-songwriter Tim Bric...\nNew from the underground of the music world is the debut album entitled 'The Unseen' from singer-s...\nThe debut album from Danish based duo The Hive Mind is a concept album of epic proportions, a so..."]], "filtered_resps": ["We are pleased to release this second album from Swedish psychedelic prog-rock outfit Dagon's Reef called 'Nocturne' this October 8th, a 10 track collection which has been three years in the making, as well as having a completely new line up, the only original member being guitarist and composer Erik Nilsson.

There are numerous factors that you must take into consideration when choosing a school, including the reputation and accreditation of the schools, the educational quality of the programs, and the preceptor experience of the teaching faculty. You may also want to talk to some students to get their opinions of the schools as well.\nThe first thing you need to do is to complete your research. This means that you need to spend time researching the different schools and the degree programs they offer. Make sure to find out what the focus of their programs is as well as what the overall reputation of the schools and programs are as well. You might even want to take a visit to one or two of the schools in person to see if you enjoy the campus culture and the way that the students are trained.\nYou may also want to speak to some of the instructors that they have on their staff. Educators who are in office long term can generally offer better insight and information about the courses and what each college focuses on. This helps you select a school that has the potential of being a good fit for your educational and career goals.\nYou should also make sure that the schools are accredited. Accreditation is one of the first steps of making sure you will receive the qualifications and degree that is best for you. There are many online options that you can consider when choosing to locate and complete an accredited program. Consider contacting the departments of education of any colleges you want to find out more about the educational requirements of your state.\nAfter you have narrowed down your schools based on their accreditation, reputation and other important factors, it is time to find a school that offers the type of practical training that will help you succeed in your field. There are several aspects of online and classroom training including core curriculum, computer requirements and the technical details that are associated with working in your chosen profession. You should look at which programs will help you meet all of these requirements before applying to schools.\nThere are many different career paths in the field of education. Depending on the type of program the student selects, there could be job related benefits in the field following graduation. When it comes to teachers and other positions in the classroom setting, you could gain more work experience to add to your resume. Some schools offer on-the-job training programs to help with certification or licensing. This type of training may also help with professional development for administrators and leaders.\nIt is common for school districts to offer bonuses, pay increases and other benefit packages to teachers. These benefits may offer financial assistance during professional development, student tuition assistance and scholarships, medical insurance, dental insurance and other health benefits if employees qualify. Teaching employment may also offer tuition reimbursement, a retirement plan and more.\nA number of schools are now starting to offer degrees online. This is a convenient way to learn as well as obtain a degree. This can allow you to work and school at the same time without having to move or go to evening classes. You can study on your own time as well as completing your assignments when you have free time and get your degree without having to disrupt your busy life schedule!\nStudents who work on their bachelor degrees generally earn more money than people who do not have a degree in education. In fact, when comparing wages across all jobs, teachers tend to earn more than the average amount of money.

There are numerous factors that you must take into consideration when choosing a school, including the reputation and accreditation of the schools, the educational quality of the programs, and the preceptor experience of the teaching faculty. You may also want to talk to some students to get their opinions of the schools as well.\nThe first thing you need to do is to complete your research. This means that you need to spend time researching the different schools and the degree programs they offer. Make sure to find out what the focus of their programs is as well as what the overall reputation of the schools and programs are as well. You might even want to take a visit to one or two of the schools in person to see if you enjoy the campus culture and the way that the students are trained.\nYou may also want to speak to some of the instructors that they have on their staff. Educators who are in office long term can generally offer better insight and information about the courses and what each college focuses on. This helps you select a school that has the potential of being a good fit for your educational and career goals.\nYou should also make sure that the schools are accredited. Accreditation is one of the first steps of making sure you will receive the qualifications and degree that is best for you.

Some schools offer on-the-job training programs to help with certification or licensing. This type of training may also help with professional development for administrators and leaders.\nIt is common for school districts to offer bonuses, pay increases and other benefit packages to teachers. These benefits may offer financial assistance during professional development, student tuition assistance and scholarships, medical insurance, dental insurance and other health benefits if employees qualify. Teaching employment may also offer tuition reimbursement, a retirement plan and more.\nA number of schools are now starting to offer degrees online. This is a convenient way to learn as well as obtain a degree. This can allow you to work and school at the same time without having to move or go to evening classes.

Does it exist? Is it some mystical entity that is the essence of everything, including the soul, or is it the very act of existing, the physical state that exists in our bodies?\nFor the sake of this article, let us assume that the term \"the spirit\" means all of the aforementioned things. Let's assume also that the spirit is the state that exists on an unmanifested plane (I'm not exactly sure where that plane exists, but I do know that a soul lives in its own space of consciousness, separate from the body. All of this can be read in the books, including The Secret of the Spirit and The Seven Spiritual Laws.\nNow, we can use this idea to explain many things. First, let's look at the notion of death. People who believe in reincarnation say that this state of being continues forever, while people of the belief that we have only one life have a concept of eternity. The concept of eternity is based upon a belief that there is something that exists beyond this mortal existence and is therefore an impossible state to achieve. So who is right? Well, here's an idea. If you believe in the spirit, and that the body is the materialization of the spirit, not the other way around, then it would follow that death is the final state of consciousness for the conscious entity, or \"soul\" as it's often referred to. It's no longer possible to experience a physical body, which is essentially what you have on Earth. But what happens when that physical body stops functioning? Well, it's only the physical body, but the spirit persists, as long as it is in this plane of existence. If you truly believe that the spirit is the essence of all things, and the spirit goes beyond the material plane, then it stands to reason that death is not the end, it's only a step backward. It's what makes the material body possible in the first place.\nAnd, it is in this state that we die, as it's the state of existence that is the most important, especially because it's the only way to go on in this world. It's not a question of how long a person lives, it's a question of what they did and what they became during their time here. That is the meaning of life, the meaning of the spirit.\nI realize that my theory is not entirely new, as others have theorized about the same idea, which is what makes it so easy to see it in a different light. The idea of death, while it's not entirely true, is based upon the idea that we will all eventually \"end,\" while we are still on this Earth. As our minds become evermore complex, we are able to create a \"spirit,\" because we become evermore conscious of our own existence.\nWith the creation of the soul, we are able to achieve a certain state of consciousness, as it is our brain that gives us this state, rather than our body or even our soul. This is why you feel such great pain or pleasure, because we all have that \"spirit,\" that \"soul\" as it's often referred to. This is the basis for everything, and as we gain more knowledge and experience, we gain additional information about ourselves, what we are and who we are, and thus we achieve a further understanding of who we truly are."]], "filtered_resps": ["This topic has been on my mind for quite some time, so here goes.\nSo what exactly is \"the spirit\"?

This novel follows two families and is interwoven with the story of a small town community where there are many secrets and lies. I thought this novel could almost be read as a romance, and yet it is also a historical novel. I would recommend this book to those who like a story that is well told that pulls on the narrative at different angles; I would recommend this book to readers who like a story with secrets and lies, and a story set during a time where there was change happening. I think that this novel is well written and it pulls on the reader's emotions. I feel that I am being told a story about a place and about human relationships. This novel also contains a number of historical facts that I was keen to find out about, such as; Native American history before the White Man arrived. The Gilded Hour is a novel to read and reread to uncover all of the history behind the story. There are a number of characters in this novel, and as well as the two families that we join for the most part in this novel, there are many more. These characters are quite diverse, and so each character can bring different emotions to the story. There are some interesting relationships in this novel, and these relationships are interesting to read about and to try to unravel. This novel also focuses on a family that has been affected by the loss of a child. I was not sure at the beginning of this novel exactly what was going to make this novel special for me, but it turned out that I was captured by the story of the town and by how the two families in this novel interacted.

When we understand it to be that way, our fear of being found guilty will be gone, our hope and love for him to be returned and our fear of death to be removed.\nWe will realize that He created us as “new creatures”, and that if we have repented, accepted Christ, obeyed the commandment to seek the Lord until He is found and repented in an act of true contrition (which many people think is to be as sincere as possible or to try harder), He has promised us “new hearts”, a clean slate, a full pardon, and complete freedom from all fears and regrets.\nWe will have a perfect relationship with God in heaven with the opportunity to ask Him for anything we have forgotten or thought we could never ask Him to do.\nOne little story about Mary will show you what the Lord thinks of her.\nHe also does not accept those to Heaven who are guilty of the sin against the Holy Ghost, although this sin is the one that many are afraid to even mention, and very few understand.\nThis is about the most shocking revelation I have seen in a while. I have looked for evidence to support and confirm this, and have found it. It is the only thing that makes sense for several reason that I will tell you as we go. I say that because if the Lord does not forgive the sin of blasphemy against the Holy Ghost, neither of us will make it to heaven.\nIf we understand the sin of blasphemy against the Holy Ghost, we will better understand why Mary is given special attention in this revelation.\nWhen you are in love, you will do what you have to do to please your beloved. You try very hard to be very honest with him or her. You never tell him or her anything you do not mean but you sometimes do tell them, “I told you so”, and “if only you had seen it my way”, or you feel you will “spare the rod” and cause them to see the error of their ways.\nThe devil will try to get you to do the same with God, but he will not succeed.\nYou would think it could as the people in this book do, but in this chapter we will see that it is not.\nWhat does it mean to you to believe He is real? Does it mean to you that you should give Him more attention? Does it mean that you should go to church as you once did? Does it mean that you should pray and read the Bible more? Does it make you a better person?\nDo you believe that He really can help you in your life on earth, or was that just some talk? Do you really believe He can and will help you in the future, or is just something the church told you?\nIf you have done a lot of things for Him, were they really to please Him, and if not will it help to please Him for you to stop doing them?\nThe sin of blasphemy against the Holy Ghost is a very common sin, but we must understand what it really is.\nThis is about the Lord’s feelings toward it, the reason He can not forgive this sin, and about the things this will bring about.\nDo we not see how Mary is honored? She was the only one able to know the truth. Do we see how all those years she spent, in the quietness of prayer, without seeing any of what the Lord did in her day, she saw God’s love for her and his mercy and gave thanks for that love.\nDid we not see how that great prayer must have brought joy and peace to Her Soul? Did we not see how the Love of God was so strong in Mary that she did not see sin, but instead saw a love with which she could never be satisfied save in the service of her beloved?\nDid we not see all that love as the greatest gift that God could give her, yet she did not give it to Him?\nShe did not trust Him to come to her. She did not go to the Lord when He came. She could not even say “I am the servant of the Lord”.\nIt seems, like, the greatest gift of all is lost on us, when we could have the greatest gift in the world; if we only knew the gift was lost on us.\nDo we then see the purpose of the Lord’s Love in the matter? He wanted a Mother who trusted Him totally in the future. He also wanted her to live up to that love, but He did not wish her to give it away to a false religion.\nThe Love of the Lord is so great He could even forgive those who took from her the gift she was to give back to Him, if they repented of taking from her the gift He wanted to give her.\nThe same love is felt by Her Son, as he gives it back to Her in His Sacrifice upon the Cross. This gift, He would like to give it to Mary, but for the sake of the salvation of the world, He can not.\nWhy did he lose that love? Was it because he had no faith in the love he had, or because of his disobedience, which he knew was the one thing he truly loved?\nDid he not see that if he had faith in that love He would not do that? Did he not see that he was the one to take that thing away from Mary, and thus lost it all?\nHe was lost because He could no longer trust God to be true, to keep Mary safe forever, and to protect her from all harm when the time came. He had learned to hate God and to know His sin, but that did He know to be any less than God knew of sin.\nAnd why was this? Because if sin has power, so does the love of God, and the power is not in the sin itself, but in the love which is at war with sin.\nThe purpose of the Lord’s love in keeping Mary on earth in her own home, and in helping her to be faithful to the sacrifice she made, is so that He would have the honor of giving her back the gift He had once loved when she was born.\nWas He to be proud and to love her with a love He had loved in the past?\nWhy did He lose that love?\nHis obedience was disobedience; His faithlessness was faithfulness. He could not give himself with the love He loved.\nTherefore, if the Son of God has lost His love, what then shall we call this loss? We must understand it as He did.\nIf the son does not have the love of his father he is a disloyal and ungrateful servant, but when the son loses his love he becomes a traitor or rebel, who will leave you to the service of God, in exchange for the service of Satan, as the Lord did all who forsake Him and all who were lost and lost forever.\nWe have a new chance to understand what the Lord meant when He said, “I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life”. This is really a new and a bigger revelation about life and the Lord.\nThe Lord has told us His Love is not about the future, but about the past, the present, and the future.\nHis Love is for those who came to Him before they were, because when He told us our life could end in the future, it could also be a beginning."]], "filtered_resps": ["The first two of these posts are long and I wanted you to be able to read them.\nThese last two are shorter and I think you will gain a few very interesting thoughts.\nMy purpose in writing them is to help you see and experience that God’s mercy is infinite.

I have tried the following things and none have worked, so forgive me if I am missing/forgetting something.

However, knowledge is generated and utilized via a complex interaction of the knowledge generation process, knowledge sharing, knowledge creation and acquisition, knowledge storage and retrieval, and exploitation.\nThe role of technology in knowledge-based companies is a critical component in achieving a competitive advantage through knowledge creation. Knowledge management needs to be implemented, monitored and managed continuously in order for the company to be able to adapt to the dynamics of the marketplace. The organization needs to change in ways to deal with the complexity of creating and exploiting knowledge.

The injury may result from a build-up of lactic acid in the muscle tissues, so a warm shower or a hot bath (just don’t have a hot bath after a run!) will help to loosen the muscles.

He was a medical doctor at an infectious disease institute (which is great) but if I recall correctly he had a PhD in Public Health. This is a completely different discipline and I don’t even think he had any formal training in epidemiology which is the study of how diseases are spread (throughout his career his role has been more political, although in the current environment that may be about to change). \n\nThere is also a really important question which has recently come up about Tedros receiving a pay rise of almost 200K USD.

How will they change the patient’s experience? How will they transform the provider’s experience? Which technology is best-suited for healthcare organizations? How can the industry keep up with these changes?\nWe recently sat down with James Vlasblom, the leader of IBM’s Healthcare & Life Sciences strategy and thought leadership, to discuss these questions and some of the top trends that will reshape the healthcare industry in 2018.\nQ: What are big challenges for companies operating in the healthcare industry?\nA: The healthcare industry continues to undergo transformations, specifically due to the technological improvements.\nI see the healthcare industry is a highly competitive industry to be in at the moment. We’re seeing major players moving into the industry. And even in the past half a year, you’ve seen major players moving into the industry. We’re seeing the major payers like CVS, Walmart, and Amazon move into healthcare with their own solutions to take on the existing players.\nWe’re also seeing technology players such as Google, Apple, and Microsoft move their technologies to healthcare. We are witnessing the digital transformation. Digital transformation is a big trend. What we’re seeing with these companies is their focus on cloud transformation and big data analytics. This can be used to analyze large volumes of data to drive the digital transformation agenda.\nIt’s imperative for healthcare providers and organizations to understand the new emerging technologies and to start applying them for better services.\nQ: How can a service provider’s digital maturity impact the industry?\nA: Service providers need to evaluate the current capability set. They need to check where they are currently positioned. Digital maturity is a crucial element of transformation. It’s about your capabilities around delivering services from a customer perspective. Providers can deliver the services by leveraging the digital technologies. They can also enhance their current capabilities in the digital space to achieve better outcomes for the people and organizations.\nQ: What are the new trends that will transform the healthcare industry in 2018?\nA: There are three main trends for healthcare this year. The first one is about personalization, where you can personalize your experience. We are now at a point where you can customize healthcare. You can personalize it by location, by the provider, by your location, and how you are using the solutions. Providers and providers can give better services to their customers based on their location and how they want to take care of their healthcare needs.\nThe second trend is around predictive analytics and insights. This is about driving and improving the predictive and prescriptive model. Organizations can use the data that’s being collected from providers for patient data, for patients and providers, into healthcare. It will allow them to analyze the data to drive the insights and use to improve their patient-centric model.\nThe next one is around cognitive computing. Cognitive computing is about using artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and robotics to analyze data and drive insights.\nQ: Which technology is best-suited for healthcare organizations?\nA: I believe, in the healthcare world, there’s a need to integrate technologies across clinical systems, back-office systems, and business processes. One of the technologies that will help transform healthcare is artificial intelligence (AI). AI is based on human intelligence and can interact with other humans in different ways. AI can be applied in almost all the major areas in the healthcare industry. It’s particularly important for the service industry, for example, by understanding your business requirements and optimizing the outcomes.\nIn healthcare, there’s a lot of data analysis to be done to understand the needs of patients and providers. We can use these tools to understand the needs and to make predictions based on the information provided.\nAnother technology, for example, is the IBM Watson Health, which applies the science of AI to drive the decisions. The decision has to be made in real time to provide the information to healthcare providers. We can use AI to analyze the data to identify patterns. You can identify the patterns based on the information provided and make predictions.\nIBM provides the technology for a lot of healthcare solutions. We provide tools, analytics, and capabilities needed for healthcare providers to make better decisions. The next step is how we can extend these technologies to improve the patient experience.\nQ: How can the industry keep up with these changes?\nA: Healthcare providers and organizations need to take advantage of the new emerging technologies. Providers need to invest in the emerging technologies. They need to focus on their own digital transformations by improving the digital capabilities in the current transformation to take on the big players.\nThe industry should keep up by investing in different technologies to stay relevant and to provide innovative solutions to the healthcare industry. By investing in technology solutions, healthcare industry can improve the quality of services provided to patients and drive better outcomes.\nThe healthcare industry in the US is the largest employer of all occupations in the country. In fact, it employs almost 20% of the total employees in the country.\nWith healthcare industry being one of the fastest growing industries, it is important that a healthcare organization knows very well what factors are driving its success and failure.\nAnd, if it is taking advantage of new innovative technology solutions, it is a bonus."]], "filtered_resps": ["What are the new trends that will transform the global healthcare industry in the near future?

Many of us know Bill as a dedicated member of the WMC and MCM community, working for an important part of the community. It is very important to understand the role of this person. Read on.\nThe purpose of this document is to share my observations, experiences and knowledge of our industry so that all participants may take advantage of the opportunities presented by our growing industry.\nMy name is Bill Zeban. I have been in the automotive industry for over 20 years. I have owned two dealerships, been a manufacturer district sales manager with Ford Motor Company and have spent the last 7 years as the CEO and President of the World Motorsport Council, a professional membership and certification division of SEMA. This organization was established to give an alternative for car dealers and other individuals involved in the automotive aftermarket to show their professionalism in business and technical competency. In the past, the aftermarket focused on the manufacturer’s certification, which was a good idea but it did not allow for the participation of independent shops. We are a non stock or member based association. Certification is not only good reputation marketing but also provides a base to expand our industry.\nThere are some misconceptions that seem to arise regularly about SEMA, the aftermarket and other related organizations and industries. I will share my insight and expertise on how the aftermarket functions in hopes of clarifying some of these issues.\nOver the last several years, SEMA has grown at a much faster pace than the rest of the aftermarket. The automotive aftermarket is a $20 billion industry. SEMA is a relatively small part of that but it provides many benefits to our segment. In 2007, over 75 percent of SEMA revenue came from auto parts and service. The remainder of revenue is derived from product development and licensing. Approximately 75 percent of manufacturers that are represented at SEMA use this organization for research to improve their products and services to dealers. We also provide dealer education services, and we work on legislation that benefits our members and the aftermarket as a whole.\nMany people are afraid that SEMA will only benefit large auto service operations, but the aftermarket in general represents smaller businesses than you may think. The average size of a SEMA dealer is two cars. This means that almost a million shops are represented in our member and certified member base. So the majority of people that you see at SEMA are not the big giants that you may anticipate and they are a huge portion of our society. Some are so small that they are not even listed in the Dealer Locator.\nAnother misconception is that most people that are involved in the SEMA show are members. In fact, most members do not visit or display at this show. Many members, especially the larger manufacturers, have found different means of reaching customers and dealers during the year with promotions and dealer meetings. However there is a significant portion that attend the show to see what is new, talk with competitors and suppliers and take advantage of the networking opportunities. Dealers and other independent shops that are members of SEMA find that this show is very effective for their businesses. By attending the show, they are able to reach more dealers and customers than they would have reached by taking a traditional trip to Las Vegas.\nMany of the manufacturers that sell to the aftermarket are at SEMA on a regular basis. This group is the majority of the members in SEMA and it includes several large manufacturers of automotive parts, tools, accessories and equipment. The manufacturers have the majority of their employees at SEMA because it is a highly productive time for them, providing opportunities to view our members’ cars, make purchases and learn about marketing services for their business. The manufacturers also use the show to meet with their independent sales managers, dealers and their own distributor network all under one roof. It is hard to explain the value of this event to an outsider.\nWe are not just an industry organization; we are an industry event. As I said before, the aftermarket is a $20 billion industry. Many of the major companies in this business find it difficult to attend a single show that reaches that amount in revenue. There are several multi day events that our industry attends in Las Vegas. Our members that are also manufacturers also set up trade exhibits that cover a much smaller area. In fact, most of their exhibits are just outside the entrance of the SEMA show and are just as effective as having them in the SEMA show floor. If a manufacturer cannot use one of their representatives to attend SEMA, they have the option to send a car and a banner that has their name on it. These display methods save them money and allow for the participation of many more people than they could hire for an entire show.\nSEMA also hosts many side events to entertain people who are not manufacturers and to keep them busy during these events. One of the most popular events is the annual SEMA Show Auto Corral, which features car shows on Friday evening and all day Saturday. On Friday night the Show Auto Corral features special shows open just to members of the automotive industry. Most of the members at this show are also members of SEMA. The show features special car shows for manufacturers, manufacturers specials for independent car care show and SEMA Show Cars. This is also a very popular event that does not have a cost to attend and the entry fees are low.\nOther events include the SEMA Cares Charity Classic held at the SEMA Show in Las Vegas in conjunction with a car auction. Since its inception in 2004, the Cares Charity Classic has raised an astounding over $8 million for charities.\nThe SEMA Show is very intense for us. We do our best to protect the interests of our members at our events by putting in place strict codes of conduct to regulate behavior at our events. We are very serious in this matter. SEMA has provided special training to our members and employees so that these issues are taken seriously.\nSEMA, like many other organizations, is comprised of many different personalities from a wide range of backgrounds and professions. As in any group, you will have some folks that will not represent your best interests. The best example of this is a small but vocal group of people that attempt to use the association to gain favor. SEMA does not and will always have a reputation of protecting the interests of its members. This is our primary responsibility to the aftermarket.\nWe must realize that if some people would stop playing games and were more concerned with the value of the organization we would find we had the support of a lot more people.\nThere are other organizations that represent the aftermarket with the same professional standards that SEMA does. The major automotive association (AMA) does not serve the after market as a whole and has more of an auto parts focus, not just automotive performance parts.\nSince 2003, I have worked with the AMA in an effort to become more involved. The AMA and I have had three meetings in the last year that I know of and they seem very concerned with their members. At our first meeting, our association was being reviewed by the AMA to see if we would be qualified to become a member. At the second meeting, there was still not a clear answer and the AMA made some changes to their code requirements for membership. To say that a code of ethics does not work or is not necessary is not the case with SEMA. We have to constantly be on guard to keep the right kind of people from joining our organization.\nSince my meeting with the AMA board, I have continued to see a lack of understanding of the difference between SEMA and the AMA and that SEMA provides a better quality membership and a level of service that the AMA cannot provide. There have been several recent instances where AMA members have approached us about membership issues. It is very discouraging for SEMA to see how some people are misrepresenting our association to members. It also makes you aware of those that don’t understand what a level of commitment it takes for our association to be successful.\nIt is easy for someone to tell you what is good about an organization in one sentence. After that, things go downhill. For that reason, I decided to go into detail about what we do and why we do it, so you may see how much work goes into our association.\nWe do not have the time or the resources to respond to questions for every company that has a problem or just needs to talk. We can only take care of the requests that are submitted to us through our website. We have received several calls and written letters from companies outside our organization. I have never seen a website or association that has as much information as ours, but there is no reason to have access to our member or dealer service data or to ask us questions. The most important reason is that we are a professional membership association and we take very seriously the responsibilities of preserving our reputation.\nI feel that you are not only the first point of contact for a company that has any issue with SEMA. You act as the main communicator with the company for that company and can answer a lot of the questions that are asked of us. As the first point of contact, you seem to see our organization through a different lens. All it takes is a few positive or negative responses to start making a name for your service or your company. I know this because I have seen it happen on several occasions and that also happens all the time on the Internet and when I go on the SEMA website!\nOur website is always being upgraded and we have added a members’ area where everyone can update or add to their existing content. We have added a page that is updated by the AMA to show the code of ethics which has been passed on by the association. The code of ethics is only something that AMA members should be concerned with, and we are still waiting to see who the next group"]], "filtered_resps": ["I have received the following article from Bill Zeban, who has passed it to me to share with the rest of you.

My friend did go down there to get those stickers etc. He went to the roof and there was no stickers for sale, but if you look at the roof there are a few spots you will see the roof is sloped, and has no tiles.\nI saw a few guys going to the roof. So, I went. I figured it would be the same thing. So I don't know if you got it but there was only stickers. No shirts. And all the others were just regular pictures. I think that place is pretty cool tho.\nI thought that was the same place they're in the video with the stickers... They did like a live stream of them all going there and I saw a lot of people. I dont know if that was the main sticker place and they put some on there, but I wasnt impressed by the number that was there.\nI know of a lot of people that went to the show in the last couple months and found stickers while they were there.\nYup, I went a little while ago and got one of those. Heh.\nWell, there are these cool stickers around here, and they are cool, the only problem is that the sticker has its own label, you can't tell what it is. So I went to the store which had the sticker, and found some stickers of these stickers, and they have a label, and I'm sure you will see a lot of people wearing them.\nI see that in their store."], "doc_hash": "45e3c16e2afcebba5bad6d617efcfd4260f74a2bcf0312b9bf9fa032f8dc294a", "prompt_hash": "3d0c1cf596181258a003e9f95c836c765d44353532e67c70d7dff48b05f64840", "target_hash": "e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855", "bypass": null}

However, there are numerous soft skills that can be learned as well. To better your chances of securing the position of your choice, you should acquire these skills.\nThese skills are important for a job seeker’s success. These skills not only help you stand out from the crowd. Even if you are seeking a job where your work experience is all that is required, soft skills can prove to be just as important as technical skills.\nIf you’re not sure how to improve your soft skills, you may need to get some outside help. Our team at Cielo has the expertise and experience to assist you in improving your soft skills and, as a result, your chances of landing that perfect job.\nHard Skills – Hard skills refer to any skills relevant to the job you are applying for, ranging from programming languages to accounting principles. Since it is easier to teach individuals hard skills, they are more useful than soft skills.\nSoft Skills – These are attributes that are more difficult to teach. They refer to how you conduct yourself in your daily interpersonal interactions in a variety of settings. These skills are difficult to quantify and evaluate, but having them will set you apart as an employee. Soft skills are extremely beneficial to job applicants since they help to improve the candidate’s ability to interact positively with employees and management, and are valued by corporate leaders in a wide range of industries, both in the United States and abroad.\nInterpersonal Skills: These skills can be acquired through training and are useful in any workplace. They are essential for teamwork, as they help to establish trust in one’s ability to interact with coworkers and clients. The most difficult skills to learn are communication skills, such as active listening skills, or how to interact with other team members in an interpersonal or group setting. In fact, active listening skill is very difficult. You must be able to hear other people and truly understand what they have to say in order to truly listen effectively.\nA critical component of interpersonal skills is the ability to communicate clearly. It is difficult to have a conversation with other people without communicating effectively. The ability to effectively resolve conflicts is essential for any job position or organization. It can be difficult to stay calm and avoid getting agitated in the most difficult situations, but it is necessary. Having good communication skills can help you resolve conflicts in a manner that is both productive and efficient.\nOther interpersonal skills that can be developed include the ability to motivate others, to effectively delegate tasks, and to work well as part of a team or leader. Motivation is a characteristic that sets you apart. It will determine the outcome of any project that you are assigned. Because motivation is so easy to acquire, it is often ignored by students and employees. It is important to understand that motivation can be learned, but it should be nurtured in order to achieve the highest possible results.\nDelegation skills are another critical skill. Delegation is the act of assigning tasks to someone else in order to free up your time for more important activities. One of the most common mistakes that are made in the workplace is that one employee will assign too many tasks or assignments but won’t follow through on what has been assigned. If one person becomes too involved in the assignment, it can make the whole team sluggish and unproductive. Other employees may not even understand what has been assigned to them, so there is no point in trying to implement new ideas. It is easy for one person or group to take over another’s workload, and it can cause resentment and a decreased level of trust between workers.\nTeamwork skills can come into play when a project requires more than one person. Because each individual has their own strengths and weaknesses, it is important to assign tasks based on what the team needs to accomplish. This is why it is important to train yourself and your employees how to work together as a team. When a team is organized and operates smoothly, productivity is increased and there are fewer employee turnovers. This means a better workplace for everyone.\nThe importance of customer service skills cannot be overestimated. A good customer service team is instrumental in the success of any business. In fact, it is necessary for the success of any organization in any service or business. Having good customer service skills can help you to effectively deal with customers, keep the customer happy and make sure that the product or service provided meets customer expectations.\nA customer service employee must be able to identify problems, make suggestions, and resolve issues quickly. This is done by asking the customer about his or her needs and expectations, then making suggestions and using resources to make sure that the product or service is delivered on time. Customer service representatives can do a large amount of research on their own, so they are highly valued. In addition, customer service representatives often receive recognition and promotions.\nAs you can see, soft skills are just as important as technical skills when it comes to finding and keeping a job. You will not only stand out from the crowd by showing off your communication skills, but you will impress other employees and leaders.\nIf you’re unsure about how to improve your soft skills and strengthen them, you’re in luck!

The proposal, announced by Europe’s Finance Ministers, has sparked a wave of reactions from industry stakeholders and policymakers alike, who’ve questioned the proposed move, its implications and the overall effect the regulatory scheme could have on crypto and Web3 ecosystems.\nThe proposed rules could have dramatic consequences for the crypto industry in Europe, making compliance to regulations a necessity to operate within the continent, requiring crypto services companies to adopt Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) protocols such as those introduced by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) recommendations, to comply with local laws.\nCrypto businesses must be able to maintain KYC and AML records and, due to their nature, they are often seen as inherently risky for money laundering, which can lead to the disruption of the entire business, and therefore, the overall development of the European crypto space.\nAlthough European authorities aren’t particularly welcoming to crypto, crypto-friendly nations like Malta and Switzerland are taking the lead in this industry, introducing laws to support the crypto community and boost digital assets’ adoption, while the UK appears to be lagging behind.\nAmidst growing regulatory pressure, European crypto businesses may look towards offshore jurisdictions that are less stringent when it comes to cryptocurrency regulation. For startups specifically, being able to operate freely or with very loose restrictions is what they value most, which is why jurisdictions such as Malta, Costa Rica, Singapore, Malta, Panama, and Switzerland attract a huge number of crypto projects every year.\nWhat exactly is the FATF, and, most importantly, who is impacted by this new regulatory framework?\nFATF, short for Financial Action Task Force, is a global regulatory body that sets standards to combat money laundering and other financial crimes.\nIn the crypto industry, the FATF has two main guidelines, one set of standards aimed at traditional financial institutions, and another, the Travel Rule standard, which regulates how crypto companies must comply with its guidelines or face heavy fine penalties.\nIn an effort to combat money laundering, FATF requires traditional financial institutions and crypto companies to maintain KYC, identify their users, and report suspicious transactions which could be related to money laundering or other fraudulent activities.\nHowever, FATF also requires traditional financial institutions to adhere to “travel” rules, which specify that “services providers must identify and share information about the payer of money and the beneficiary of money or virtual currency” when a transactional service like a wire transfer or a credit card payment occurs.\nThe implication of the FATF travel rule standard was that crypto was, for the first time, recognized as a means of payments, and as a result, as a target for AML/CTF purposes. As such, crypto-to-crypto transactions, and transfers from digital wallets, were now a target for AML/CTF verification, despite the fact that crypto is often used by people in countries with high numbers of unregulated or illegal financial activities, which have high risk levels for money laundering.\nRegulators in different jurisdictions may interpret the FATF standards in different ways, putting their national policies in conflict with international regulations, which is exactly what happened at the time with the EU, who tried to implement the FATF standards while they were still in progress and lacking any concrete definition.\nIn 2020, despite the continued lack of clarity regarding how to apply the FATF standards on crypto transactions, the EU took a step forward and adopted a proposal for a “market standard” that set a minimum level for AML/CTF regulation, in anticipation of more clarity from FATF.\nThe draft law, although aimed at all banks and financial institutions, can be interpreted by regulators as an attempt to apply regulations on crypto operators in the EU. The draft law would prohibit all digital asset service firms from accessing the European financial sector and operate within the EU without a license or a “PassPorting” mechanism. PassPorting is a regulatory mechanism that allows European authorized institutions the ability to provide services in another EU country. It is commonly used by financial institutions in the crypto space as a way to bypass regulations in other jurisdictions.\nHowever, the fact that crypto businesses are not currently required to follow AML/CTF policies already in place in many jurisdictions puts crypto at a disadvantage when compared to traditional financial institutions operating in the same jurisdiction. Therefore regulators may view the crypto sector too risky for AML/CTF compliance if they are operating independently.\nThe EU proposal has been met with significant backlash by the crypto industry.\nAmong the main criticisms of the proposal is that the EU’s current draft law lacks clarity.\nThe vagueness of the proposal makes it difficult for crypto businesses to gauge what policies they must follow, and whether they can benefit from the same regulatory systems used by traditional financial institutions.\nThe lack of clarity also makes it difficult for EU authorities to understand what cryptocurrency businesses can offer, and, therefore, how their financial assets can be properly regulated, which is also why crypto companies are now looking elsewhere for opportunities in less onerous jurisdictions.\nIf the current proposal is approved by the European Parliament, which has yet to be approved, crypto companies operating in the EU face heavy obstacles and potential disruption of their businesses.\nFor crypto businesses operating in the EU, complying with AML/CTF policies and the European market standards is mandatory if they want to stay operational in the EU, or access EU financial markets for both fiat and crypto services.\nThere are numerous crypto service providers operating in Germany, but there are other countries with more lenient crypto regulations, such as Austria, Malta, Switzerland, and even Singapore whose stringent compliance policies will attract more crypto companies in the future.\nIt’s clear that the crypto industry needs to be regulated, but how the regulations are applied, and the actual implications could mean the difference between a thriving business and the complete cessation of operations."]], "filtered_resps": ["In December, the European Commission announced its plans to propose new legislation that would regulate crypto-assets under the same terms as conventional financial services and products.

PassPorting is a regulatory mechanism that allows European authorized institutions the ability to provide services in another EU country. It is commonly used by financial institutions in the crypto space as a way to bypass regulations in other jurisdictions.\nHowever, the fact that crypto businesses are not currently required to follow AML/CTF policies already in place in many jurisdictions puts crypto at a disadvantage when compared to traditional financial institutions operating in the same jurisdiction. Therefore regulators may view the crypto sector too risky for AML/CTF compliance if they are operating independently.\nThe EU proposal has been met with significant backlash by the crypto industry.\nAmong the main criticisms of the proposal is that the EU’s current draft law lacks clarity.\nThe vagueness of the proposal makes it difficult for crypto businesses to gauge what policies they must follow, and whether they can benefit from the same regulatory systems used by traditional financial institutions.\nThe lack of clarity also makes it difficult for EU authorities to understand what cryptocurrency businesses can offer, and, therefore, how their financial assets can be properly regulated, which is also why crypto companies are now looking elsewhere for opportunities in less onerous jurisdictions.\nIf the current proposal is approved by the European Parliament, which has yet to be approved, crypto companies operating in the EU face heavy obstacles and potential disruption of their businesses.\nFor crypto businesses operating in the EU, complying with AML/CTF policies and the European market standards is mandatory if they want to stay operational in the EU, or access EU financial markets for both fiat and crypto services.\nThere are numerous crypto service providers operating in Germany, but there are other countries with more lenient crypto regulations, such as Austria, Malta, Switzerland, and even Singapore whose stringent compliance policies will attract more crypto companies in the future.\nIt’s clear that the crypto industry needs to be regulated, but how the regulations are applied, and the actual implications could mean the difference between a thriving business and the complete cessation of operations."], "doc_hash": "45e3c16e2afcebba5bad6d617efcfd4260f74a2bcf0312b9bf9fa032f8dc294a", "prompt_hash": "3d0c1cf596181258a003e9f95c836c765d44353532e67c70d7dff48b05f64840", "target_hash": "e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855", "bypass": null}

Writing advice often takes the form of \"do this, not that.\" So, what are some examples of telling?\n\nI think, by telling, I mean information that the character would know, if they happened to be sharing their thoughts. I think of it as information that isn't obvious to the reader, but is obvious to the character.\n\nI don't understand why we have rules against telling, though. Telling, I can see, is very different from showing. It's easy to demonstrate that the character knows the information. But what's actually so wrong with telling that we must be warned against it? And also, is all telling automatically bad?\n\nI understand that often times saying a thing is not as interesting to a reader as showing it. A character doing something, and it resulting in some consequence or other can be more interesting for a reader, than sitting through the character saying a thing and it being just as obvious to the reader. And I know of times, myself, when I've used information my characters are aware of, in order to move the plot forward, instead of showing them doing something.\n\nBut then, I often ask myself if, for the sake of moving things forward, it isn't better to use showing. That is, showing instead of telling or using a different device to describe it (e.g. showing through dialogue, or using a character to repeat the words, even though the character is already aware of it.) I'll ask myself if it isn't better to tell a thing once or twice so I can get it done, instead of using a device, or even better, putting it as dialogue - for which the character would say it. Or would it be better to just use the device or character, so I don't bother anyone with so much telling?\n\nMy thought on things is that sometimes, the rules against telling are just that - some people making rules. And, the rules aren't something you must follow in every case. So, when I see someone saying the story is told instead of shown, I do wonder if the person might be overdoing it - to the extent that telling does become boring.\n\nAs a counter-point, I am a little afraid of writing things in the style of some writers I admire. They don't tend to use many devices to show events, but instead use the simple, matter-of-fact way they tell things. For instance, one I really like, Steven Erikson, will just go ahead and describe something, without putting any filter in front of it. In contrast, say, I might be hesitant to say something like: \"Djall took his axe out of the hole he had burned in the floor, and threw it into the flames.\" I realize the person knows what just happened, but I wonder - can I express the information I want to convey, in another way that isn't so telling?\n\nAgain, here I want to address the caveats I mentioned earlier. In this post, I do realize that sometimes the rules against doing certain things are there for good reason. That sometimes, even though two people might know the same thing, one person might choose to tell it to another, and for good reason. And yes, sometimes, one might even choose to tell someone they are telling them something, rather than to show them.\n\nMaybe, in contrast to what I often read, for good reason, people do choose telling over showing or another device in order to move things along. I'm not saying they don't have a reason. It's just, I wonder if they are doing it too often, or too strongly.\n\nI know telling has both its bad points, and when you know it can be bad, it is often a good idea either to avoid telling, or do it sparingly. But that is all. In this post, I just want to have discussion. Do any of you think, or know, what makes telling bad?

At the same time, the company is also expanding its range to include new plug-in hybrid models.\nTwo years ago, Porsche and Volkswagen Group subsidiary Cupra announced a partnership to develop plug-in hybrid versions of upcoming models from the Porsche sports car manufacturer. Now Cupra has announced the brand’s first all-electric model from the middle of next year: an SUV called Formentor.\nThe Cupra model is positioned as an alternative to the Tesla Model Y and will be built in a newly built factory in Martorell, Spain for Cupra and the Volkswagen Group. Cupra will also offer performance vehicles based on the Porsche Panamera and Taycan in future.\nBut it is the Porsche segment that is also likely to be one of the most promising and fastest growing parts of the business in future. With the 918 Spyder and Taycan, the sports car manufacturer has already implemented a very successful start to electric propulsion to date.\nThe electrification of the range is now being continued: after the Taycan – which is available with various output levels – the company wants to follow the Panamera and Macan with plug-in hybrid models at the end of 2020. The Cayenne and 992 generation Turbo should of course also receive a plug-in hybrid version.\nThe Porsche Panamera and Cayenne plug-in hybrid models are said to offer a range of electric driving of more than 100 kilometres. The top-of-the-range Panamera Turbo S E-Hybrid will be equipped with a petrol engine from the V8 family, as well as a large high-capacity battery.\nThese should enable a driving range of 600 kilometers, and the maximum output of 600 hp should be a bit above the Panamera 4 in terms of performance. These are the figures that you are currently not used to with Porsche models.\nAlso interesting: how dangerous is the Chinese CoroVirus for us?\nWhile the Panamera has lost some of its sporting flair, the new Cayenne will appear as a more athletic model with significantly tighter proportions. The all-electric e-Taycan has been on the US market since summer 2020.\nR&D: how dangerous is the Chinese CoroVirus for us?\nThe Taycan’s range is just under 480 km, which is around twice as long as the Tesla Model S’s range and more than 40 percent longer than the next model in the premium electric segment, the Audi E-Tron. It also has the advantage of quick refueling times: according to the WLTP certification criteria, the Taycan takes around half an hour for a recharge to 80 percent. The E-Tron, with a 90 kWh battery, reaches the same level after an hour.\nPorsche expects to launch more than 100 electrified models by 2025, while by 2030 its annual sales of electrified and battery-powered vehicles should reach one billion. But the company also wants to remain flexible – the 911, for example, can still be purchased with a gasoline engine.\nThe sports car manufacturer does not want to be a player in the electric car market in the coming years. That is why Porsche wants to be more flexible by combining electric propulsion with combustion engine technology. The future model for everyday use thus becomes a hybrid.\nWhile the Porsche Cayenne has been the model for electric drive for a long time, the 911 and Macan have to wait a little longer. When production of the mid-engined sports car, which was recently named the world’s most beautiful sports car for the ninth time, will finally move from Zuffenhausen to Leipzig, Porsche is said to have decided on an additional plug-in hybrid variant.\nThis top-of-the-line variant would be the first electrified variant of the 911 as well, which is why the future model range would also receive a plug-in hybrid variant for the first time. For the first time at the beginning of the next decade, Porsche is therefore considering a vehicle that combines an electric propulsion system with a combustion engine.\nEven though the 911 is not exactly a newcomer to the scene, the car manufacturer must continue with the model. The 911 as the sporty flagship of the brand also represents Porsche’s commitment to its own technology platform. There is also the intention of expanding the range by plug-in hybrids, which are also to be deployed under the label 992.\nThe first information about the Cayman models for the next generation have already been announced: The front is said to be more upright than today and therefore also sportier, while the rear could benefit from a less aggressive character line.\nAt the same time, the next-generation 718 Boxster is already in the starting blocks. This model will also receive an electrically assisted mid-engine hybrid system, with a drive concept based on the Taycan and the Panamera Sports Turismo. These will be the first two plug-in hybrid sports cars of this type from Porsche. The mid-range sports car, for example, comes on the market from 2020 under the names 718 and 728.\nIn both models, the new 48-volt starter-generator should increase the maximum torque by 20 percent and increase the fuel efficiency by 15 percent. The electric sports car e-Boxter concept, presented at the 2013 Geneva Motor Show on a concept of the Cayman S, is also still at the stage of planning. One of the biggest challenges for the electric sports car is an impressive range. As the Taycan shows, a real 300 km range is no problem. With the Taycan, Porsche has succeeded in equipping the first sporty electric car with a range large enough to take over the daily trip without problems.\nWhat was missing in the electric car world at first was a second model that could actually come close to Porsche brand quality. But now two vehicles are coming from Porsche. It is still early to say how successful the products will be, but it is evident that Porsche is on the cutting edge of technology in the car market and intends to take a big step forward with the Taycan.\nThe company would not have introduced the Taycan if it hadn’t been a top-class product with all the technical details – such as charging, for example. Of course, the company is also not losing its independence in product development.

They didn't really care about truth in the least; they were driven by a passion to persecute and even kill Him.\nThen we move to those who didn't have an immediate problem with Him. They appreciated Him for what He was – and so they made the effort to come and actually listen to Him. At first, that was all they did – listen – before they dismissed Him. But they were willing to make the effort, and so they went on to do more.\nThat's where we are at this point in Mark. \"But He moved on through more cities and villages... until He reached his destination.\" If you recall, Jesus went to Jerusalem to start His public ministry where He went about carrying out the mission God had given His Son. When He got to Jordan, He was baptized by John who prepared Him to minister. Now He has gone throughout Galilee – He hasn't even spent a lot of time in Jerusalem – and they're continuing to listen... but they're continuing to be confused by just what they're hearing.\nI am convinced that Jesus didn't have any problem talking with those who were simply curious. His problem was with those who did not want to hear; who had a different agenda; who were driven by an agenda to see Christ crucified again – as they viewed it.\nI do not know how many will see this sermon series as relevant today since we are in the midst of the coronavirus and social distancing. I have no idea how this disease will turn out or how much worse it might become. But one thing I do know and that is if the current problem continues we need to find different ways to connect.\nI believe and have always believed that churches need to find ways to connect with people in a virtual way. For us that means having online services on Sunday morning and having them available on video later in the day so people can view them if they want. But there should be other ways to maintain that connection and I think we'll find out as the days continue.\nIn the meantime, for me it is not as important what we're going through now as it is where do churches go from here – what can they still have on Sunday morning that people can view online to get connected.\nAs I look at it today, the important part for us as churches is how will we meet people's needs online rather than in person? It could be about something as simple as putting video on the website or making a video available in social media for people to watch later, or, if a church is equipped to do livestreaming, we can put them up there on a regular basis and hopefully people will feel more connected as a result.\nNow in the midst of all of that, we are continuing our series based on Mark's gospel. So far Mark's gospel is a series of events; and in this series it has been in a somewhat reverse chronological order. Now he goes back to what he considered the key point of Jesus's ministry and that would be the beginning.\nLast week, Mark finished the account of Jesus being questioned by some Jews in Jerusalem because He had healed some on the Sabbath. Although we know that Jesus did a fair amount of His healing ministry on the Sabbath so as to get this message out, this incident is unique. Mark has never given any account of what happened, and he goes into a fair amount of detail of Jesus' response. In the process he makes some very important points.\nIn that incident Jesus does something that the religious leaders found extremely offensive. He was healing on the Sabbath. He healed the man with the ear. He healed him through healing the man with the sick. He was taking this most basic physical need of all and, not only taking care of it but restoring it, or even perhaps restoring him to his normal self. That's what He showed the man he needed – that his ear was healed enough to be attached once again. That's what He was doing.\nAnd so Mark tells that He healed him and he had so much compassion on him that He healed him so that he could be a witness to what God wants people to be – restored and re-connected. And he was also a witness at the same time to why this needed to be changed and that was to provide testimony to what God has done. And so Mark is telling us that Jesus did this to provide testimony about what Jesus did so they would remember in the days to come what He did about His ministry on the Sabbath.\nNow that's kind of where we are going to pick up today. In the account of that healing last week, Mark told us some of what He said – but now we're going to go deeper into what He said to them.\nI believe that in this scene what He said to them was one of the most significant things that He ever said and was one of the most significant things that He ever taught anyone. Although it has been written down by His disciples and the disciples that gathered around Him, the world at large, with the exception of a very few followers, has forgotten His teachings and He was saying such profound things that people would find difficult to understand it in a short period of time. They would have to learn and spend time together for people to get the understanding, but He still continued to teach them.\nSo in this scene we get a little insight into the mindset of the Jews at this time, which is a mindset that has never been completely removed. Jesus's response to what He said in Mark 3:4, you remember, was for them to be offended. And if He could only get them to understand it and not be offended, then they would be saved and they would understand and they would see the truth and the way things ought to be.\n\"The disciples said to Him, 'Teacher, we know that you are true and care for no one. You have no respect for the high official because you care for no one. \nIn other words, the Jewish leadership has a perception of who Jesus is. Jesus isn't just a Galilean; He's from Nazareth – Nazareth of Galilee. They say He's the product of the low end of Israel. They are very sure that Jesus is a person who is the ultimate hypocrite. The fact is the Jews knew that if they did anything on the Sabbath they could be prosecuted. That was the law. So, Jesus is a hypocrite because He is being a hypocrite; He's breaking the law, and He's doing it on the Sabbath.\nThen there is the fact that His disciples are plucking heads of grain. The fact is He is breaking the law by not letting them gather grains to satisfy their physical need. Now that is not the full story of the law of the Sabbath. For instance, the command to work on the Sabbath is for one's physical needs, and God has given us what's necessary for our needs and He has permitted it. And that's just one aspect of why they were breaking the law.\nBut that is a law that they are very sure that Christ is in violation of. The fact that Christ allowed His disciple to pluck grain and eat it shows, again, that He is in violation of the law.\nBut that's not all about the Sabbath – that's just a portion of what He said about what the Sabbath is for. He is making a much more profound point. First of all, Jesus says, \"In what way is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or bad?\" Jesus is asking because it seemed to be that the way He was doing these works was not done with their authority so that He would make a clear point about what He's teaching.\nThis is just a short bit of an explanation about how the Sabbath is for us to do good for others and not for Christ to be violating the law – for us to be obeying it. And as it turned out, He had just performed an amazing action with His disciples. First of all, if people broke the Sabbath law and were seen by others, they would be stoned without question. In the midst of breaking the Sabbath law, He allowed His disciples to pluck grain. He has just done an amazing thing. In fact, they say He is making a mockery of the Sabbath because He permits them to pluck the heads of grain, which is breaking the law.\nNow the question is: What law did they break? The answer is the law on the Sabbath concerning work. They were permitted to gather grain. But they were supposed to make sure they gathered enough grain for their physical needs for the Sabbath and they were not, from the context, plucking the heads of grain and collecting them for their physical needs – unless they were plucking that grain to be eaten.\nThe Pharisees had a good legal case that Jesus was breaking the law because, in the culture, it was very difficult at certain times to get through the day and do anything physical at all if you didn't have some food for a meal. So they said that they were only plucking the head of grain. They said that they were not going to pluck the grain until the end of the Sabbath. However, He said He would not be the judge on whether that interpretation was right, or whether it was wrong. And He said, \"Is it lawful to do good on the Sabbath?\"\nIn verse 18 when He quotes from Isaiah, He is quoting from the \"Prophets\" not from the Old Testament but from Isaiah. When he mentions the Prophets, in the original text it said \"the prophets.\" The text uses \"the prophets\" as a collective noun.\nIn the original text it uses a plural noun, \"the Law.\" The text"]], "filtered_resps": ["At first it seemed to me that we would not get any further than those who first heard Him – some of whom gave Him no more than a casual passing attention before they turned sharply away in disgust.

'Nocturne' is influenced by the 70's progressive rock bands of that era, particularly the work from German outfit Ash Ra Tempel, plus also taking its cue from the psychedelia of the 60's, hence the band name being taken from 'Dagon's Reef' an adventure novel by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, as with the album's title.\nOpening track 'Ocean Sea' is a short instrumental piece clocking in at under two minutes long which really set the scene, a slow paced track with gentle ambient guitar and soft beats before a subtle electric guitar melody kicks in accompanied by more gentle beats which then fades away. There is this sense of nostalgia to the track which is quite compelling and also features the album's only vocals and it also comes across as quite atmospheric and a nice introduction to the album.\n'Sublime' is up next which consists of a brief piano introduction before a fuller progressive rock sound kicks in with some catchy guitar melodies and intricate drum work, as well as this there are some lovely deep and atmospheric vocals from Johanna Nöstling, it's a track that has a laid back vibe and plenty of prog rock influences mixed with the 70's psychedelia. There's a hint of the progressive electronic outfit Avalon here to the track, in particular with some of the guitar work, and also some of the keyboard work feels reminiscent to the likes of ELO.\n'Nocturne' the title track carries on in a similar style to 'Sublime' with it's combination of 70's prog guitar riffs and more ambient and progressive tones of atmospheric keyboards, it's a good one to sink into and the vocals from Johanna Nöstling work well here. 'Nocturne' has an easy flowing pace to it and is quite a mellow piece of prog rock with this hypnotic feel to it, yet also not a track that relies just on atmosphere to carry it along as all the other elements like the keyboards do their job of creating a full sound and there is a good balance between the vocals and instrumentation here and everything is delivered with confidence.\n'Nocturne' (the title track) is a nice way to start the album as it has this laid back and dreamy feel to it, it's a nice and mellow way to start one's prog journey, and the soundscape which it brings is quite intoxicating. 'Nocturne' is a short piece of music yet it is a strong opener to the album, as with 'Nocturne' the rest of the album follows along with a similar feel and style to the opener and is perhaps a good way to immerse oneself within the 'Nocturne' universe. 'Nocturne' consists of the instrumental 'Nocturne' which is more like a mix of atmospheric ambience with melodic guitar, delicate piano and drum fills accompanied by Johanna Nöstling's vocals, plus it also has the added elements of what sounds like samples of spoken language and vocal effects which adds another dimension to the piece.\n'Noise' comes next and it's an upbeat and catchy piece of progressive rock which has this heavy rhythm to it, the guitar is full of rich reverb which it's delivered with in a way that's quite hypnotic and the bass is deep and full of groove, while a heavy riff adds to this. There is a real sense of groove and attitude to the track with some great interplay between the keyboards and guitar and there is a wonderful feel of old school prog rock here mixed with some heavy riffing and an edginess to it, all of which makes for an enjoyable rock tune.\n'Nocturne' is back for another go and there's not a lot of difference between this and 'Nocturne' apart from it's slightly shorter in length by a matter of seconds; with 'Nocturne' however there is more instrumentation on display, including flute, synths and drums, which helps make the track a little fuller and more colourful overall. There's not a dramatic difference in style and tempo between both versions of the track, so that is the only real reason 'Nocturne' becomes redundant and thus doesn't really add much to the album.\n'Escape' is the first track on the album which has an almost dance or techno feel to it, though it's actually quite upbeat and not dark or depressing, more on a funkier side of things. 'Escape' has some good funky bass lines to it along with a rhythmic drum beat and a good electric guitar riff which also has a great sound to it. 'Escape' has a groovy feel to it, which is rather nice and this song along with 'Noise' are the heavier tunes on the album.\n'Out There' is the final track on the album, as on 'Out There' from the very outset the song just oozes with this relaxed feel to it, in particular with this laid back electric guitar which has this nice reverb effect to it. Again there's a great groove here and while this track has this nice laid back feel to it, there's not much progression or development, as 'Out There' is more of the same as the preceding tracks in that regard, still there is a sense of quality to the track itself which makes it a solid way to end this album. It's another short piece of music, coming to just three minutes in length, and in comparison with the rest of the tracks on the album it feels like a kind of 'outtake' or something added on after the main sessions ended, but all the other tracks are good enough that this isn't an issue as 'Out There' is still a good way to end the album.\nThe one thing that immediately stands out and comes to mind about the 'Nocturne' album is how this feels like the work of a band that is on the cusp of producing a full album without much in the way of changes, which also goes to say that this is more of an album in it's early stages of completion or something which has yet to be finished.\nDagon The Reef are a trio from Stockholm, Sweden, consisting of three talented musicians Erik Nösta...\nDagon's Reef have released a new track titled 'Waste Of Life' as a preview to their upcoming full-...\nFollowing from the success of his debut album 'The Unseen' back in 2014, singer-songwriter Tim Bric...\nNew from the underground of the music world is the debut album entitled 'The Unseen' from singer-s...\nThe debut album from Danish based duo The Hive Mind is a concept album of epic proportions, a so..."]], "filtered_resps": ["We are pleased to release this second album from Swedish psychedelic prog-rock outfit Dagon's Reef called 'Nocturne' this October 8th, a 10 track collection which has been three years in the making, as well as having a completely new line up, the only original member being guitarist and composer Erik Nilsson.

Does it exist? Is it some mystical entity that is the essence of everything, including the soul, or is it the very act of existing, the physical state that exists in our bodies?\nFor the sake of this article, let us assume that the term \"the spirit\" means all of the aforementioned things. Let's assume also that the spirit is the state that exists on an unmanifested plane (I'm not exactly sure where that plane exists, but I do know that a soul lives in its own space of consciousness, separate from the body. All of this can be read in the books, including The Secret of the Spirit and The Seven Spiritual Laws.\nNow, we can use this idea to explain many things. First, let's look at the notion of death. People who believe in reincarnation say that this state of being continues forever, while people of the belief that we have only one life have a concept of eternity. The concept of eternity is based upon a belief that there is something that exists beyond this mortal existence and is therefore an impossible state to achieve. So who is right? Well, here's an idea. If you believe in the spirit, and that the body is the materialization of the spirit, not the other way around, then it would follow that death is the final state of consciousness for the conscious entity, or \"soul\" as it's often referred to. It's no longer possible to experience a physical body, which is essentially what you have on Earth. But what happens when that physical body stops functioning? Well, it's only the physical body, but the spirit persists, as long as it is in this plane of existence.

It's what makes the material body possible in the first place.\nAnd, it is in this state that we die, as it's the state of existence that is the most important, especially because it's the only way to go on in this world.

That is the meaning of life, the meaning of the spirit.\nI realize that my theory is not entirely new, as others have theorized about the same idea, which is what makes it so easy to see it in a different light. The idea of death, while it's not entirely true, is based upon the idea that we will all eventually \"end,\" while we are still on this Earth. As our minds become evermore complex, we are able to create a \"spirit,\" because we become evermore conscious of our own existence.\nWith the creation of the soul, we are able to achieve a certain state of consciousness, as it is our brain that gives us this state, rather than our body or even our soul. This is why you feel such great pain or pleasure, because we all have that \"spirit,\" that \"soul\" as it's often referred to.

When we understand it to be that way, our fear of being found guilty will be gone, our hope and love for him to be returned and our fear of death to be removed.\nWe will realize that He created us as “new creatures”, and that if we have repented, accepted Christ, obeyed the commandment to seek the Lord until He is found and repented in an act of true contrition (which many people think is to be as sincere as possible or to try harder), He has promised us “new hearts”, a clean slate, a full pardon, and complete freedom from all fears and regrets.\nWe will have a perfect relationship with God in heaven with the opportunity to ask Him for anything we have forgotten or thought we could never ask Him to do.\nOne little story about Mary will show you what the Lord thinks of her.\nHe also does not accept those to Heaven who are guilty of the sin against the Holy Ghost, although this sin is the one that many are afraid to even mention, and very few understand.\nThis is about the most shocking revelation I have seen in a while. I have looked for evidence to support and confirm this, and have found it. It is the only thing that makes sense for several reason that I will tell you as we go. I say that because if the Lord does not forgive the sin of blasphemy against the Holy Ghost, neither of us will make it to heaven.\nIf we understand the sin of blasphemy against the Holy Ghost, we will better understand why Mary is given special attention in this revelation.\nWhen you are in love, you will do what you have to do to please your beloved. You try very hard to be very honest with him or her. You never tell him or her anything you do not mean but you sometimes do tell them, “I told you so”, and “if only you had seen it my way”, or you feel you will “spare the rod” and cause them to see the error of their ways.\nThe devil will try to get you to do the same with God, but he will not succeed.\nYou would think it could as the people in this book do, but in this chapter we will see that it is not.\nWhat does it mean to you to believe He is real? Does it mean to you that you should give Him more attention? Does it mean that you should go to church as you once did? Does it mean that you should pray and read the Bible more? Does it make you a better person?\nDo you believe that He really can help you in your life on earth, or was that just some talk? Do you really believe He can and will help you in the future, or is just something the church told you?\nIf you have done a lot of things for Him, were they really to please Him, and if not will it help to please Him for you to stop doing them?\nThe sin of blasphemy against the Holy Ghost is a very common sin, but we must understand what it really is.\nThis is about the Lord’s feelings toward it, the reason He can not forgive this sin, and about the things this will bring about.\nDo we not see how Mary is honored? She was the only one able to know the truth. Do we see how all those years she spent, in the quietness of prayer, without seeing any of what the Lord did in her day, she saw God’s love for her and his mercy and gave thanks for that love.\nDid we not see how that great prayer must have brought joy and peace to Her Soul? Did we not see how the Love of God was so strong in Mary that she did not see sin, but instead saw a love with which she could never be satisfied save in the service of her beloved?\nDid we not see all that love as the greatest gift that God could give her, yet she did not give it to Him?\nShe did not trust Him to come to her. She did not go to the Lord when He came. She could not even say “I am the servant of the Lord”.\nIt seems, like, the greatest gift of all is lost on us, when we could have the greatest gift in the world; if we only knew the gift was lost on us.\nDo we then see the purpose of the Lord’s Love in the matter? He wanted a Mother who trusted Him totally in the future. He also wanted her to live up to that love, but He did not wish her to give it away to a false religion.\nThe Love of the Lord is so great He could even forgive those who took from her the gift she was to give back to Him, if they repented of taking from her the gift He wanted to give her.\nThe same love is felt by Her Son, as he gives it back to Her in His Sacrifice upon the Cross. This gift, He would like to give it to Mary, but for the sake of the salvation of the world, He can not.\nWhy did he lose that love? Was it because he had no faith in the love he had, or because of his disobedience, which he knew was the one thing he truly loved?\nDid he not see that if he had faith in that love He would not do that? Did he not see that he was the one to take that thing away from Mary, and thus lost it all?\nHe was lost because He could no longer trust God to be true, to keep Mary safe forever, and to protect her from all harm when the time came. He had learned to hate God and to know His sin, but that did He know to be any less than God knew of sin.\nAnd why was this? Because if sin has power, so does the love of God, and the power is not in the sin itself, but in the love which is at war with sin.\nThe purpose of the Lord’s love in keeping Mary on earth in her own home, and in helping her to be faithful to the sacrifice she made, is so that He would have the honor of giving her back the gift He had once loved when she was born.\nWas He to be proud and to love her with a love He had loved in the past?\nWhy did He lose that love?\nHis obedience was disobedience; His faithlessness was faithfulness. He could not give himself with the love He loved.\nTherefore, if the Son of God has lost His love, what then shall we call this loss? We must understand it as He did.\nIf the son does not have the love of his father he is a disloyal and ungrateful servant, but when the son loses his love he becomes a traitor or rebel, who will leave you to the service of God, in exchange for the service of Satan, as the Lord did all who forsake Him and all who were lost and lost forever.\nWe have a new chance to understand what the Lord meant when He said, “I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life”. This is really a new and a bigger revelation about life and the Lord.\nThe Lord has told us His Love is not about the future, but about the past, the present, and the future.\nHis Love is for those who came to Him before they were, because when He told us our life could end in the future, it could also be a beginning."]], "filtered_resps": ["The first two of these posts are long and I wanted you to be able to read them.\nThese last two are shorter and I think you will gain a few very interesting thoughts.\nMy purpose in writing them is to help you see and experience that God’s mercy is infinite. When we understand it to be that way, our fear of being found guilty will be gone, our hope and love for him to be returned and our fear of death to be removed.\nWe will realize that He created us as “new creatures”, and that if we have repented, accepted Christ, obeyed the commandment to seek the Lord until He is found and repented in an act of true contrition (which many people think is to be as sincere as possible or to try harder), He has promised us “new hearts”, a clean slate, a full pardon, and complete freedom from all fears and regrets.\nWe will have a perfect relationship with God in heaven with the opportunity to ask Him for anything we have forgotten or thought we could never ask Him to do.\nOne little story about Mary will show you what the Lord thinks of her.\nHe also does not accept those to Heaven who are guilty of the sin against the Holy Ghost, although this sin is the one that many are afraid to even mention, and very few understand.\nThis is about the most shocking revelation I have seen in a while. I have looked for evidence to support and confirm this, and have found it. It is the only thing that makes sense for several reason that I will tell you as we go. I say that because if the Lord does not forgive the sin of blasphemy against the Holy Ghost, neither of us will make it to heaven.\nIf we understand the sin of blasphemy against the Holy Ghost, we will better understand why Mary is given special attention in this revelation.\nWhen you are in love, you will do what you have to do to please your beloved. You try very hard to be very honest with him or her. You never tell him or her anything you do not mean but you sometimes do tell them, “I told you so”, and “if only you had seen it my way”, or you feel you will “spare the rod” and cause them to see the error of their ways.\nThe devil will try to get you to do the same with God, but he will not succeed.\nYou would think it could as the people in this book do, but in this chapter we will see that it is not.\nWhat does it mean to you to believe He is real? Does it mean to you that you should give Him more attention? Does it mean that you should go to church as you once did? Does it mean that you should pray and read the Bible more? Does it make you a better person?\nDo you believe that He really can help you in your life on earth, or was that just some talk? Do you really believe He can and will help you in the future, or is just something the church told you?\nIf you have done a lot of things for Him, were they really to please Him, and if not will it help to please Him for you to stop doing them?\nThe sin of blasphemy against the Holy Ghost is a very common sin, but we must understand what it really is.\nThis is about the Lord’s feelings toward it, the reason He can not forgive this sin, and about the things this will bring about.\nDo we not see how Mary is honored? She was the only one able to know the truth. Do we see how all those years she spent, in the quietness of prayer, without seeing any of what the Lord did in her day, she saw God’s love for her and his mercy and gave thanks for that love.\nDid we not see how that great prayer must have brought joy and peace to Her Soul? Did we not see how the Love of God was so strong in Mary that she did not see sin, but instead saw a love with which she could never be satisfied save in the service of her beloved?\nDid we not see all that love as the greatest gift that God could give her, yet she did not give it to Him?\nShe did not trust Him to come to her.

However, DOMS is an issue after exercise that most people will experience at some point, it’s quite normal and is often not a cause for concern.\nWhilst walking, make sure you take smaller steps.\nStand upright and stretch your hamstrings, quads and calves.\nGently roll the balls of your feet when you get up.\nWalk for a minute or two if it’s not possible to go to the gym.\nDon’t force yourself to exercise when you’re feeling overstretched.\nListen to your body and if it doesn’t feel right, try again a few days later.

Some people may find that stretching the muscles does help a bit whilst others find that this makes the situation worse. If stretching makes the DOMS worse consult a professional for advice. The injury may result from a build-up of lactic acid in the muscle tissues, so a warm shower or a hot bath (just don’t have a hot bath after a run!) will help to loosen the muscles. Another tip is to massage the sore areas with some light pressure – never dig into the muscle too deep as you could strain it further.

How will they change the patient’s experience? How will they transform the provider’s experience? Which technology is best-suited for healthcare organizations? How can the industry keep up with these changes?\nWe recently sat down with James Vlasblom, the leader of IBM’s Healthcare & Life Sciences strategy and thought leadership, to discuss these questions and some of the top trends that will reshape the healthcare industry in 2018.\nQ: What are big challenges for companies operating in the healthcare industry?\nA: The healthcare industry continues to undergo transformations, specifically due to the technological improvements.\nI see the healthcare industry is a highly competitive industry to be in at the moment. We’re seeing major players moving into the industry. And even in the past half a year, you’ve seen major players moving into the industry. We’re seeing the major payers like CVS, Walmart, and Amazon move into healthcare with their own solutions to take on the existing players.\nWe’re also seeing technology players such as Google, Apple, and Microsoft move their technologies to healthcare. We are witnessing the digital transformation. Digital transformation is a big trend. What we’re seeing with these companies is their focus on cloud transformation and big data analytics. This can be used to analyze large volumes of data to drive the digital transformation agenda.\nIt’s imperative for healthcare providers and organizations to understand the new emerging technologies and to start applying them for better services.\nQ: How can a service provider’s digital maturity impact the industry?\nA: Service providers need to evaluate the current capability set. They need to check where they are currently positioned. Digital maturity is a crucial element of transformation. It’s about your capabilities around delivering services from a customer perspective. Providers can deliver the services by leveraging the digital technologies. They can also enhance their current capabilities in the digital space to achieve better outcomes for the people and organizations.\nQ: What are the new trends that will transform the healthcare industry in 2018?\nA: There are three main trends for healthcare this year. The first one is about personalization, where you can personalize your experience. We are now at a point where you can customize healthcare. You can personalize it by location, by the provider, by your location, and how you are using the solutions. Providers and providers can give better services to their customers based on their location and how they want to take care of their healthcare needs.\nThe second trend is around predictive analytics and insights. This is about driving and improving the predictive and prescriptive model. Organizations can use the data that’s being collected from providers for patient data, for patients and providers, into healthcare. It will allow them to analyze the data to drive the insights and use to improve their patient-centric model.\nThe next one is around cognitive computing. Cognitive computing is about using artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and robotics to analyze data and drive insights.\nQ: Which technology is best-suited for healthcare organizations?\nA: I believe, in the healthcare world, there’s a need to integrate technologies across clinical systems, back-office systems, and business processes. One of the technologies that will help transform healthcare is artificial intelligence (AI). AI is based on human intelligence and can interact with other humans in different ways. AI can be applied in almost all the major areas in the healthcare industry. It’s particularly important for the service industry, for example, by understanding your business requirements and optimizing the outcomes.\nIn healthcare, there’s a lot of data analysis to be done to understand the needs of patients and providers. We can use these tools to understand the needs and to make predictions based on the information provided.\nAnother technology, for example, is the IBM Watson Health, which applies the science of AI to drive the decisions. The decision has to be made in real time to provide the information to healthcare providers. We can use AI to analyze the data to identify patterns. You can identify the patterns based on the information provided and make predictions.\nIBM provides the technology for a lot of healthcare solutions. We provide tools, analytics, and capabilities needed for healthcare providers to make better decisions. The next step is how we can extend these technologies to improve the patient experience.\nQ: How can the industry keep up with these changes?\nA: Healthcare providers and organizations need to take advantage of the new emerging technologies. Providers need to invest in the emerging technologies. They need to focus on their own digital transformations by improving the digital capabilities in the current transformation to take on the big players.\nThe industry should keep up by investing in different technologies to stay relevant and to provide innovative solutions to the healthcare industry. By investing in technology solutions, healthcare industry can improve the quality of services provided to patients and drive better outcomes.\nThe healthcare industry in the US is the largest employer of all occupations in the country. In fact, it employs almost 20% of the total employees in the country.\nWith healthcare industry being one of the fastest growing industries, it is important that a healthcare organization knows very well what factors are driving its success and failure.\nAnd, if it is taking advantage of new innovative technology solutions, it is a bonus."]], "filtered_resps": ["What are the new trends that will transform the global healthcare industry in the near future?

This can be used to analyze large volumes of data to drive the digital transformation agenda.\nIt’s imperative for healthcare providers and organizations to understand the new emerging technologies and to start applying them for better services.\nQ: How can a service provider’s digital maturity impact the industry?\nA: Service providers need to evaluate the current capability set. They need to check where they are currently positioned. Digital maturity is a crucial element of transformation. It’s about your capabilities around delivering services from a customer perspective. Providers can deliver the services by leveraging the digital technologies. They can also enhance their current capabilities in the digital space to achieve better outcomes for the people and organizations.\nQ: What are the new trends that will transform the healthcare industry in 2018?\nA: There are three main trends for healthcare this year. The first one is about personalization, where you can personalize your experience. We are now at a point where you can customize healthcare. You can personalize it by location, by the provider, by your location, and how you are using the solutions. Providers and providers can give better services to their customers based on their location and how they want to take care of their healthcare needs.\nThe second trend is around predictive analytics and insights. This is about driving and improving the predictive and prescriptive model. Organizations can use the data that’s being collected from providers for patient data, for patients and providers, into healthcare. It will allow them to analyze the data to drive the insights and use to improve their patient-centric model.\nThe next one is around cognitive computing. Cognitive computing is about using artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and robotics to analyze data and drive insights.\nQ: Which technology is best-suited for healthcare organizations?\nA: I believe, in the healthcare world, there’s a need to integrate technologies across clinical systems, back-office systems, and business processes. One of the technologies that will help transform healthcare is artificial intelligence (AI). AI is based on human intelligence and can interact with other humans in different ways. AI can be applied in almost all the major areas in the healthcare industry. It’s particularly important for the service industry, for example, by understanding your business requirements and optimizing the outcomes.\nIn healthcare, there’s a lot of data analysis to be done to understand the needs of patients and providers. We can use these tools to understand the needs and to make predictions based on the information provided.\nAnother technology, for example, is the IBM Watson Health, which applies the science of AI to drive the decisions. The decision has to be made in real time to provide the information to healthcare providers. We can use AI to analyze the data to identify patterns. You can identify the patterns based on the information provided and make predictions.\nIBM provides the technology for a lot of healthcare solutions. We provide tools, analytics, and capabilities needed for healthcare providers to make better decisions. The next step is how we can extend these technologies to improve the patient experience.\nQ: How can the industry keep up with these changes?\nA: Healthcare providers and organizations need to take advantage of the new emerging technologies. Providers need to invest in the emerging technologies. They need to focus on their own digital transformations by improving the digital capabilities in the current transformation to take on the big players.\nThe industry should keep up by investing in different technologies to stay relevant and to provide innovative solutions to the healthcare industry. By investing in technology solutions, healthcare industry can improve the quality of services provided to patients and drive better outcomes.\nThe healthcare industry in the US is the largest employer of all occupations in the country. In fact, it employs almost 20% of the total employees in the country.\nWith healthcare industry being one of the fastest growing industries, it is important that a healthcare organization knows very well what factors are driving its success and failure.\nAnd, if it is taking advantage of new innovative technology solutions, it is a bonus."], "doc_hash": "45e3c16e2afcebba5bad6d617efcfd4260f74a2bcf0312b9bf9fa032f8dc294a", "prompt_hash": "3d0c1cf596181258a003e9f95c836c765d44353532e67c70d7dff48b05f64840", "target_hash": "e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855", "bypass": null}

Many of us know Bill as a dedicated member of the WMC and MCM community, working for an important part of the community. It is very important to understand the role of this person. Read on.\nThe purpose of this document is to share my observations, experiences and knowledge of our industry so that all participants may take advantage of the opportunities presented by our growing industry.\nMy name is Bill Zeban. I have been in the automotive industry for over 20 years. I have owned two dealerships, been a manufacturer district sales manager with Ford Motor Company and have spent the last 7 years as the CEO and President of the World Motorsport Council, a professional membership and certification division of SEMA. This organization was established to give an alternative for car dealers and other individuals involved in the automotive aftermarket to show their professionalism in business and technical competency. In the past, the aftermarket focused on the manufacturer’s certification, which was a good idea but it did not allow for the participation of independent shops. We are a non stock or member based association. Certification is not only good reputation marketing but also provides a base to expand our industry.\nThere are some misconceptions that seem to arise regularly about SEMA, the aftermarket and other related organizations and industries. I will share my insight and expertise on how the aftermarket functions in hopes of clarifying some of these issues.\nOver the last several years, SEMA has grown at a much faster pace than the rest of the aftermarket. The automotive aftermarket is a $20 billion industry. SEMA is a relatively small part of that but it provides many benefits to our segment. In 2007, over 75 percent of SEMA revenue came from auto parts and service. The remainder of revenue is derived from product development and licensing. Approximately 75 percent of manufacturers that are represented at SEMA use this organization for research to improve their products and services to dealers. We also provide dealer education services, and we work on legislation that benefits our members and the aftermarket as a whole.\nMany people are afraid that SEMA will only benefit large auto service operations, but the aftermarket in general represents smaller businesses than you may think. The average size of a SEMA dealer is two cars. This means that almost a million shops are represented in our member and certified member base. So the majority of people that you see at SEMA are not the big giants that you may anticipate and they are a huge portion of our society. Some are so small that they are not even listed in the Dealer Locator.\nAnother misconception is that most people that are involved in the SEMA show are members. In fact, most members do not visit or display at this show. Many members, especially the larger manufacturers, have found different means of reaching customers and dealers during the year with promotions and dealer meetings. However there is a significant portion that attend the show to see what is new, talk with competitors and suppliers and take advantage of the networking opportunities. Dealers and other independent shops that are members of SEMA find that this show is very effective for their businesses. By attending the show, they are able to reach more dealers and customers than they would have reached by taking a traditional trip to Las Vegas.\nMany of the manufacturers that sell to the aftermarket are at SEMA on a regular basis. This group is the majority of the members in SEMA and it includes several large manufacturers of automotive parts, tools, accessories and equipment. The manufacturers have the majority of their employees at SEMA because it is a highly productive time for them, providing opportunities to view our members’ cars, make purchases and learn about marketing services for their business. The manufacturers also use the show to meet with their independent sales managers, dealers and their own distributor network all under one roof. It is hard to explain the value of this event to an outsider.\nWe are not just an industry organization; we are an industry event. As I said before, the aftermarket is a $20 billion industry. Many of the major companies in this business find it difficult to attend a single show that reaches that amount in revenue. There are several multi day events that our industry attends in Las Vegas. Our members that are also manufacturers also set up trade exhibits that cover a much smaller area. In fact, most of their exhibits are just outside the entrance of the SEMA show and are just as effective as having them in the SEMA show floor. If a manufacturer cannot use one of their representatives to attend SEMA, they have the option to send a car and a banner that has their name on it. These display methods save them money and allow for the participation of many more people than they could hire for an entire show.\nSEMA also hosts many side events to entertain people who are not manufacturers and to keep them busy during these events. One of the most popular events is the annual SEMA Show Auto Corral, which features car shows on Friday evening and all day Saturday. On Friday night the Show Auto Corral features special shows open just to members of the automotive industry. Most of the members at this show are also members of SEMA. The show features special car shows for manufacturers, manufacturers specials for independent car care show and SEMA Show Cars. This is also a very popular event that does not have a cost to attend and the entry fees are low.\nOther events include the SEMA Cares Charity Classic held at the SEMA Show in Las Vegas in conjunction with a car auction. Since its inception in 2004, the Cares Charity Classic has raised an astounding over $8 million for charities.\nThe SEMA Show is very intense for us. We do our best to protect the interests of our members at our events by putting in place strict codes of conduct to regulate behavior at our events. We are very serious in this matter. SEMA has provided special training to our members and employees so that these issues are taken seriously.\nSEMA, like many other organizations, is comprised of many different personalities from a wide range of backgrounds and professions. As in any group, you will have some folks that will not represent your best interests. The best example of this is a small but vocal group of people that attempt to use the association to gain favor. SEMA does not and will always have a reputation of protecting the interests of its members. This is our primary responsibility to the aftermarket.\nWe must realize that if some people would stop playing games and were more concerned with the value of the organization we would find we had the support of a lot more people.\nThere are other organizations that represent the aftermarket with the same professional standards that SEMA does. The major automotive association (AMA) does not serve the after market as a whole and has more of an auto parts focus, not just automotive performance parts.\nSince 2003, I have worked with the AMA in an effort to become more involved. The AMA and I have had three meetings in the last year that I know of and they seem very concerned with their members. At our first meeting, our association was being reviewed by the AMA to see if we would be qualified to become a member. At the second meeting, there was still not a clear answer and the AMA made some changes to their code requirements for membership. To say that a code of ethics does not work or is not necessary is not the case with SEMA. We have to constantly be on guard to keep the right kind of people from joining our organization.\nSince my meeting with the AMA board, I have continued to see a lack of understanding of the difference between SEMA and the AMA and that SEMA provides a better quality membership and a level of service that the AMA cannot provide. There have been several recent instances where AMA members have approached us about membership issues. It is very discouraging for SEMA to see how some people are misrepresenting our association to members. It also makes you aware of those that don’t understand what a level of commitment it takes for our association to be successful.\nIt is easy for someone to tell you what is good about an organization in one sentence. After that, things go downhill. For that reason, I decided to go into detail about what we do and why we do it, so you may see how much work goes into our association.\nWe do not have the time or the resources to respond to questions for every company that has a problem or just needs to talk. We can only take care of the requests that are submitted to us through our website. We have received several calls and written letters from companies outside our organization. I have never seen a website or association that has as much information as ours, but there is no reason to have access to our member or dealer service data or to ask us questions. The most important reason is that we are a professional membership association and we take very seriously the responsibilities of preserving our reputation.\nI feel that you are not only the first point of contact for a company that has any issue with SEMA. You act as the main communicator with the company for that company and can answer a lot of the questions that are asked of us.

The code of ethics is only something that AMA members should be concerned with, and we are still waiting to see who the next group"]], "filtered_resps": ["I have received the following article from Bill Zeban, who has passed it to me to share with the rest of you. Many of us know Bill as a dedicated member of the WMC and MCM community, working for an important part of the community. It is very important to understand the role of this person. Read on.\nThe purpose of this document is to share my observations, experiences and knowledge of our industry so that all participants may take advantage of the opportunities presented by our growing industry.\nMy name is Bill Zeban. I have been in the automotive industry for over 20 years. I have owned two dealerships, been a manufacturer district sales manager with Ford Motor Company and have spent the last 7 years as the CEO and President of the World Motorsport Council, a professional membership and certification division of SEMA. This organization was established to give an alternative for car dealers and other individuals involved in the automotive aftermarket to show their professionalism in business and technical competency. In the past, the aftermarket focused on the manufacturer’s certification, which was a good idea but it did not allow for the participation of independent shops. We are a non stock or member based association. Certification is not only good reputation marketing but also provides a base to expand our industry.\nThere are some misconceptions that seem to arise regularly about SEMA, the aftermarket and other related organizations and industries. I will share my insight and expertise on how the aftermarket functions in hopes of clarifying some of these issues.\nOver the last several years, SEMA has grown at a much faster pace than the rest of the aftermarket. The automotive aftermarket is a $20 billion industry. SEMA is a relatively small part of that but it provides many benefits to our segment. In 2007, over 75 percent of SEMA revenue came from auto parts and service. The remainder of revenue is derived from product development and licensing. Approximately 75 percent of manufacturers that are represented at SEMA use this organization for research to improve their products and services to dealers. We also provide dealer education services, and we work on legislation that benefits our members and the aftermarket as a whole.\nMany people are afraid that SEMA will only benefit large auto service operations, but the aftermarket in general represents smaller businesses than you may think. The average size of a SEMA dealer is two cars. This means that almost a million shops are represented in our member and certified member base. So the majority of people that you see at SEMA are not the big giants that you may anticipate and they are a huge portion of our society. Some are so small that they are not even listed in the Dealer Locator.\nAnother misconception is that most people that are involved in the SEMA show are members. In fact, most members do not visit or display at this show. Many members, especially the larger manufacturers, have found different means of reaching customers and dealers during the year with promotions and dealer meetings. However there is a significant portion that attend the show to see what is new, talk with competitors and suppliers and take advantage of the networking opportunities. Dealers and other independent shops that are members of SEMA find that this show is very effective for their businesses. By attending the show, they are able to reach more dealers and customers than they would have reached by taking a traditional trip to Las Vegas.\nMany of the manufacturers that sell to the aftermarket are at SEMA on a regular basis. This group is the majority of the members in SEMA and it includes several large manufacturers of automotive parts, tools, accessories and equipment. The manufacturers have the majority of their employees at SEMA because it is a highly productive time for them, providing opportunities to view our members’ cars, make purchases and learn about marketing services for their business. The manufacturers also use the show to meet with their independent sales managers, dealers and their own distributor network all under one roof. It is hard to explain the value of this event to an outsider.\nWe are not just an industry organization; we are an industry event. As I said before, the aftermarket is a $20 billion industry. Many of the major companies in this business find it difficult to attend a single show that reaches that amount in revenue. There are several multi day events that our industry attends in Las Vegas. Our members that are also manufacturers also set up trade exhibits that cover a much smaller area. In fact, most of their exhibits are just outside the entrance of the SEMA show and are just as effective as having them in the SEMA show floor. If a manufacturer cannot use one of their representatives to attend SEMA, they have the option to send a car and a banner that has their name on it. These display methods save them money and allow for the participation of many more people than they could hire for an entire show.\nSEMA also hosts many side events to entertain people who are not manufacturers and to keep them busy during these events. One of the most popular events is the annual SEMA Show Auto Corral, which features car shows on Friday evening and all day Saturday. On Friday night the Show Auto Corral features special shows open just to members of the automotive industry. Most of the members at this show are also members of SEMA. The show features special car shows for manufacturers, manufacturers specials for independent car care show and SEMA Show Cars. This is also a very popular event that does not have a cost to attend and the entry fees are low.\nOther events include the SEMA Cares Charity Classic held at the SEMA Show in Las Vegas in conjunction with a car auction. Since its inception in 2004, the Cares Charity Classic has raised an astounding over $8 million for charities.\nThe SEMA Show is very intense for us. We do our best to protect the interests of our members at our events by putting in place strict codes of conduct to regulate behavior at our events. We are very serious in this matter. SEMA has provided special training to our members and employees so that these issues are taken seriously.\nSEMA, like many other organizations, is comprised of many different personalities from a wide range of backgrounds and professions. As in any group, you will have some folks that will not represent your best interests. The best example of this is a small but vocal group of people that attempt to use the association to gain favor. SEMA does not and will always have a reputation of protecting the interests of its members. This is our primary responsibility to the aftermarket.\nWe must realize that if some people would stop playing games and were more concerned with the value of the organization we would find we had the support of a lot more people.\nThere are other organizations that represent the aftermarket with the same professional standards that SEMA does. The major automotive association (AMA) does not serve the after market as a whole and has more of an auto parts focus, not just automotive performance parts.\nSince 2003, I have worked with the AMA in an effort to become more involved. The AMA and I have had three meetings in the last year that I know of and they seem very concerned with their members. At our first meeting, our association was being reviewed by the AMA to see if we would be qualified to become a member. At the second meeting, there was still not a clear answer and the AMA made some changes to their code requirements for membership. To say that a code of ethics does not work or is not necessary is not the case with SEMA. We have to constantly be on guard to keep the right kind of people from joining our organization.\nSince my meeting with the AMA board, I have continued to see a lack of understanding of the difference between SEMA and the AMA and that SEMA provides a better quality membership and a level of service that the AMA cannot provide. There have been several recent instances where AMA members have approached us about membership issues. It is very discouraging for SEMA to see how some people are misrepresenting our association to members. It also makes you aware of those that don’t understand what a level of commitment it takes for our association to be successful.\nIt is easy for someone to tell you what is good about an organization in one sentence. After that, things go downhill. For that reason, I decided to go into detail about what we do and why we do it, so you may see how much work goes into our association.\nWe do not have the time or the resources to respond to questions for every company that has a problem or just needs to talk. We can only take care of the requests that are submitted to us through our website. We have received several calls and written letters from companies outside our organization. I have never seen a website or association that has as much information as ours, but there is no reason to have access to our member or dealer service data or to ask us questions. The most important reason is that we are a professional membership association and we take very seriously the responsibilities of preserving our reputation.\nI feel that you are not only the first point of contact for a company that has any issue with SEMA. You act as the main communicator with the company for that company and can answer a lot of the questions that are asked of us. As the first point of contact, you seem to see our organization through a different lens. All it takes is a few positive or negative responses to start making a name for your service or your company. I know this because I have seen it happen on several occasions and that also happens all the time on the Internet and when I go on the SEMA website!\nOur website is always being upgraded and we have added a members’ area where everyone can update or add to their existing content.

I have a lot of the Staedtler Pinsol pens but have not taken the time to try them out. Have you ever tried the Sakura Gell Rolls? I have no problems with the Pentel Slicci if you drop it, they are amazing with watercolor as well.\nNo, don’t have those. But now I want them!\nLove this! Especially the way you’ve positioned the images, the colors and the font, all of it.\nThanks for the inspiration; I’m actually working on a photo illustration right now. I can’t seem to get anything good done, so I just keep trying different photos until I do!\nI wish you well with your project and I wish I were inspired to do one too – this piece took about 30 hours or so and I’m not normally that slow!\nwow, incredible. i love it.\nThanks 🙂 It was so much fun and took no time to do."], "doc_hash": "45e3c16e2afcebba5bad6d617efcfd4260f74a2bcf0312b9bf9fa032f8dc294a", "prompt_hash": "3d0c1cf596181258a003e9f95c836c765d44353532e67c70d7dff48b05f64840", "target_hash": "e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855", "bypass": null}

However, there are numerous soft skills that can be learned as well. To better your chances of securing the position of your choice, you should acquire these skills.\nThese skills are important for a job seeker’s success. These skills not only help you stand out from the crowd. Even if you are seeking a job where your work experience is all that is required, soft skills can prove to be just as important as technical skills.\nIf you’re not sure how to improve your soft skills, you may need to get some outside help. Our team at Cielo has the expertise and experience to assist you in improving your soft skills and, as a result, your chances of landing that perfect job.\nHard Skills – Hard skills refer to any skills relevant to the job you are applying for, ranging from programming languages to accounting principles. Since it is easier to teach individuals hard skills, they are more useful than soft skills.\nSoft Skills – These are attributes that are more difficult to teach. They refer to how you conduct yourself in your daily interpersonal interactions in a variety of settings. These skills are difficult to quantify and evaluate, but having them will set you apart as an employee. Soft skills are extremely beneficial to job applicants since they help to improve the candidate’s ability to interact positively with employees and management, and are valued by corporate leaders in a wide range of industries, both in the United States and abroad.\nInterpersonal Skills: These skills can be acquired through training and are useful in any workplace. They are essential for teamwork, as they help to establish trust in one’s ability to interact with coworkers and clients. The most difficult skills to learn are communication skills, such as active listening skills, or how to interact with other team members in an interpersonal or group setting. In fact, active listening skill is very difficult. You must be able to hear other people and truly understand what they have to say in order to truly listen effectively.\nA critical component of interpersonal skills is the ability to communicate clearly. It is difficult to have a conversation with other people without communicating effectively. The ability to effectively resolve conflicts is essential for any job position or organization. It can be difficult to stay calm and avoid getting agitated in the most difficult situations, but it is necessary. Having good communication skills can help you resolve conflicts in a manner that is both productive and efficient.\nOther interpersonal skills that can be developed include the ability to motivate others, to effectively delegate tasks, and to work well as part of a team or leader. Motivation is a characteristic that sets you apart. It will determine the outcome of any project that you are assigned. Because motivation is so easy to acquire, it is often ignored by students and employees. It is important to understand that motivation can be learned, but it should be nurtured in order to achieve the highest possible results.\nDelegation skills are another critical skill. Delegation is the act of assigning tasks to someone else in order to free up your time for more important activities. One of the most common mistakes that are made in the workplace is that one employee will assign too many tasks or assignments but won’t follow through on what has been assigned. If one person becomes too involved in the assignment, it can make the whole team sluggish and unproductive. Other employees may not even understand what has been assigned to them, so there is no point in trying to implement new ideas. It is easy for one person or group to take over another’s workload, and it can cause resentment and a decreased level of trust between workers.\nTeamwork skills can come into play when a project requires more than one person. Because each individual has their own strengths and weaknesses, it is important to assign tasks based on what the team needs to accomplish. This is why it is important to train yourself and your employees how to work together as a team. When a team is organized and operates smoothly, productivity is increased and there are fewer employee turnovers. This means a better workplace for everyone.\nThe importance of customer service skills cannot be overestimated. A good customer service team is instrumental in the success of any business. In fact, it is necessary for the success of any organization in any service or business. Having good customer service skills can help you to effectively deal with customers, keep the customer happy and make sure that the product or service provided meets customer expectations.\nA customer service employee must be able to identify problems, make suggestions, and resolve issues quickly. This is done by asking the customer about his or her needs and expectations, then making suggestions and using resources to make sure that the product or service is delivered on time. Customer service representatives can do a large amount of research on their own, so they are highly valued. In addition, customer service representatives often receive recognition and promotions.\nAs you can see, soft skills are just as important as technical skills when it comes to finding and keeping a job.

However, there are numerous soft skills that can be learned as well. To better your chances of securing the position of your choice, you should acquire these skills.\nThese skills are important for a job seeker’s success. These skills not only help you stand out from the crowd. Even if you are seeking a job where your work experience is all that is required, soft skills can prove to be just as important as technical skills.\nIf you’re not sure how to improve your soft skills, you may need to get some outside help. Our team at Cielo has the expertise and experience to assist you in improving your soft skills and, as a result, your chances of landing that perfect job.\nHard Skills – Hard skills refer to any skills relevant to the job you are applying for, ranging from programming languages to accounting principles. Since it is easier to teach individuals hard skills, they are more useful than soft skills.\nSoft Skills – These are attributes that are more difficult to teach. They refer to how you conduct yourself in your daily interpersonal interactions in a variety of settings. These skills are difficult to quantify and evaluate, but having them will set you apart as an employee. Soft skills are extremely beneficial to job applicants since they help to improve the candidate’s ability to interact positively with employees and management, and are valued by corporate leaders in a wide range of industries, both in the United States and abroad.\nInterpersonal Skills: These skills can be acquired through training and are useful in any workplace. They are essential for teamwork, as they help to establish trust in one’s ability to interact with coworkers and clients. The most difficult skills to learn are communication skills, such as active listening skills, or how to interact with other team members in an interpersonal or group setting. In fact, active listening skill is very difficult. You must be able to hear other people and truly understand what they have to say in order to truly listen effectively.\nA critical component of interpersonal skills is the ability to communicate clearly. It is difficult to have a conversation with other people without communicating effectively. The ability to effectively resolve conflicts is essential for any job position or organization. It can be difficult to stay calm and avoid getting agitated in the most difficult situations, but it is necessary. Having good communication skills can help you resolve conflicts in a manner that is both productive and efficient.\nOther interpersonal skills that can be developed include the ability to motivate others, to effectively delegate tasks, and to work well as part of a team or leader. Motivation is a characteristic that sets you apart. It will determine the outcome of any project that you are assigned. Because motivation is so easy to acquire, it is often ignored by students and employees. It is important to understand that motivation can be learned, but it should be nurtured in order to achieve the highest possible results.\nDelegation skills are another critical skill. Delegation is the act of assigning tasks to someone else in order to free up your time for more important activities. One of the most common mistakes that are made in the workplace is that one employee will assign too many tasks or assignments but won’t follow through on what has been assigned. If one person becomes too involved in the assignment, it can make the whole team sluggish and unproductive. Other employees may not even understand what has been assigned to them, so there is no point in trying to implement new ideas. It is easy for one person or group to take over another’s workload, and it can cause resentment and a decreased level of trust between workers.\nTeamwork skills can come into play when a project requires more than one person. Because each individual has their own strengths and weaknesses, it is important to assign tasks based on what the team needs to accomplish. This is why it is important to train yourself and your employees how to work together as a team. When a team is organized and operates smoothly, productivity is increased and there are fewer employee turnovers. This means a better workplace for everyone.\nThe importance of customer service skills cannot be overestimated. A good customer service team is instrumental in the success of any business. In fact, it is necessary for the success of any organization in any service or business. Having good customer service skills can help you to effectively deal with customers, keep the customer happy and make sure that the product or service provided meets customer expectations.\nA customer service employee must be able to identify problems, make suggestions, and resolve issues quickly. This is done by asking the customer about his or her needs and expectations, then making suggestions and using resources to make sure that the product or service is delivered on time. Customer service representatives can do a large amount of research on their own, so they are highly valued. In addition, customer service representatives often receive recognition and promotions.\nAs you can see, soft skills are just as important as technical skills when it comes to finding and keeping a job. You will not only stand out from the crowd by showing off your communication skills, but you will impress other employees and leaders.\nIf you’re unsure about how to improve your soft skills and strengthen them, you’re in luck!

The proposal, announced by Europe’s Finance Ministers, has sparked a wave of reactions from industry stakeholders and policymakers alike, who’ve questioned the proposed move, its implications and the overall effect the regulatory scheme could have on crypto and Web3 ecosystems.\nThe proposed rules could have dramatic consequences for the crypto industry in Europe, making compliance to regulations a necessity to operate within the continent, requiring crypto services companies to adopt Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) protocols such as those introduced by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) recommendations, to comply with local laws.\nCrypto businesses must be able to maintain KYC and AML records and, due to their nature, they are often seen as inherently risky for money laundering, which can lead to the disruption of the entire business, and therefore, the overall development of the European crypto space.\nAlthough European authorities aren’t particularly welcoming to crypto, crypto-friendly nations like Malta and Switzerland are taking the lead in this industry, introducing laws to support the crypto community and boost digital assets’ adoption, while the UK appears to be lagging behind.\nAmidst growing regulatory pressure, European crypto businesses may look towards offshore jurisdictions that are less stringent when it comes to cryptocurrency regulation. For startups specifically, being able to operate freely or with very loose restrictions is what they value most, which is why jurisdictions such as Malta, Costa Rica, Singapore, Malta, Panama, and Switzerland attract a huge number of crypto projects every year.\nWhat exactly is the FATF, and, most importantly, who is impacted by this new regulatory framework?\nFATF, short for Financial Action Task Force, is a global regulatory body that sets standards to combat money laundering and other financial crimes.\nIn the crypto industry, the FATF has two main guidelines, one set of standards aimed at traditional financial institutions, and another, the Travel Rule standard, which regulates how crypto companies must comply with its guidelines or face heavy fine penalties.\nIn an effort to combat money laundering, FATF requires traditional financial institutions and crypto companies to maintain KYC, identify their users, and report suspicious transactions which could be related to money laundering or other fraudulent activities.\nHowever, FATF also requires traditional financial institutions to adhere to “travel” rules, which specify that “services providers must identify and share information about the payer of money and the beneficiary of money or virtual currency” when a transactional service like a wire transfer or a credit card payment occurs.\nThe implication of the FATF travel rule standard was that crypto was, for the first time, recognized as a means of payments, and as a result, as a target for AML/CTF purposes. As such, crypto-to-crypto transactions, and transfers from digital wallets, were now a target for AML/CTF verification, despite the fact that crypto is often used by people in countries with high numbers of unregulated or illegal financial activities, which have high risk levels for money laundering.\nRegulators in different jurisdictions may interpret the FATF standards in different ways, putting their national policies in conflict with international regulations, which is exactly what happened at the time with the EU, who tried to implement the FATF standards while they were still in progress and lacking any concrete definition.\nIn 2020, despite the continued lack of clarity regarding how to apply the FATF standards on crypto transactions, the EU took a step forward and adopted a proposal for a “market standard” that set a minimum level for AML/CTF regulation, in anticipation of more clarity from FATF.\nThe draft law, although aimed at all banks and financial institutions, can be interpreted by regulators as an attempt to apply regulations on crypto operators in the EU. The draft law would prohibit all digital asset service firms from accessing the European financial sector and operate within the EU without a license or a “PassPorting” mechanism. PassPorting is a regulatory mechanism that allows European authorized institutions the ability to provide services in another EU country. It is commonly used by financial institutions in the crypto space as a way to bypass regulations in other jurisdictions.\nHowever, the fact that crypto businesses are not currently required to follow AML/CTF policies already in place in many jurisdictions puts crypto at a disadvantage when compared to traditional financial institutions operating in the same jurisdiction. Therefore regulators may view the crypto sector too risky for AML/CTF compliance if they are operating independently.\nThe EU proposal has been met with significant backlash by the crypto industry.\nAmong the main criticisms of the proposal is that the EU’s current draft law lacks clarity.\nThe vagueness of the proposal makes it difficult for crypto businesses to gauge what policies they must follow, and whether they can benefit from the same regulatory systems used by traditional financial institutions.\nThe lack of clarity also makes it difficult for EU authorities to understand what cryptocurrency businesses can offer, and, therefore, how their financial assets can be properly regulated, which is also why crypto companies are now looking elsewhere for opportunities in less onerous jurisdictions.\nIf the current proposal is approved by the European Parliament, which has yet to be approved, crypto companies operating in the EU face heavy obstacles and potential disruption of their businesses.\nFor crypto businesses operating in the EU, complying with AML/CTF policies and the European market standards is mandatory if they want to stay operational in the EU, or access EU financial markets for both fiat and crypto services.\nThere are numerous crypto service providers operating in Germany, but there are other countries with more lenient crypto regulations, such as Austria, Malta, Switzerland, and even Singapore whose stringent compliance policies will attract more crypto companies in the future.\nIt’s clear that the crypto industry needs to be regulated, but how the regulations are applied, and the actual implications could mean the difference between a thriving business and the complete cessation of operations."]], "filtered_resps": ["In December, the European Commission announced its plans to propose new legislation that would regulate crypto-assets under the same terms as conventional financial services and products.

I'll ask myself if it isn't better to tell a thing once or twice so I can get it done, instead of using a device, or even better, putting it as dialogue - for which the character would say it.

They don't tend to use many devices to show events, but instead use the simple, matter-of-fact way they tell things. For instance, one I really like, Steven Erikson, will just go ahead and describe something, without putting any filter in front of it. In contrast, say, I might be hesitant to say something like: \"Djall took his axe out of the hole he had burned in the floor, and threw it into the flames.\" I realize the person knows what just happened, but I wonder - can I express the information I want to convey, in another way that isn't so telling?\n\nAgain, here I want to address the caveats I mentioned earlier. In this post, I do realize that sometimes the rules against doing certain things are there for good reason. That sometimes, even though two people might know the same thing, one person might choose to tell it to another, and for good reason. And yes, sometimes, one might even choose to tell someone they are telling them something, rather than to show them.\n\nMaybe, in contrast to what I often read, for good reason, people do choose telling over showing or another device in order to move things along. I'm not saying they don't have a reason. It's just, I wonder if they are doing it too often, or too strongly.\n\nI know telling has both its bad points, and when you know it can be bad, it is often a good idea either to avoid telling, or do it sparingly. But that is all. In this post, I just want to have discussion. Do any of you think, or know, what makes telling bad?

Do you think there are some cases where telling is good in certain situations and not so good in other situations?"]], "filtered_resps": ["You all know the basic rule of thumb for writing fiction - \"show, don't tell.\"\n\nWell, that's a lot of what writing advice is, I think - telling you to show, or not to tell.

In contrast, say, I might be hesitant to say something like: \"Djall took his axe out of the hole he had burned in the floor, and threw it into the flames.\" I realize the person knows what just happened, but I wonder - can I express the information I want to convey, in another way that isn't so telling?\n\nAgain, here I want to address the caveats I mentioned earlier. In this post, I do realize that sometimes the rules against doing certain things are there for good reason. That sometimes, even though two people might know the same thing, one person might choose to tell it to another, and for good reason. And yes, sometimes, one might even choose to tell someone they are telling them something, rather than to show them.\n\nMaybe, in contrast to what I often read, for good reason, people do choose telling over showing or another device in order to move things along. I'm not saying they don't have a reason. It's just, I wonder if they are doing it too often, or too strongly.\n\nI know telling has both its bad points, and when you know it can be bad, it is often a good idea either to avoid telling, or do it sparingly. But that is all. In this post, I just want to have discussion. Do any of you think, or know, what makes telling bad? Do you think there are situations where telling is bad, but writing devices are good in other situations? Do you think there are some cases where telling is good in certain situations and not so good in other situations?"], "doc_hash": "45e3c16e2afcebba5bad6d617efcfd4260f74a2bcf0312b9bf9fa032f8dc294a", "prompt_hash": "3d0c1cf596181258a003e9f95c836c765d44353532e67c70d7dff48b05f64840", "target_hash": "e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855", "bypass": null}

At the same time, the company is also expanding its range to include new plug-in hybrid models.\nTwo years ago, Porsche and Volkswagen Group subsidiary Cupra announced a partnership to develop plug-in hybrid versions of upcoming models from the Porsche sports car manufacturer. Now Cupra has announced the brand’s first all-electric model from the middle of next year: an SUV called Formentor.\nThe Cupra model is positioned as an alternative to the Tesla Model Y and will be built in a newly built factory in Martorell, Spain for Cupra and the Volkswagen Group. Cupra will also offer performance vehicles based on the Porsche Panamera and Taycan in future.\nBut it is the Porsche segment that is also likely to be one of the most promising and fastest growing parts of the business in future. With the 918 Spyder and Taycan, the sports car manufacturer has already implemented a very successful start to electric propulsion to date.\nThe electrification of the range is now being continued: after the Taycan – which is available with various output levels – the company wants to follow the Panamera and Macan with plug-in hybrid models at the end of 2020. The Cayenne and 992 generation Turbo should of course also receive a plug-in hybrid version.\nThe Porsche Panamera and Cayenne plug-in hybrid models are said to offer a range of electric driving of more than 100 kilometres. The top-of-the-range Panamera Turbo S E-Hybrid will be equipped with a petrol engine from the V8 family, as well as a large high-capacity battery.\nThese should enable a driving range of 600 kilometers, and the maximum output of 600 hp should be a bit above the Panamera 4 in terms of performance. These are the figures that you are currently not used to with Porsche models.\nAlso interesting: how dangerous is the Chinese CoroVirus for us?\nWhile the Panamera has lost some of its sporting flair, the new Cayenne will appear as a more athletic model with significantly tighter proportions. The all-electric e-Taycan has been on the US market since summer 2020.\nR&D: how dangerous is the Chinese CoroVirus for us?\nThe Taycan’s range is just under 480 km, which is around twice as long as the Tesla Model S’s range and more than 40 percent longer than the next model in the premium electric segment, the Audi E-Tron. It also has the advantage of quick refueling times: according to the WLTP certification criteria, the Taycan takes around half an hour for a recharge to 80 percent. The E-Tron, with a 90 kWh battery, reaches the same level after an hour.\nPorsche expects to launch more than 100 electrified models by 2025, while by 2030 its annual sales of electrified and battery-powered vehicles should reach one billion. But the company also wants to remain flexible – the 911, for example, can still be purchased with a gasoline engine.\nThe sports car manufacturer does not want to be a player in the electric car market in the coming years. That is why Porsche wants to be more flexible by combining electric propulsion with combustion engine technology. The future model for everyday use thus becomes a hybrid.\nWhile the Porsche Cayenne has been the model for electric drive for a long time, the 911 and Macan have to wait a little longer. When production of the mid-engined sports car, which was recently named the world’s most beautiful sports car for the ninth time, will finally move from Zuffenhausen to Leipzig, Porsche is said to have decided on an additional plug-in hybrid variant.\nThis top-of-the-line variant would be the first electrified variant of the 911 as well, which is why the future model range would also receive a plug-in hybrid variant for the first time. For the first time at the beginning of the next decade, Porsche is therefore considering a vehicle that combines an electric propulsion system with a combustion engine.\nEven though the 911 is not exactly a newcomer to the scene, the car manufacturer must continue with the model. The 911 as the sporty flagship of the brand also represents Porsche’s commitment to its own technology platform. There is also the intention of expanding the range by plug-in hybrids, which are also to be deployed under the label 992.\nThe first information about the Cayman models for the next generation have already been announced: The front is said to be more upright than today and therefore also sportier, while the rear could benefit from a less aggressive character line.\nAt the same time, the next-generation 718 Boxster is already in the starting blocks. This model will also receive an electrically assisted mid-engine hybrid system, with a drive concept based on the Taycan and the Panamera Sports Turismo. These will be the first two plug-in hybrid sports cars of this type from Porsche. The mid-range sports car, for example, comes on the market from 2020 under the names 718 and 728.\nIn both models, the new 48-volt starter-generator should increase the maximum torque by 20 percent and increase the fuel efficiency by 15 percent. The electric sports car e-Boxter concept, presented at the 2013 Geneva Motor Show on a concept of the Cayman S, is also still at the stage of planning. One of the biggest challenges for the electric sports car is an impressive range. As the Taycan shows, a real 300 km range is no problem. With the Taycan, Porsche has succeeded in equipping the first sporty electric car with a range large enough to take over the daily trip without problems.\nWhat was missing in the electric car world at first was a second model that could actually come close to Porsche brand quality. But now two vehicles are coming from Porsche. It is still early to say how successful the products will be, but it is evident that Porsche is on the cutting edge of technology in the car market and intends to take a big step forward with the Taycan.\nThe company would not have introduced the Taycan if it hadn’t been a top-class product with all the technical details – such as charging, for example. Of course, the company is also not losing its independence in product development. Now Porsche has become a competitor in the pure electric car market and must deliver comparable ranges in the range of 250 or 350 km.\nAnd it should be said that it can do it well, as the Taycan proves. In terms of performance and the technical capabilities that go with it, the first Porsche is already a successful model."]], "filtered_resps": ["Riding on a wave of growth in recent years, Porsche is preparing a new electric sports car.\nThis would be the successor to the Porsche 918 Spyder hybrid prototype, which launched a highly prestigious and successful model series.

The 911 as the sporty flagship of the brand also represents Porsche’s commitment to its own technology platform. There is also the intention of expanding the range by plug-in hybrids, which are also to be deployed under the label 992.\nThe first information about the Cayman models for the next generation have already been announced: The front is said to be more upright than today and therefore also sportier, while the rear could benefit from a less aggressive character line.\nAt the same time, the next-generation 718 Boxster is already in the starting blocks. This model will also receive an electrically assisted mid-engine hybrid system, with a drive concept based on the Taycan and the Panamera Sports Turismo. These will be the first two plug-in hybrid sports cars of this type from Porsche. The mid-range sports car, for example, comes on the market from 2020 under the names 718 and 728.\nIn both models, the new 48-volt starter-generator should increase the maximum torque by 20 percent and increase the fuel efficiency by 15 percent. The electric sports car e-Boxter concept, presented at the 2013 Geneva Motor Show on a concept of the Cayman S, is also still at the stage of planning. One of the biggest challenges for the electric sports car is an impressive range. As the Taycan shows, a real 300 km range is no problem. With the Taycan, Porsche has succeeded in equipping the first sporty electric car with a range large enough to take over the daily trip without problems.\nWhat was missing in the electric car world at first was a second model that could actually come close to Porsche brand quality. But now two vehicles are coming from Porsche. It is still early to say how successful the products will be, but it is evident that Porsche is on the cutting edge of technology in the car market and intends to take a big step forward with the Taycan.\nThe company would not have introduced the Taycan if it hadn’t been a top-class product with all the technical details – such as charging, for example. Of course, the company is also not losing its independence in product development. Now Porsche has become a competitor in the pure electric car market and must deliver comparable ranges in the range of 250 or 350 km.\nAnd it should be said that it can do it well, as the Taycan proves. In terms of performance and the technical capabilities that go with it, the first Porsche is already a successful model."], "doc_hash": "45e3c16e2afcebba5bad6d617efcfd4260f74a2bcf0312b9bf9fa032f8dc294a", "prompt_hash": "3d0c1cf596181258a003e9f95c836c765d44353532e67c70d7dff48b05f64840", "target_hash": "e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855", "bypass": null}

They didn't really care about truth in the least; they were driven by a passion to persecute and even kill Him.\nThen we move to those who didn't have an immediate problem with Him. They appreciated Him for what He was – and so they made the effort to come and actually listen to Him. At first, that was all they did – listen – before they dismissed Him. But they were willing to make the effort, and so they went on to do more.\nThat's where we are at this point in Mark. \"But He moved on through more cities and villages... until He reached his destination.\" If you recall, Jesus went to Jerusalem to start His public ministry where He went about carrying out the mission God had given His Son. When He got to Jordan, He was baptized by John who prepared Him to minister. Now He has gone throughout Galilee – He hasn't even spent a lot of time in Jerusalem – and they're continuing to listen... but they're continuing to be confused by just what they're hearing.\nI am convinced that Jesus didn't have any problem talking with those who were simply curious. His problem was with those who did not want to hear; who had a different agenda; who were driven by an agenda to see Christ crucified again – as they viewed it.\nI do not know how many will see this sermon series as relevant today since we are in the midst of the coronavirus and social distancing. I have no idea how this disease will turn out or how much worse it might become. But one thing I do know and that is if the current problem continues we need to find different ways to connect.\nI believe and have always believed that churches need to find ways to connect with people in a virtual way. For us that means having online services on Sunday morning and having them available on video later in the day so people can view them if they want. But there should be other ways to maintain that connection and I think we'll find out as the days continue.\nIn the meantime, for me it is not as important what we're going through now as it is where do churches go from here – what can they still have on Sunday morning that people can view online to get connected.\nAs I look at it today, the important part for us as churches is how will we meet people's needs online rather than in person? It could be about something as simple as putting video on the website or making a video available in social media for people to watch later, or, if a church is equipped to do livestreaming, we can put them up there on a regular basis and hopefully people will feel more connected as a result.\nNow in the midst of all of that, we are continuing our series based on Mark's gospel. So far Mark's gospel is a series of events; and in this series it has been in a somewhat reverse chronological order. Now he goes back to what he considered the key point of Jesus's ministry and that would be the beginning.\nLast week, Mark finished the account of Jesus being questioned by some Jews in Jerusalem because He had healed some on the Sabbath. Although we know that Jesus did a fair amount of His healing ministry on the Sabbath so as to get this message out, this incident is unique. Mark has never given any account of what happened, and he goes into a fair amount of detail of Jesus' response. In the process he makes some very important points.\nIn that incident Jesus does something that the religious leaders found extremely offensive. He was healing on the Sabbath. He healed the man with the ear. He healed him through healing the man with the sick. He was taking this most basic physical need of all and, not only taking care of it but restoring it, or even perhaps restoring him to his normal self. That's what He showed the man he needed – that his ear was healed enough to be attached once again. That's what He was doing.\nAnd so Mark tells that He healed him and he had so much compassion on him that He healed him so that he could be a witness to what God wants people to be – restored and re-connected. And he was also a witness at the same time to why this needed to be changed and that was to provide testimony to what God has done. And so Mark is telling us that Jesus did this to provide testimony about what Jesus did so they would remember in the days to come what He did about His ministry on the Sabbath.\nNow that's kind of where we are going to pick up today. In the account of that healing last week, Mark told us some of what He said – but now we're going to go deeper into what He said to them.\nI believe that in this scene what He said to them was one of the most significant things that He ever said and was one of the most significant things that He ever taught anyone. Although it has been written down by His disciples and the disciples that gathered around Him, the world at large, with the exception of a very few followers, has forgotten His teachings and He was saying such profound things that people would find difficult to understand it in a short period of time. They would have to learn and spend time together for people to get the understanding, but He still continued to teach them.\nSo in this scene we get a little insight into the mindset of the Jews at this time, which is a mindset that has never been completely removed. Jesus's response to what He said in Mark 3:4, you remember, was for them to be offended. And if He could only get them to understand it and not be offended, then they would be saved and they would understand and they would see the truth and the way things ought to be.\n\"The disciples said to Him, 'Teacher, we know that you are true and care for no one. You have no respect for the high official because you care for no one. \nIn other words, the Jewish leadership has a perception of who Jesus is. Jesus isn't just a Galilean; He's from Nazareth – Nazareth of Galilee. They say He's the product of the low end of Israel. They are very sure that Jesus is a person who is the ultimate hypocrite. The fact is the Jews knew that if they did anything on the Sabbath they could be prosecuted. That was the law. So, Jesus is a hypocrite because He is being a hypocrite; He's breaking the law, and He's doing it on the Sabbath.\nThen there is the fact that His disciples are plucking heads of grain. The fact is He is breaking the law by not letting them gather grains to satisfy their physical need. Now that is not the full story of the law of the Sabbath. For instance, the command to work on the Sabbath is for one's physical needs, and God has given us what's necessary for our needs and He has permitted it. And that's just one aspect of why they were breaking the law.\nBut that is a law that they are very sure that Christ is in violation of. The fact that Christ allowed His disciple to pluck grain and eat it shows, again, that He is in violation of the law.\nBut that's not all about the Sabbath – that's just a portion of what He said about what the Sabbath is for. He is making a much more profound point. First of all, Jesus says, \"In what way is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or bad?\" Jesus is asking because it seemed to be that the way He was doing these works was not done with their authority so that He would make a clear point about what He's teaching.\nThis is just a short bit of an explanation about how the Sabbath is for us to do good for others and not for Christ to be violating the law – for us to be obeying it. And as it turned out, He had just performed an amazing action with His disciples. First of all, if people broke the Sabbath law and were seen by others, they would be stoned without question. In the midst of breaking the Sabbath law, He allowed His disciples to pluck grain. He has just done an amazing thing. In fact, they say He is making a mockery of the Sabbath because He permits them to pluck the heads of grain, which is breaking the law.\nNow the question is: What law did they break? The answer is the law on the Sabbath concerning work. They were permitted to gather grain. But they were supposed to make sure they gathered enough grain for their physical needs for the Sabbath and they were not, from the context, plucking the heads of grain and collecting them for their physical needs – unless they were plucking that grain to be eaten.\nThe Pharisees had a good legal case that Jesus was breaking the law because, in the culture, it was very difficult at certain times to get through the day and do anything physical at all if you didn't have some food for a meal. So they said that they were only plucking the head of grain. They said that they were not going to pluck the grain until the end of the Sabbath. However, He said He would not be the judge on whether that interpretation was right, or whether it was wrong. And He said, \"Is it lawful to do good on the Sabbath?\"\nIn verse 18 when He quotes from Isaiah, He is quoting from the \"Prophets\" not from the Old Testament but from Isaiah. When he mentions the Prophets, in the original text it said \"the prophets.\" The text uses \"the prophets\" as a collective noun.\nIn the original text it uses a plural noun, \"the Law.\" The text"]], "filtered_resps": ["At first it seemed to me that we would not get any further than those who first heard Him – some of whom gave Him no more than a casual passing attention before they turned sharply away in disgust.

List some interesting facts about yourself.\n4. Share a photo of a book or bookish thing.\nA: A friend nominated me and I haven’t gotten to the part yet but I’m very excited to be doing this award. This is really cool. So far I’m liking it.\nA: Oh wow, I think all of them. I feel like the books I hate are either so horrible it’s hard for me to finish them or not for me because my brain cannot seem to understand it. I think the only thing I actually threw out to the wall was a book called “It” because it was too scary for me. Everything else usually gets finished.\nA: I definitely read less adult books then YA ones and I have found myself drifting to fantasy for the last year or so.\nA: I don’t really have a reading goal but I just try to get read what I need to get done and that’s what matters.\nA: Hells no because I can’t read physical books. I think if I tried reading them I would break my eyesight. Although that makes me want to try reading physical books.\n4. What was your greatest moment as a reader?\nA: I think the most moment for my reading was when I tried reading adult books and I ended up loving it. I feel like I found the best genre for my tastes.\nA: I have always been inspired by so many books and authors so I’ve said this before but I think the most one who has inspired me the most is probably Tamora Pierce. She’s a legend and I love her writing and as a author. She’s made me want to try my hand at writing more fantasy.\n6. What was your greatest disappointment?\nA: The last one that comes to mind was a book that I gave 2 stars to and I was surprised when I was reviewing it. I wasn’t really impressed because I had already read the first few book and wasn’t as into it. So yeah, that’s been a downer but I’m glad I read it because it helped me decide maybe not to continue.\n7. What book would you recommend to anyone?\nA: Mostly YA books. It’s where I’m at right now.\n8. What is your worst habit?\nA: I’m sure this happens to most bloggers but I’m quite lazy when it comes to reviewing. So yeah, that’s a habit I can change.\n9. What’s your favorite blog post?\nA: I think it’s these questions I did. I really enjoyed answering them. I like being creative with these posts and I hope I do more questions.\n10. What is something you can’t stop watching?\nA: I watch You tube videos all the time. I watch anything on there. I even watch things on there that I never even heard about. I don’t have an addictive thing for YouTube right now but I could watch it all day if I just let it.\n11. Do you have a favourite post from your blog?\nA: I think it’s one from the top questions I asked myself and it was the one about books that made me cry. I felt it was a great topic.\n3. What is your favorite series?\n5. Who is your favorite book boyfriend?\n6. Do you write a blog?\n7. What book are you most excited to read?\n8. What do you do when you have downtime or bored?\n9.

'Nocturne' is influenced by the 70's progressive rock bands of that era, particularly the work from German outfit Ash Ra Tempel, plus also taking its cue from the psychedelia of the 60's, hence the band name being taken from 'Dagon's Reef' an adventure novel by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, as with the album's title.\nOpening track 'Ocean Sea' is a short instrumental piece clocking in at under two minutes long which really set the scene, a slow paced track with gentle ambient guitar and soft beats before a subtle electric guitar melody kicks in accompanied by more gentle beats which then fades away. There is this sense of nostalgia to the track which is quite compelling and also features the album's only vocals and it also comes across as quite atmospheric and a nice introduction to the album.\n'Sublime' is up next which consists of a brief piano introduction before a fuller progressive rock sound kicks in with some catchy guitar melodies and intricate drum work, as well as this there are some lovely deep and atmospheric vocals from Johanna Nöstling, it's a track that has a laid back vibe and plenty of prog rock influences mixed with the 70's psychedelia. There's a hint of the progressive electronic outfit Avalon here to the track, in particular with some of the guitar work, and also some of the keyboard work feels reminiscent to the likes of ELO.\n'Nocturne' the title track carries on in a similar style to 'Sublime' with it's combination of 70's prog guitar riffs and more ambient and progressive tones of atmospheric keyboards, it's a good one to sink into and the vocals from Johanna Nöstling work well here. 'Nocturne' has an easy flowing pace to it and is quite a mellow piece of prog rock with this hypnotic feel to it, yet also not a track that relies just on atmosphere to carry it along as all the other elements like the keyboards do their job of creating a full sound and there is a good balance between the vocals and instrumentation here and everything is delivered with confidence.\n'Nocturne' (the title track) is a nice way to start the album as it has this laid back and dreamy feel to it, it's a nice and mellow way to start one's prog journey, and the soundscape which it brings is quite intoxicating. 'Nocturne' is a short piece of music yet it is a strong opener to the album, as with 'Nocturne' the rest of the album follows along with a similar feel and style to the opener and is perhaps a good way to immerse oneself within the 'Nocturne' universe. 'Nocturne' consists of the instrumental 'Nocturne' which is more like a mix of atmospheric ambience with melodic guitar, delicate piano and drum fills accompanied by Johanna Nöstling's vocals, plus it also has the added elements of what sounds like samples of spoken language and vocal effects which adds another dimension to the piece.\n'Noise' comes next and it's an upbeat and catchy piece of progressive rock which has this heavy rhythm to it, the guitar is full of rich reverb which it's delivered with in a way that's quite hypnotic and the bass is deep and full of groove, while a heavy riff adds to this. There is a real sense of groove and attitude to the track with some great interplay between the keyboards and guitar and there is a wonderful feel of old school prog rock here mixed with some heavy riffing and an edginess to it, all of which makes for an enjoyable rock tune.\n'Nocturne' is back for another go and there's not a lot of difference between this and 'Nocturne' apart from it's slightly shorter in length by a matter of seconds; with 'Nocturne' however there is more instrumentation on display, including flute, synths and drums, which helps make the track a little fuller and more colourful overall. There's not a dramatic difference in style and tempo between both versions of the track, so that is the only real reason 'Nocturne' becomes redundant and thus doesn't really add much to the album.\n'Escape' is the first track on the album which has an almost dance or techno feel to it, though it's actually quite upbeat and not dark or depressing, more on a funkier side of things. 'Escape' has some good funky bass lines to it along with a rhythmic drum beat and a good electric guitar riff which also has a great sound to it. 'Escape' has a groovy feel to it, which is rather nice and this song along with 'Noise' are the heavier tunes on the album.\n'Out There' is the final track on the album, as on 'Out There' from the very outset the song just oozes with this relaxed feel to it, in particular with this laid back electric guitar which has this nice reverb effect to it. Again there's a great groove here and while this track has this nice laid back feel to it, there's not much progression or development, as 'Out There' is more of the same as the preceding tracks in that regard, still there is a sense of quality to the track itself which makes it a solid way to end this album. It's another short piece of music, coming to just three minutes in length, and in comparison with the rest of the tracks on the album it feels like a kind of 'outtake' or something added on after the main sessions ended, but all the other tracks are good enough that this isn't an issue as 'Out There' is still a good way to end the album.\nThe one thing that immediately stands out and comes to mind about the 'Nocturne' album is how this feels like the work of a band that is on the cusp of producing a full album without much in the way of changes, which also goes to say that this is more of an album in it's early stages of completion or something which has yet to be finished.\nDagon The Reef are a trio from Stockholm, Sweden, consisting of three talented musicians Erik Nösta...\nDagon's Reef have released a new track titled 'Waste Of Life' as a preview to their upcoming full-...\nFollowing from the success of his debut album 'The Unseen' back in 2014, singer-songwriter Tim Bric...\nNew from the underground of the music world is the debut album entitled 'The Unseen' from singer-s...\nThe debut album from Danish based duo The Hive Mind is a concept album of epic proportions, a so..."]], "filtered_resps": ["We are pleased to release this second album from Swedish psychedelic prog-rock outfit Dagon's Reef called 'Nocturne' this October 8th, a 10 track collection which has been three years in the making, as well as having a completely new line up, the only original member being guitarist and composer Erik Nilsson. 'Nocturne' is influenced by the 70's progressive rock bands of that era, particularly the work from German outfit Ash Ra Tempel, plus also taking its cue from the psychedelia of the 60's, hence the band name being taken from 'Dagon's Reef' an adventure novel by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, as with the album's title.\nOpening track 'Ocean Sea' is a short instrumental piece clocking in at under two minutes long which really set the scene, a slow paced track with gentle ambient guitar and soft beats before a subtle electric guitar melody kicks in accompanied by more gentle beats which then fades away. There is this sense of nostalgia to the track which is quite compelling and also features the album's only vocals and it also comes across as quite atmospheric and a nice introduction to the album.\n'Sublime' is up next which consists of a brief piano introduction before a fuller progressive rock sound kicks in with some catchy guitar melodies and intricate drum work, as well as this there are some lovely deep and atmospheric vocals from Johanna Nöstling, it's a track that has a laid back vibe and plenty of prog rock influences mixed with the 70's psychedelia. There's a hint of the progressive electronic outfit Avalon here to the track, in particular with some of the guitar work, and also some of the keyboard work feels reminiscent to the likes of ELO.\n'Nocturne' the title track carries on in a similar style to 'Sublime' with it's combination of 70's prog guitar riffs and more ambient and progressive tones of atmospheric keyboards, it's a good one to sink into and the vocals from Johanna Nöstling work well here. 'Nocturne' has an easy flowing pace to it and is quite a mellow piece of prog rock with this hypnotic feel to it, yet also not a track that relies just on atmosphere to carry it along as all the other elements like the keyboards do their job of creating a full sound and there is a good balance between the vocals and instrumentation here and everything is delivered with confidence.\n'Nocturne' (the title track) is a nice way to start the album as it has this laid back and dreamy feel to it, it's a nice and mellow way to start one's prog journey, and the soundscape which it brings is quite intoxicating. 'Nocturne' is a short piece of music yet it is a strong opener to the album, as with 'Nocturne' the rest of the album follows along with a similar feel and style to the opener and is perhaps a good way to immerse oneself within the 'Nocturne' universe. 'Nocturne' consists of the instrumental 'Nocturne' which is more like a mix of atmospheric ambience with melodic guitar, delicate piano and drum fills accompanied by Johanna Nöstling's vocals, plus it also has the added elements of what sounds like samples of spoken language and vocal effects which adds another dimension to the piece.\n'Noise' comes next and it's an upbeat and catchy piece of progressive rock which has this heavy rhythm to it, the guitar is full of rich reverb which it's delivered with in a way that's quite hypnotic and the bass is deep and full of groove, while a heavy riff adds to this. There is a real sense of groove and attitude to the track with some great interplay between the keyboards and guitar and there is a wonderful feel of old school prog rock here mixed with some heavy riffing and an edginess to it, all of which makes for an enjoyable rock tune.\n'Nocturne' is back for another go and there's not a lot of difference between this and 'Nocturne' apart from it's slightly shorter in length by a matter of seconds; with 'Nocturne' however there is more instrumentation on display, including flute, synths and drums, which helps make the track a little fuller and more colourful overall. There's not a dramatic difference in style and tempo between both versions of the track, so that is the only real reason 'Nocturne' becomes redundant and thus doesn't really add much to the album.\n'Escape' is the first track on the album which has an almost dance or techno feel to it, though it's actually quite upbeat and not dark or depressing, more on a funkier side of things. 'Escape' has some good funky bass lines to it along with a rhythmic drum beat and a good electric guitar riff which also has a great sound to it. 'Escape' has a groovy feel to it, which is rather nice and this song along with 'Noise' are the heavier tunes on the album.\n'Out There' is the final track on the album, as on 'Out There' from the very outset the song just oozes with this relaxed feel to it, in particular with this laid back electric guitar which has this nice reverb effect to it. Again there's a great groove here and while this track has this nice laid back feel to it, there's not much progression or development, as 'Out There' is more of the same as the preceding tracks in that regard, still there is a sense of quality to the track itself which makes it a solid way to end this album.

Does it exist? Is it some mystical entity that is the essence of everything, including the soul, or is it the very act of existing, the physical state that exists in our bodies?\nFor the sake of this article, let us assume that the term \"the spirit\" means all of the aforementioned things. Let's assume also that the spirit is the state that exists on an unmanifested plane (I'm not exactly sure where that plane exists, but I do know that a soul lives in its own space of consciousness, separate from the body. All of this can be read in the books, including The Secret of the Spirit and The Seven Spiritual Laws.\nNow, we can use this idea to explain many things. First, let's look at the notion of death. People who believe in reincarnation say that this state of being continues forever, while people of the belief that we have only one life have a concept of eternity. The concept of eternity is based upon a belief that there is something that exists beyond this mortal existence and is therefore an impossible state to achieve. So who is right? Well, here's an idea. If you believe in the spirit, and that the body is the materialization of the spirit, not the other way around, then it would follow that death is the final state of consciousness for the conscious entity, or \"soul\" as it's often referred to. It's no longer possible to experience a physical body, which is essentially what you have on Earth. But what happens when that physical body stops functioning? Well, it's only the physical body, but the spirit persists, as long as it is in this plane of existence. If you truly believe that the spirit is the essence of all things, and the spirit goes beyond the material plane, then it stands to reason that death is not the end, it's only a step backward. It's what makes the material body possible in the first place.\nAnd, it is in this state that we die, as it's the state of existence that is the most important, especially because it's the only way to go on in this world. It's not a question of how long a person lives, it's a question of what they did and what they became during their time here. That is the meaning of life, the meaning of the spirit.\nI realize that my theory is not entirely new, as others have theorized about the same idea, which is what makes it so easy to see it in a different light. The idea of death, while it's not entirely true, is based upon the idea that we will all eventually \"end,\" while we are still on this Earth. As our minds become evermore complex, we are able to create a \"spirit,\" because we become evermore conscious of our own existence.\nWith the creation of the soul, we are able to achieve a certain state of consciousness, as it is our brain that gives us this state, rather than our body or even our soul. This is why you feel such great pain or pleasure, because we all have that \"spirit,\" that \"soul\" as it's often referred to. This is the basis for everything, and as we gain more knowledge and experience, we gain additional information about ourselves, what we are and who we are, and thus we achieve a further understanding of who we truly are."]], "filtered_resps": ["This topic has been on my mind for quite some time, so here goes.\nSo what exactly is \"the spirit\"?

Does it mean to you that you should give Him more attention? Does it mean that you should go to church as you once did? Does it mean that you should pray and read the Bible more? Does it make you a better person?\nDo you believe that He really can help you in your life on earth, or was that just some talk? Do you really believe He can and will help you in the future, or is just something the church told you?\nIf you have done a lot of things for Him, were they really to please Him, and if not will it help to please Him for you to stop doing them?\nThe sin of blasphemy against the Holy Ghost is a very common sin, but we must understand what it really is.\nThis is about the Lord’s feelings toward it, the reason He can not forgive this sin, and about the things this will bring about.\nDo we not see how Mary is honored? She was the only one able to know the truth. Do we see how all those years she spent, in the quietness of prayer, without seeing any of what the Lord did in her day, she saw God’s love for her and his mercy and gave thanks for that love.\nDid we not see how that great prayer must have brought joy and peace to Her Soul? Did we not see how the Love of God was so strong in Mary that she did not see sin, but instead saw a love with which she could never be satisfied save in the service of her beloved?\nDid we not see all that love as the greatest gift that God could give her, yet she did not give it to Him?\nShe did not trust Him to come to her. She did not go to the Lord when He came. She could not even say “I am the servant of the Lord”.\nIt seems, like, the greatest gift of all is lost on us, when we could have the greatest gift in the world; if we only knew the gift was lost on us.\nDo we then see the purpose of the Lord’s Love in the matter? He wanted a Mother who trusted Him totally in the future. He also wanted her to live up to that love, but He did not wish her to give it away to a false religion.\nThe Love of the Lord is so great He could even forgive those who took from her the gift she was to give back to Him, if they repented of taking from her the gift He wanted to give her.\nThe same love is felt by Her Son, as he gives it back to Her in His Sacrifice upon the Cross. This gift, He would like to give it to Mary, but for the sake of the salvation of the world, He can not.\nWhy did he lose that love? Was it because he had no faith in the love he had, or because of his disobedience, which he knew was the one thing he truly loved?\nDid he not see that if he had faith in that love He would not do that? Did he not see that he was the one to take that thing away from Mary, and thus lost it all?\nHe was lost because He could no longer trust God to be true, to keep Mary safe forever, and to protect her from all harm when the time came. He had learned to hate God and to know His sin, but that did He know to be any less than God knew of sin.\nAnd why was this? Because if sin has power, so does the love of God, and the power is not in the sin itself, but in the love which is at war with sin.\nThe purpose of the Lord’s love in keeping Mary on earth in her own home, and in helping her to be faithful to the sacrifice she made, is so that He would have the honor of giving her back the gift He had once loved when she was born.\nWas He to be proud and to love her with a love He had loved in the past?\nWhy did He lose that love?\nHis obedience was disobedience; His faithlessness was faithfulness. He could not give himself with the love He loved.\nTherefore, if the Son of God has lost His love, what then shall we call this loss? We must understand it as He did.\nIf the son does not have the love of his father he is a disloyal and ungrateful servant, but when the son loses his love he becomes a traitor or rebel, who will leave you to the service of God, in exchange for the service of Satan, as the Lord did all who forsake Him and all who were lost and lost forever.\nWe have a new chance to understand what the Lord meant when He said, “I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life”. This is really a new and a bigger revelation about life and the Lord.\nThe Lord has told us His Love is not about the future, but about the past, the present, and the future.\nHis Love is for those who came to Him before they were, because when He told us our life could end in the future, it could also be a beginning."]], "filtered_resps": ["The first two of these posts are long and I wanted you to be able to read them.\nThese last two are shorter and I think you will gain a few very interesting thoughts.\nMy purpose in writing them is to help you see and experience that God’s mercy is infinite.

He also wanted her to live up to that love, but He did not wish her to give it away to a false religion.\nThe Love of the Lord is so great He could even forgive those who took from her the gift she was to give back to Him, if they repented of taking from her the gift He wanted to give her.\nThe same love is felt by Her Son, as he gives it back to Her in His Sacrifice upon the Cross. This gift, He would like to give it to Mary, but for the sake of the salvation of the world, He can not.\nWhy did he lose that love? Was it because he had no faith in the love he had, or because of his disobedience, which he knew was the one thing he truly loved?\nDid he not see that if he had faith in that love He would not do that? Did he not see that he was the one to take that thing away from Mary, and thus lost it all?\nHe was lost because He could no longer trust God to be true, to keep Mary safe forever, and to protect her from all harm when the time came. He had learned to hate God and to know His sin, but that did He know to be any less than God knew of sin.\nAnd why was this? Because if sin has power, so does the love of God, and the power is not in the sin itself, but in the love which is at war with sin.\nThe purpose of the Lord’s love in keeping Mary on earth in her own home, and in helping her to be faithful to the sacrifice she made, is so that He would have the honor of giving her back the gift He had once loved when she was born.\nWas He to be proud and to love her with a love He had loved in the past?\nWhy did He lose that love?\nHis obedience was disobedience; His faithlessness was faithfulness. He could not give himself with the love He loved.\nTherefore, if the Son of God has lost His love, what then shall we call this loss? We must understand it as He did.\nIf the son does not have the love of his father he is a disloyal and ungrateful servant, but when the son loses his love he becomes a traitor or rebel, who will leave you to the service of God, in exchange for the service of Satan, as the Lord did all who forsake Him and all who were lost and lost forever.\nWe have a new chance to understand what the Lord meant when He said, “I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life”. This is really a new and a bigger revelation about life and the Lord.\nThe Lord has told us His Love is not about the future, but about the past, the present, and the future.\nHis Love is for those who came to Him before they were, because when He told us our life could end in the future, it could also be a beginning."], "doc_hash": "45e3c16e2afcebba5bad6d617efcfd4260f74a2bcf0312b9bf9fa032f8dc294a", "prompt_hash": "3d0c1cf596181258a003e9f95c836c765d44353532e67c70d7dff48b05f64840", "target_hash": "e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855", "bypass": null}

That was one of the reasons why we decided to purchase it for our fleet - it was so new. The other reason to buy such a high-priced truck - and this is a real reason - we wanted customers to get excited.

It was expensive at first, but once you consider the price of the used vehicles you'd have to buy if you were to go that same route, the Gladiator came to us much more affordable.\nAs a customer, you get the added benefit of buying a brand new Gladiator Rubicon equipped just as you'd want one. The Rubicon comes equipped with the Jeep Active Drive Lock 4x4 system, Dana front and rear axles, electronic-locking differentials, TRX Level 1+ equipment, Rock-Trac 4x4 transfer case with a 4:1 low-range gear ratio, 2.72 axle ratio, and Bilstein® black mono-tube shocks.\nWith the four-wheel drive and upgraded off-road equipment, you'll get over the capability you'd expect. Some of the things we've had new owners do with their vehicle is taking them on a hunting trip, as well as over trails that would seem to be very difficult in a truck, and we've never had the problem so far. We've also had customers who are avid 4x4-ers and have taken them on all types of 4x4 trails to show their friends and family just how capable these trucks are.\nIf you're looking to buy a new Jeep Wrangler, a used vehicle isn't your only option. You could choose to buy a new vehicle, but if you're looking for your Wrangler or Gladiator to last a while without expensive repairs you'll want to consider a Gladiator Rubicon. The Jeep Gladiator Rubicon has a 3.6-liter Pentastar V-6 engine producing 290 hp, and it comes with four doors as well as a soft-top.\nThe Jeep Gladiator is an American legend, and it's proven to be the perfect vehicle for those who are looking for a versatile and capable pickup vehicle. You may think that a truck like this one with it's off-road technology and impressive towing capabilities will be outside of your price range but with this 2022 Gladiator Rubicon, you can have it all without breaking the bank."]], "filtered_resps": ["You won't find many places where you can purchase a brand new 2022 Jeep Gladiator Rubicon in an all-inclusive package under $60,000.

The Rubicon comes equipped with the Jeep Active Drive Lock 4x4 system, Dana front and rear axles, electronic-locking differentials, TRX Level 1+ equipment, Rock-Trac 4x4 transfer case with a 4:1 low-range gear ratio, 2.72 axle ratio, and Bilstein® black mono-tube shocks.\nWith the four-wheel drive and upgraded off-road equipment, you'll get over the capability you'd expect. Some of the things we've had new owners do with their vehicle is taking them on a hunting trip, as well as over trails that would seem to be very difficult in a truck, and we've never had the problem so far. We've also had customers who are avid 4x4-ers and have taken them on all types of 4x4 trails to show their friends and family just how capable these trucks are.\nIf you're looking to buy a new Jeep Wrangler, a used vehicle isn't your only option. You could choose to buy a new vehicle, but if you're looking for your Wrangler or Gladiator to last a while without expensive repairs you'll want to consider a Gladiator Rubicon. The Jeep Gladiator Rubicon has a 3.6-liter Pentastar V-6 engine producing 290 hp, and it comes with four doors as well as a soft-top.\nThe Jeep Gladiator is an American legend, and it's proven to be the perfect vehicle for those who are looking for a versatile and capable pickup vehicle. You may think that a truck like this one with it's off-road technology and impressive towing capabilities will be outside of your price range but with this 2022 Gladiator Rubicon, you can have it all without breaking the bank."], "doc_hash": "45e3c16e2afcebba5bad6d617efcfd4260f74a2bcf0312b9bf9fa032f8dc294a", "prompt_hash": "3d0c1cf596181258a003e9f95c836c765d44353532e67c70d7dff48b05f64840", "target_hash": "e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855", "bypass": null}

These snippets of information—or what Rexer refers to as the “found poems” that he makes his own—are then integrated into the body of Rexer’s ongoing meditation on the art of his time, a meditation that takes the form of these brief essays compiled into a collection of writings that makes apparent his “preoccupation with form and space, image and object, language, text and history.” Rexer doesn’t simply re-arrange these found artifacts or excerpts—he re-writes them, using all of the forms of contemporary art practice to shape and organize his work, from appropriation, copying or collage, to his own photography, drawings, and sculptures, including the sculpture of his found poems.\nLike many of his colleagues and readers, Rexer believes that “the best way for artists to understand their time” is “to absorb their own moment” and to use the “tools and weapons” of their chosen medium, in his case “the written word” to explore what it means to be an artist living in a particular moment and taking his place within the tradition of art history.\nLyle Rexer’s work is also unique because his art practice is so closely aligned to his academic activities, which include positions as the Director of Exhibitions and Collections at the University of South Florida in Tampa (1999-2001), Assistant Professor of Art History and Writing at NYU’s Gallery 400 in Chicago (2002–2004), Visiting Assistant Professor of Art History at the University of Miami (2004–2006), and his current position as the Director and Head of Curatorial Initiatives of UNTITLED Art Projects (NY).\nLyle Rexer has exhibited his work in major institutions and institutions worldwide, including the Smithsonian’s National Art Portfolio, The National Gallery, the High Museum, and the Center for Southern Folklore in Memphis.

The voluntary agreement focuses on meeting and maintaining a healthy human environment. It accomplishes this by eliminating emissions of ozone precursors, nitrogen oxide and volatile organic compounds (VOCs).\nThe agreement applies within boundaries with annual ozone mean daily maximum ozone concentrations greater than or equal to one part per billion by volume (ppbv). The Great Plains is one of the five regions designated by EPA for clean air enforcement under the Clean Air Act, which requires the agency to establish and implement enforceable requirements for controlling air emissions, both from stationary sources (manufacturing facilities, refineries and power plants, for example) and mobile sources (commercial aircraft and truck and train engines).\nThe states of Colorado, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas and Wyoming, together with Guam, have agreed to eliminate unnecessary or excessive emissions of ozone precursors and volatile organic compounds.

The voluntary agreement focuses on meeting and maintaining a healthy human environment. It accomplishes this by eliminating emissions of ozone precursors, nitrogen oxide and volatile organic compounds (VOCs).\nThe agreement applies within boundaries with annual ozone mean daily maximum ozone concentrations greater than or equal to one part per billion by volume (ppbv). The Great Plains is one of the five regions designated by EPA for clean air enforcement under the Clean Air Act, which requires the agency to establish and implement enforceable requirements for controlling air emissions, both from stationary sources (manufacturing facilities, refineries and power plants, for example) and mobile sources (commercial aircraft and truck and train engines).\nThe states of Colorado, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas and Wyoming, together with Guam, have agreed to eliminate unnecessary or excessive emissions of ozone precursors and volatile organic compounds. These emissions will be reduced by the states in several ways, including installing cleaner fuel systems for large trucks and industrial boilers, installing best available controls for facilities such as food processing plants and power and steel plants, and modifying industrial processes such as refineries and paper plants.

It's a new book with a completely new, simple but effective idea -- a book filled with Bible verses and a place to write how God's Word applies to your life.\n\"I know that you really love the Lord and you can see that He was faithful to you when you were struggling,\" she said. \"And that means a lot to me!\"\nI really value sharing God's truths because they are good, and He is good!

It's not the first 5-minute Bible I've read, but I've not come across any other daily devotional that focuses so completely on God's word! All 365 verses are written in a way that is both easy to read and fun to remember, and in a manner that's easy to share with others.\nBut the best part? Each verse is paired with a thoughtful commentary by popular ladies pastors like Priscilla Shires, Heather Varian and Amy Davis, as well as some of my favorite Christian women bloggers.\nIt's not a Bible that's designed to be kept secret!

It's a way to do God's work by talking about the book, because doing God's work is the purpose of devotional reading!\nI really like that \"doing God's work\" can be as simple as sharing a Bible verse with a coworker in the break room!\nBecause the purpose of each day's devotional is to bring out the truth that applies most specifically to you, you can share any way that's best for the person you're talking to.\nOr use the writing guide to share with your family over shared meals!\nMy husband is the biggest fan of this devotional because writing it is such a natural fit for our time together.

As you see how the Lord is showing himself in your life the more obvious things become to share with others.\nI really believe that it's this simple devotional that I've just enjoyed that helps me show how God's truths really do change us and shape our lives.\nThe very nature of the 5 minute guide makes it a simple, natural way to do more than read a devotional book. It's a way to do God's work by talking about the book, because doing God's work is the purpose of devotional reading!\nI really like that \"doing God's work\" can be as simple as sharing a Bible verse with a coworker in the break room!\nBecause the purpose of each day's devotional is to bring out the truth that applies most specifically to you, you can share any way that's best for the person you're talking to.\nOr use the writing guide to share with your family over shared meals!\nMy husband is the biggest fan of this devotional because writing it is such a natural fit for our time together. He keeps his eyes to the Lord as we eat and write a bit each day!\nFor example, we recently shared a sweet message from the book that talked of our wonderful God's grace.\nWhat verse have you been thinking or praying about recently that would bless your friends? If they weren't familiar with the Lord and reading the Bible, what verse would you want them to know?\nWhat is one truth you are grateful to God for right now?\nIs there a specific Bible promise that would bless and encourage your kids or siblings?\nWhat is something that you think of each day? Which is it, writing what's on your mind or writing what's on God's heart?\nNow you have a simple, natural way to start building new, deeper discipleship, family, and friendship relationships!\nThis devotional is just the first in a series of great books that have helped me share more actively about the Lord and the Bible in our household.\nAnd you can pick up these two other great books by following this link!\nHave you tried an e-devotional book on reading your Bible?\nCan you share how you'd use this one in your life?\nHow about a book that helps you share your faith with others?\nI hope you enjoyed the book and other resources highlighted on this blog post.\nAnd when you want another fun, easy way to share God's love with your friends and coworkers, I hope you'll come back and check out all these great posts!\nIf you found this post helpful, the easiest way to get every new post delivered directly to your inbox is to sign up for The Inspiration Gallery newsletter."], "doc_hash": "45e3c16e2afcebba5bad6d617efcfd4260f74a2bcf0312b9bf9fa032f8dc294a", "prompt_hash": "3d0c1cf596181258a003e9f95c836c765d44353532e67c70d7dff48b05f64840", "target_hash": "e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855", "bypass": null}

I also dined at The Smith where I sampled the lamb terrine, truffled poached egg and lamb pancetta and it was divine.\nIn case you’re curious about the recipes, I found some great ones on Epicurious.

It’s fun and not too hard, but it’s not the most common item to have in one’s larder.\nAlso, I think this should be posted as part of one of your “recipes” archives….\nI love this kind of recipes, as usually, I only use foie gras in soups and stews. Your recipe would be great, but I have never used truffled pearl for my terrines.\nWhat a great idea to pair charcuterie with truffled pearls! The terrine looks great.\nWow, I love the idea of foie gras and lamb terrine. The lamb terrine sounds divine! Now I want some!\nI like the idea of truffled pearls. I think I need to make some of my own.\nI was on the Smith’s website, and I think what you ordered, the egg in the glass was a deviled egg with a chicken liver mousse. They all look devine.\nI love foie gras and am thrilled they’ve found an interesting and affordable way to sell the dish!\nWow, the foie gras parfait looks soo yummy!\nBeautiful! I didn’t know they have that at The Smith. I think what makes it work so well is the foie gras – who knew foie gras and lamb terrine would work as well as it does?!\nI have been meaning to make terrine for my next party, and your is the best inspiration that i have seen so far!\nAnd the foie gras parfait sounds amazing!!!\nOh my, that looks so delicious. I have yet to try my hand at terrines myself but they look like too much fun to pass up. How many of those little cubes are there in the bottom of the dish?\nI love these little piggy terrines. They sound wonderful and are so cute! I also have made terrines twice in the past couple of years and I like the process and the end result, but I don’t think I like them that much.

I just learned how to make foie gras mousse and I am looking forward to experimenting with different flavours!\nI love the idea of truffled pearls in a terrine!!! I’ve only had foie gras once, and it had no bacon.\nI’ve yet to try my hand at charcuterie. Your terrine looks deliciously simple and easy to make. I’d never heard of truffled pearls either, they sound like a great addition to a terrine or stuffing!\nI just saw the terrine on a food show that recently aired on the Food Channel! But it still looks delicious! I’m glad that you like the lamb terrine at Breslin as well. Next time when I go back there, I’m sure to ask for it!

A couple favorite spots that I wanted to share were The Smith and The Breslin. What stands out most about these New York eateries was the use of house-made charcuterie. When I visited the Breslin, I ordered the chicken liver and foie gras parfait with truffled pearls and I was blown away. I also dined at The Smith where I sampled the lamb terrine, truffled poached egg and lamb pancetta and it was divine.\nIn case you’re curious about the recipes, I found some great ones on Epicurious. The links will give you the recipes for the chicken liver, foie gras and lamb terrine. For my favorite version of a lamb terrine, visit this entry on A Foodie’s Lament.\nThanks for the recipes.

How will they change the patient’s experience? How will they transform the provider’s experience? Which technology is best-suited for healthcare organizations? How can the industry keep up with these changes?\nWe recently sat down with James Vlasblom, the leader of IBM’s Healthcare & Life Sciences strategy and thought leadership, to discuss these questions and some of the top trends that will reshape the healthcare industry in 2018.\nQ: What are big challenges for companies operating in the healthcare industry?\nA: The healthcare industry continues to undergo transformations, specifically due to the technological improvements.\nI see the healthcare industry is a highly competitive industry to be in at the moment. We’re seeing major players moving into the industry. And even in the past half a year, you’ve seen major players moving into the industry. We’re seeing the major payers like CVS, Walmart, and Amazon move into healthcare with their own solutions to take on the existing players.\nWe’re also seeing technology players such as Google, Apple, and Microsoft move their technologies to healthcare. We are witnessing the digital transformation. Digital transformation is a big trend. What we’re seeing with these companies is their focus on cloud transformation and big data analytics. This can be used to analyze large volumes of data to drive the digital transformation agenda.\nIt’s imperative for healthcare providers and organizations to understand the new emerging technologies and to start applying them for better services.\nQ: How can a service provider’s digital maturity impact the industry?\nA: Service providers need to evaluate the current capability set. They need to check where they are currently positioned. Digital maturity is a crucial element of transformation. It’s about your capabilities around delivering services from a customer perspective. Providers can deliver the services by leveraging the digital technologies. They can also enhance their current capabilities in the digital space to achieve better outcomes for the people and organizations.\nQ: What are the new trends that will transform the healthcare industry in 2018?\nA: There are three main trends for healthcare this year. The first one is about personalization, where you can personalize your experience. We are now at a point where you can customize healthcare. You can personalize it by location, by the provider, by your location, and how you are using the solutions. Providers and providers can give better services to their customers based on their location and how they want to take care of their healthcare needs.\nThe second trend is around predictive analytics and insights. This is about driving and improving the predictive and prescriptive model. Organizations can use the data that’s being collected from providers for patient data, for patients and providers, into healthcare. It will allow them to analyze the data to drive the insights and use to improve their patient-centric model.\nThe next one is around cognitive computing. Cognitive computing is about using artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and robotics to analyze data and drive insights.\nQ: Which technology is best-suited for healthcare organizations?\nA: I believe, in the healthcare world, there’s a need to integrate technologies across clinical systems, back-office systems, and business processes. One of the technologies that will help transform healthcare is artificial intelligence (AI). AI is based on human intelligence and can interact with other humans in different ways. AI can be applied in almost all the major areas in the healthcare industry. It’s particularly important for the service industry, for example, by understanding your business requirements and optimizing the outcomes.\nIn healthcare, there’s a lot of data analysis to be done to understand the needs of patients and providers. We can use these tools to understand the needs and to make predictions based on the information provided.\nAnother technology, for example, is the IBM Watson Health, which applies the science of AI to drive the decisions. The decision has to be made in real time to provide the information to healthcare providers. We can use AI to analyze the data to identify patterns. You can identify the patterns based on the information provided and make predictions.\nIBM provides the technology for a lot of healthcare solutions. We provide tools, analytics, and capabilities needed for healthcare providers to make better decisions. The next step is how we can extend these technologies to improve the patient experience.\nQ: How can the industry keep up with these changes?\nA: Healthcare providers and organizations need to take advantage of the new emerging technologies. Providers need to invest in the emerging technologies. They need to focus on their own digital transformations by improving the digital capabilities in the current transformation to take on the big players.\nThe industry should keep up by investing in different technologies to stay relevant and to provide innovative solutions to the healthcare industry. By investing in technology solutions, healthcare industry can improve the quality of services provided to patients and drive better outcomes.\nThe healthcare industry in the US is the largest employer of all occupations in the country. In fact, it employs almost 20% of the total employees in the country.\nWith healthcare industry being one of the fastest growing industries, it is important that a healthcare organization knows very well what factors are driving its success and failure.\nAnd, if it is taking advantage of new innovative technology solutions, it is a bonus."]], "filtered_resps": ["What are the new trends that will transform the global healthcare industry in the near future?

Many of us know Bill as a dedicated member of the WMC and MCM community, working for an important part of the community. It is very important to understand the role of this person. Read on.\nThe purpose of this document is to share my observations, experiences and knowledge of our industry so that all participants may take advantage of the opportunities presented by our growing industry.\nMy name is Bill Zeban. I have been in the automotive industry for over 20 years. I have owned two dealerships, been a manufacturer district sales manager with Ford Motor Company and have spent the last 7 years as the CEO and President of the World Motorsport Council, a professional membership and certification division of SEMA. This organization was established to give an alternative for car dealers and other individuals involved in the automotive aftermarket to show their professionalism in business and technical competency. In the past, the aftermarket focused on the manufacturer’s certification, which was a good idea but it did not allow for the participation of independent shops. We are a non stock or member based association. Certification is not only good reputation marketing but also provides a base to expand our industry.\nThere are some misconceptions that seem to arise regularly about SEMA, the aftermarket and other related organizations and industries. I will share my insight and expertise on how the aftermarket functions in hopes of clarifying some of these issues.\nOver the last several years, SEMA has grown at a much faster pace than the rest of the aftermarket. The automotive aftermarket is a $20 billion industry. SEMA is a relatively small part of that but it provides many benefits to our segment. In 2007, over 75 percent of SEMA revenue came from auto parts and service. The remainder of revenue is derived from product development and licensing. Approximately 75 percent of manufacturers that are represented at SEMA use this organization for research to improve their products and services to dealers. We also provide dealer education services, and we work on legislation that benefits our members and the aftermarket as a whole.\nMany people are afraid that SEMA will only benefit large auto service operations, but the aftermarket in general represents smaller businesses than you may think. The average size of a SEMA dealer is two cars. This means that almost a million shops are represented in our member and certified member base. So the majority of people that you see at SEMA are not the big giants that you may anticipate and they are a huge portion of our society. Some are so small that they are not even listed in the Dealer Locator.\nAnother misconception is that most people that are involved in the SEMA show are members. In fact, most members do not visit or display at this show. Many members, especially the larger manufacturers, have found different means of reaching customers and dealers during the year with promotions and dealer meetings. However there is a significant portion that attend the show to see what is new, talk with competitors and suppliers and take advantage of the networking opportunities. Dealers and other independent shops that are members of SEMA find that this show is very effective for their businesses. By attending the show, they are able to reach more dealers and customers than they would have reached by taking a traditional trip to Las Vegas.\nMany of the manufacturers that sell to the aftermarket are at SEMA on a regular basis. This group is the majority of the members in SEMA and it includes several large manufacturers of automotive parts, tools, accessories and equipment. The manufacturers have the majority of their employees at SEMA because it is a highly productive time for them, providing opportunities to view our members’ cars, make purchases and learn about marketing services for their business. The manufacturers also use the show to meet with their independent sales managers, dealers and their own distributor network all under one roof. It is hard to explain the value of this event to an outsider.\nWe are not just an industry organization; we are an industry event. As I said before, the aftermarket is a $20 billion industry. Many of the major companies in this business find it difficult to attend a single show that reaches that amount in revenue. There are several multi day events that our industry attends in Las Vegas. Our members that are also manufacturers also set up trade exhibits that cover a much smaller area. In fact, most of their exhibits are just outside the entrance of the SEMA show and are just as effective as having them in the SEMA show floor. If a manufacturer cannot use one of their representatives to attend SEMA, they have the option to send a car and a banner that has their name on it. These display methods save them money and allow for the participation of many more people than they could hire for an entire show.\nSEMA also hosts many side events to entertain people who are not manufacturers and to keep them busy during these events. One of the most popular events is the annual SEMA Show Auto Corral, which features car shows on Friday evening and all day Saturday. On Friday night the Show Auto Corral features special shows open just to members of the automotive industry. Most of the members at this show are also members of SEMA. The show features special car shows for manufacturers, manufacturers specials for independent car care show and SEMA Show Cars. This is also a very popular event that does not have a cost to attend and the entry fees are low.\nOther events include the SEMA Cares Charity Classic held at the SEMA Show in Las Vegas in conjunction with a car auction. Since its inception in 2004, the Cares Charity Classic has raised an astounding over $8 million for charities.\nThe SEMA Show is very intense for us. We do our best to protect the interests of our members at our events by putting in place strict codes of conduct to regulate behavior at our events. We are very serious in this matter. SEMA has provided special training to our members and employees so that these issues are taken seriously.\nSEMA, like many other organizations, is comprised of many different personalities from a wide range of backgrounds and professions. As in any group, you will have some folks that will not represent your best interests. The best example of this is a small but vocal group of people that attempt to use the association to gain favor. SEMA does not and will always have a reputation of protecting the interests of its members. This is our primary responsibility to the aftermarket.\nWe must realize that if some people would stop playing games and were more concerned with the value of the organization we would find we had the support of a lot more people.\nThere are other organizations that represent the aftermarket with the same professional standards that SEMA does. The major automotive association (AMA) does not serve the after market as a whole and has more of an auto parts focus, not just automotive performance parts.\nSince 2003, I have worked with the AMA in an effort to become more involved. The AMA and I have had three meetings in the last year that I know of and they seem very concerned with their members. At our first meeting, our association was being reviewed by the AMA to see if we would be qualified to become a member. At the second meeting, there was still not a clear answer and the AMA made some changes to their code requirements for membership. To say that a code of ethics does not work or is not necessary is not the case with SEMA. We have to constantly be on guard to keep the right kind of people from joining our organization.\nSince my meeting with the AMA board, I have continued to see a lack of understanding of the difference between SEMA and the AMA and that SEMA provides a better quality membership and a level of service that the AMA cannot provide. There have been several recent instances where AMA members have approached us about membership issues. It is very discouraging for SEMA to see how some people are misrepresenting our association to members. It also makes you aware of those that don’t understand what a level of commitment it takes for our association to be successful.\nIt is easy for someone to tell you what is good about an organization in one sentence. After that, things go downhill. For that reason, I decided to go into detail about what we do and why we do it, so you may see how much work goes into our association.\nWe do not have the time or the resources to respond to questions for every company that has a problem or just needs to talk. We can only take care of the requests that are submitted to us through our website. We have received several calls and written letters from companies outside our organization. I have never seen a website or association that has as much information as ours, but there is no reason to have access to our member or dealer service data or to ask us questions. The most important reason is that we are a professional membership association and we take very seriously the responsibilities of preserving our reputation.\nI feel that you are not only the first point of contact for a company that has any issue with SEMA. You act as the main communicator with the company for that company and can answer a lot of the questions that are asked of us. As the first point of contact, you seem to see our organization through a different lens. All it takes is a few positive or negative responses to start making a name for your service or your company. I know this because I have seen it happen on several occasions and that also happens all the time on the Internet and when I go on the SEMA website!\nOur website is always being upgraded and we have added a members’ area where everyone can update or add to their existing content. We have added a page that is updated by the AMA to show the code of ethics which has been passed on by the association.

I think you'd need at least 3 ranks of knowledge: nature (and maybe intelligence) as well as perception to actually make use of it, but even without it I think it'd still be quite nice.\n\nAnyway, it's definitely an interesting feat, and I'd never seen anyone do anything like it before.

However, there are numerous soft skills that can be learned as well. To better your chances of securing the position of your choice, you should acquire these skills.\nThese skills are important for a job seeker’s success. These skills not only help you stand out from the crowd. Even if you are seeking a job where your work experience is all that is required, soft skills can prove to be just as important as technical skills.\nIf you’re not sure how to improve your soft skills, you may need to get some outside help. Our team at Cielo has the expertise and experience to assist you in improving your soft skills and, as a result, your chances of landing that perfect job.\nHard Skills – Hard skills refer to any skills relevant to the job you are applying for, ranging from programming languages to accounting principles. Since it is easier to teach individuals hard skills, they are more useful than soft skills.\nSoft Skills – These are attributes that are more difficult to teach. They refer to how you conduct yourself in your daily interpersonal interactions in a variety of settings. These skills are difficult to quantify and evaluate, but having them will set you apart as an employee. Soft skills are extremely beneficial to job applicants since they help to improve the candidate’s ability to interact positively with employees and management, and are valued by corporate leaders in a wide range of industries, both in the United States and abroad.\nInterpersonal Skills: These skills can be acquired through training and are useful in any workplace. They are essential for teamwork, as they help to establish trust in one’s ability to interact with coworkers and clients. The most difficult skills to learn are communication skills, such as active listening skills, or how to interact with other team members in an interpersonal or group setting. In fact, active listening skill is very difficult. You must be able to hear other people and truly understand what they have to say in order to truly listen effectively.\nA critical component of interpersonal skills is the ability to communicate clearly. It is difficult to have a conversation with other people without communicating effectively. The ability to effectively resolve conflicts is essential for any job position or organization. It can be difficult to stay calm and avoid getting agitated in the most difficult situations, but it is necessary. Having good communication skills can help you resolve conflicts in a manner that is both productive and efficient.\nOther interpersonal skills that can be developed include the ability to motivate others, to effectively delegate tasks, and to work well as part of a team or leader. Motivation is a characteristic that sets you apart. It will determine the outcome of any project that you are assigned. Because motivation is so easy to acquire, it is often ignored by students and employees. It is important to understand that motivation can be learned, but it should be nurtured in order to achieve the highest possible results.\nDelegation skills are another critical skill. Delegation is the act of assigning tasks to someone else in order to free up your time for more important activities. One of the most common mistakes that are made in the workplace is that one employee will assign too many tasks or assignments but won’t follow through on what has been assigned. If one person becomes too involved in the assignment, it can make the whole team sluggish and unproductive. Other employees may not even understand what has been assigned to them, so there is no point in trying to implement new ideas. It is easy for one person or group to take over another’s workload, and it can cause resentment and a decreased level of trust between workers.\nTeamwork skills can come into play when a project requires more than one person. Because each individual has their own strengths and weaknesses, it is important to assign tasks based on what the team needs to accomplish. This is why it is important to train yourself and your employees how to work together as a team. When a team is organized and operates smoothly, productivity is increased and there are fewer employee turnovers. This means a better workplace for everyone.\nThe importance of customer service skills cannot be overestimated. A good customer service team is instrumental in the success of any business. In fact, it is necessary for the success of any organization in any service or business. Having good customer service skills can help you to effectively deal with customers, keep the customer happy and make sure that the product or service provided meets customer expectations.\nA customer service employee must be able to identify problems, make suggestions, and resolve issues quickly. This is done by asking the customer about his or her needs and expectations, then making suggestions and using resources to make sure that the product or service is delivered on time. Customer service representatives can do a large amount of research on their own, so they are highly valued. In addition, customer service representatives often receive recognition and promotions.\nAs you can see, soft skills are just as important as technical skills when it comes to finding and keeping a job. You will not only stand out from the crowd by showing off your communication skills, but you will impress other employees and leaders.\nIf you’re unsure about how to improve your soft skills and strengthen them, you’re in luck!

The proposal, announced by Europe’s Finance Ministers, has sparked a wave of reactions from industry stakeholders and policymakers alike, who’ve questioned the proposed move, its implications and the overall effect the regulatory scheme could have on crypto and Web3 ecosystems.\nThe proposed rules could have dramatic consequences for the crypto industry in Europe, making compliance to regulations a necessity to operate within the continent, requiring crypto services companies to adopt Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) protocols such as those introduced by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) recommendations, to comply with local laws.\nCrypto businesses must be able to maintain KYC and AML records and, due to their nature, they are often seen as inherently risky for money laundering, which can lead to the disruption of the entire business, and therefore, the overall development of the European crypto space.\nAlthough European authorities aren’t particularly welcoming to crypto, crypto-friendly nations like Malta and Switzerland are taking the lead in this industry, introducing laws to support the crypto community and boost digital assets’ adoption, while the UK appears to be lagging behind.\nAmidst growing regulatory pressure, European crypto businesses may look towards offshore jurisdictions that are less stringent when it comes to cryptocurrency regulation. For startups specifically, being able to operate freely or with very loose restrictions is what they value most, which is why jurisdictions such as Malta, Costa Rica, Singapore, Malta, Panama, and Switzerland attract a huge number of crypto projects every year.\nWhat exactly is the FATF, and, most importantly, who is impacted by this new regulatory framework?\nFATF, short for Financial Action Task Force, is a global regulatory body that sets standards to combat money laundering and other financial crimes.\nIn the crypto industry, the FATF has two main guidelines, one set of standards aimed at traditional financial institutions, and another, the Travel Rule standard, which regulates how crypto companies must comply with its guidelines or face heavy fine penalties.\nIn an effort to combat money laundering, FATF requires traditional financial institutions and crypto companies to maintain KYC, identify their users, and report suspicious transactions which could be related to money laundering or other fraudulent activities.\nHowever, FATF also requires traditional financial institutions to adhere to “travel” rules, which specify that “services providers must identify and share information about the payer of money and the beneficiary of money or virtual currency” when a transactional service like a wire transfer or a credit card payment occurs.\nThe implication of the FATF travel rule standard was that crypto was, for the first time, recognized as a means of payments, and as a result, as a target for AML/CTF purposes. As such, crypto-to-crypto transactions, and transfers from digital wallets, were now a target for AML/CTF verification, despite the fact that crypto is often used by people in countries with high numbers of unregulated or illegal financial activities, which have high risk levels for money laundering.\nRegulators in different jurisdictions may interpret the FATF standards in different ways, putting their national policies in conflict with international regulations, which is exactly what happened at the time with the EU, who tried to implement the FATF standards while they were still in progress and lacking any concrete definition.\nIn 2020, despite the continued lack of clarity regarding how to apply the FATF standards on crypto transactions, the EU took a step forward and adopted a proposal for a “market standard” that set a minimum level for AML/CTF regulation, in anticipation of more clarity from FATF.\nThe draft law, although aimed at all banks and financial institutions, can be interpreted by regulators as an attempt to apply regulations on crypto operators in the EU. The draft law would prohibit all digital asset service firms from accessing the European financial sector and operate within the EU without a license or a “PassPorting” mechanism. PassPorting is a regulatory mechanism that allows European authorized institutions the ability to provide services in another EU country. It is commonly used by financial institutions in the crypto space as a way to bypass regulations in other jurisdictions.\nHowever, the fact that crypto businesses are not currently required to follow AML/CTF policies already in place in many jurisdictions puts crypto at a disadvantage when compared to traditional financial institutions operating in the same jurisdiction. Therefore regulators may view the crypto sector too risky for AML/CTF compliance if they are operating independently.\nThe EU proposal has been met with significant backlash by the crypto industry.\nAmong the main criticisms of the proposal is that the EU’s current draft law lacks clarity.\nThe vagueness of the proposal makes it difficult for crypto businesses to gauge what policies they must follow, and whether they can benefit from the same regulatory systems used by traditional financial institutions.\nThe lack of clarity also makes it difficult for EU authorities to understand what cryptocurrency businesses can offer, and, therefore, how their financial assets can be properly regulated, which is also why crypto companies are now looking elsewhere for opportunities in less onerous jurisdictions.\nIf the current proposal is approved by the European Parliament, which has yet to be approved, crypto companies operating in the EU face heavy obstacles and potential disruption of their businesses.\nFor crypto businesses operating in the EU, complying with AML/CTF policies and the European market standards is mandatory if they want to stay operational in the EU, or access EU financial markets for both fiat and crypto services.\nThere are numerous crypto service providers operating in Germany, but there are other countries with more lenient crypto regulations, such as Austria, Malta, Switzerland, and even Singapore whose stringent compliance policies will attract more crypto companies in the future.\nIt’s clear that the crypto industry needs to be regulated, but how the regulations are applied, and the actual implications could mean the difference between a thriving business and the complete cessation of operations."]], "filtered_resps": ["In December, the European Commission announced its plans to propose new legislation that would regulate crypto-assets under the same terms as conventional financial services and products.

That is, showing instead of telling or using a different device to describe it (e.g. showing through dialogue, or using a character to repeat the words, even though the character is already aware of it.) I'll ask myself if it isn't better to tell a thing once or twice so I can get it done, instead of using a device, or even better, putting it as dialogue - for which the character would say it.

They don't tend to use many devices to show events, but instead use the simple, matter-of-fact way they tell things. For instance, one I really like, Steven Erikson, will just go ahead and describe something, without putting any filter in front of it. In contrast, say, I might be hesitant to say something like: \"Djall took his axe out of the hole he had burned in the floor, and threw it into the flames.\" I realize the person knows what just happened, but I wonder - can I express the information I want to convey, in another way that isn't so telling?\n\nAgain, here I want to address the caveats I mentioned earlier.

It also has the advantage of quick refueling times: according to the WLTP certification criteria, the Taycan takes around half an hour for a recharge to 80 percent. The E-Tron, with a 90 kWh battery, reaches the same level after an hour.\nPorsche expects to launch more than 100 electrified models by 2025, while by 2030 its annual sales of electrified and battery-powered vehicles should reach one billion. But the company also wants to remain flexible – the 911, for example, can still be purchased with a gasoline engine.\nThe sports car manufacturer does not want to be a player in the electric car market in the coming years. That is why Porsche wants to be more flexible by combining electric propulsion with combustion engine technology. The future model for everyday use thus becomes a hybrid.\nWhile the Porsche Cayenne has been the model for electric drive for a long time, the 911 and Macan have to wait a little longer.

There is also the intention of expanding the range by plug-in hybrids, which are also to be deployed under the label 992.\nThe first information about the Cayman models for the next generation have already been announced: The front is said to be more upright than today and therefore also sportier, while the rear could benefit from a less aggressive character line.\nAt the same time, the next-generation 718 Boxster is already in the starting blocks. This model will also receive an electrically assisted mid-engine hybrid system, with a drive concept based on the Taycan and the Panamera Sports Turismo.

The mid-range sports car, for example, comes on the market from 2020 under the names 718 and 728.\nIn both models, the new 48-volt starter-generator should increase the maximum torque by 20 percent and increase the fuel efficiency by 15 percent. The electric sports car e-Boxter concept, presented at the 2013 Geneva Motor Show on a concept of the Cayman S, is also still at the stage of planning.

They didn't really care about truth in the least; they were driven by a passion to persecute and even kill Him.\nThen we move to those who didn't have an immediate problem with Him. They appreciated Him for what He was – and so they made the effort to come and actually listen to Him. At first, that was all they did – listen – before they dismissed Him. But they were willing to make the effort, and so they went on to do more.\nThat's where we are at this point in Mark. \"But He moved on through more cities and villages... until He reached his destination.\" If you recall, Jesus went to Jerusalem to start His public ministry where He went about carrying out the mission God had given His Son. When He got to Jordan, He was baptized by John who prepared Him to minister. Now He has gone throughout Galilee – He hasn't even spent a lot of time in Jerusalem – and they're continuing to listen... but they're continuing to be confused by just what they're hearing.\nI am convinced that Jesus didn't have any problem talking with those who were simply curious. His problem was with those who did not want to hear; who had a different agenda; who were driven by an agenda to see Christ crucified again – as they viewed it.\nI do not know how many will see this sermon series as relevant today since we are in the midst of the coronavirus and social distancing. I have no idea how this disease will turn out or how much worse it might become. But one thing I do know and that is if the current problem continues we need to find different ways to connect.\nI believe and have always believed that churches need to find ways to connect with people in a virtual way. For us that means having online services on Sunday morning and having them available on video later in the day so people can view them if they want. But there should be other ways to maintain that connection and I think we'll find out as the days continue.\nIn the meantime, for me it is not as important what we're going through now as it is where do churches go from here – what can they still have on Sunday morning that people can view online to get connected.\nAs I look at it today, the important part for us as churches is how will we meet people's needs online rather than in person? It could be about something as simple as putting video on the website or making a video available in social media for people to watch later, or, if a church is equipped to do livestreaming, we can put them up there on a regular basis and hopefully people will feel more connected as a result.\nNow in the midst of all of that, we are continuing our series based on Mark's gospel. So far Mark's gospel is a series of events; and in this series it has been in a somewhat reverse chronological order. Now he goes back to what he considered the key point of Jesus's ministry and that would be the beginning.\nLast week, Mark finished the account of Jesus being questioned by some Jews in Jerusalem because He had healed some on the Sabbath. Although we know that Jesus did a fair amount of His healing ministry on the Sabbath so as to get this message out, this incident is unique. Mark has never given any account of what happened, and he goes into a fair amount of detail of Jesus' response. In the process he makes some very important points.\nIn that incident Jesus does something that the religious leaders found extremely offensive. He was healing on the Sabbath. He healed the man with the ear. He healed him through healing the man with the sick. He was taking this most basic physical need of all and, not only taking care of it but restoring it, or even perhaps restoring him to his normal self. That's what He showed the man he needed – that his ear was healed enough to be attached once again. That's what He was doing.\nAnd so Mark tells that He healed him and he had so much compassion on him that He healed him so that he could be a witness to what God wants people to be – restored and re-connected. And he was also a witness at the same time to why this needed to be changed and that was to provide testimony to what God has done. And so Mark is telling us that Jesus did this to provide testimony about what Jesus did so they would remember in the days to come what He did about His ministry on the Sabbath.\nNow that's kind of where we are going to pick up today. In the account of that healing last week, Mark told us some of what He said – but now we're going to go deeper into what He said to them.\nI believe that in this scene what He said to them was one of the most significant things that He ever said and was one of the most significant things that He ever taught anyone. Although it has been written down by His disciples and the disciples that gathered around Him, the world at large, with the exception of a very few followers, has forgotten His teachings and He was saying such profound things that people would find difficult to understand it in a short period of time. They would have to learn and spend time together for people to get the understanding, but He still continued to teach them.\nSo in this scene we get a little insight into the mindset of the Jews at this time, which is a mindset that has never been completely removed. Jesus's response to what He said in Mark 3:4, you remember, was for them to be offended. And if He could only get them to understand it and not be offended, then they would be saved and they would understand and they would see the truth and the way things ought to be.\n\"The disciples said to Him, 'Teacher, we know that you are true and care for no one. You have no respect for the high official because you care for no one. \nIn other words, the Jewish leadership has a perception of who Jesus is. Jesus isn't just a Galilean; He's from Nazareth – Nazareth of Galilee. They say He's the product of the low end of Israel. They are very sure that Jesus is a person who is the ultimate hypocrite. The fact is the Jews knew that if they did anything on the Sabbath they could be prosecuted. That was the law. So, Jesus is a hypocrite because He is being a hypocrite; He's breaking the law, and He's doing it on the Sabbath.\nThen there is the fact that His disciples are plucking heads of grain. The fact is He is breaking the law by not letting them gather grains to satisfy their physical need. Now that is not the full story of the law of the Sabbath. For instance, the command to work on the Sabbath is for one's physical needs, and God has given us what's necessary for our needs and He has permitted it. And that's just one aspect of why they were breaking the law.\nBut that is a law that they are very sure that Christ is in violation of. The fact that Christ allowed His disciple to pluck grain and eat it shows, again, that He is in violation of the law.\nBut that's not all about the Sabbath – that's just a portion of what He said about what the Sabbath is for. He is making a much more profound point. First of all, Jesus says, \"In what way is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or bad?\" Jesus is asking because it seemed to be that the way He was doing these works was not done with their authority so that He would make a clear point about what He's teaching.\nThis is just a short bit of an explanation about how the Sabbath is for us to do good for others and not for Christ to be violating the law – for us to be obeying it. And as it turned out, He had just performed an amazing action with His disciples. First of all, if people broke the Sabbath law and were seen by others, they would be stoned without question. In the midst of breaking the Sabbath law, He allowed His disciples to pluck grain. He has just done an amazing thing. In fact, they say He is making a mockery of the Sabbath because He permits them to pluck the heads of grain, which is breaking the law.\nNow the question is: What law did they break? The answer is the law on the Sabbath concerning work. They were permitted to gather grain. But they were supposed to make sure they gathered enough grain for their physical needs for the Sabbath and they were not, from the context, plucking the heads of grain and collecting them for their physical needs – unless they were plucking that grain to be eaten.\nThe Pharisees had a good legal case that Jesus was breaking the law because, in the culture, it was very difficult at certain times to get through the day and do anything physical at all if you didn't have some food for a meal. So they said that they were only plucking the head of grain. They said that they were not going to pluck the grain until the end of the Sabbath. However, He said He would not be the judge on whether that interpretation was right, or whether it was wrong. And He said, \"Is it lawful to do good on the Sabbath?\"\nIn verse 18 when He quotes from Isaiah, He is quoting from the \"Prophets\" not from the Old Testament but from Isaiah. When he mentions the Prophets, in the original text it said \"the prophets.\" The text uses \"the prophets\" as a collective noun.\nIn the original text it uses a plural noun, \"the Law.\" The text"]], "filtered_resps": ["At first it seemed to me that we would not get any further than those who first heard Him – some of whom gave Him no more than a casual passing attention before they turned sharply away in disgust. They didn't really care about truth in the least; they were driven by a passion to persecute and even kill Him.\nThen we move to those who didn't have an immediate problem with Him. They appreciated Him for what He was – and so they made the effort to come and actually listen to Him. At first, that was all they did – listen – before they dismissed Him. But they were willing to make the effort, and so they went on to do more.\nThat's where we are at this point in Mark. \"But He moved on through more cities and villages... until He reached his destination.\" If you recall, Jesus went to Jerusalem to start His public ministry where He went about carrying out the mission God had given His Son. When He got to Jordan, He was baptized by John who prepared Him to minister. Now He has gone throughout Galilee – He hasn't even spent a lot of time in Jerusalem – and they're continuing to listen... but they're continuing to be confused by just what they're hearing.\nI am convinced that Jesus didn't have any problem talking with those who were simply curious. His problem was with those who did not want to hear; who had a different agenda; who were driven by an agenda to see Christ crucified again – as they viewed it.\nI do not know how many will see this sermon series as relevant today since we are in the midst of the coronavirus and social distancing. I have no idea how this disease will turn out or how much worse it might become. But one thing I do know and that is if the current problem continues we need to find different ways to connect.\nI believe and have always believed that churches need to find ways to connect with people in a virtual way. For us that means having online services on Sunday morning and having them available on video later in the day so people can view them if they want. But there should be other ways to maintain that connection and I think we'll find out as the days continue.\nIn the meantime, for me it is not as important what we're going through now as it is where do churches go from here – what can they still have on Sunday morning that people can view online to get connected.\nAs I look at it today, the important part for us as churches is how will we meet people's needs online rather than in person? It could be about something as simple as putting video on the website or making a video available in social media for people to watch later, or, if a church is equipped to do livestreaming, we can put them up there on a regular basis and hopefully people will feel more connected as a result.\nNow in the midst of all of that, we are continuing our series based on Mark's gospel. So far Mark's gospel is a series of events; and in this series it has been in a somewhat reverse chronological order. Now he goes back to what he considered the key point of Jesus's ministry and that would be the beginning.\nLast week, Mark finished the account of Jesus being questioned by some Jews in Jerusalem because He had healed some on the Sabbath. Although we know that Jesus did a fair amount of His healing ministry on the Sabbath so as to get this message out, this incident is unique. Mark has never given any account of what happened, and he goes into a fair amount of detail of Jesus' response. In the process he makes some very important points.\nIn that incident Jesus does something that the religious leaders found extremely offensive. He was healing on the Sabbath. He healed the man with the ear. He healed him through healing the man with the sick. He was taking this most basic physical need of all and, not only taking care of it but restoring it, or even perhaps restoring him to his normal self. That's what He showed the man he needed – that his ear was healed enough to be attached once again. That's what He was doing.\nAnd so Mark tells that He healed him and he had so much compassion on him that He healed him so that he could be a witness to what God wants people to be – restored and re-connected. And he was also a witness at the same time to why this needed to be changed and that was to provide testimony to what God has done. And so Mark is telling us that Jesus did this to provide testimony about what Jesus did so they would remember in the days to come what He did about His ministry on the Sabbath.\nNow that's kind of where we are going to pick up today. In the account of that healing last week, Mark told us some of what He said – but now we're going to go deeper into what He said to them.\nI believe that in this scene what He said to them was one of the most significant things that He ever said and was one of the most significant things that He ever taught anyone. Although it has been written down by His disciples and the disciples that gathered around Him, the world at large, with the exception of a very few followers, has forgotten His teachings and He was saying such profound things that people would find difficult to understand it in a short period of time. They would have to learn and spend time together for people to get the understanding, but He still continued to teach them.\nSo in this scene we get a little insight into the mindset of the Jews at this time, which is a mindset that has never been completely removed. Jesus's response to what He said in Mark 3:4, you remember, was for them to be offended. And if He could only get them to understand it and not be offended, then they would be saved and they would understand and they would see the truth and the way things ought to be.\n\"The disciples said to Him, 'Teacher, we know that you are true and care for no one. You have no respect for the high official because you care for no one. \nIn other words, the Jewish leadership has a perception of who Jesus is. Jesus isn't just a Galilean; He's from Nazareth – Nazareth of Galilee. They say He's the product of the low end of Israel. They are very sure that Jesus is a person who is the ultimate hypocrite. The fact is the Jews knew that if they did anything on the Sabbath they could be prosecuted. That was the law. So, Jesus is a hypocrite because He is being a hypocrite; He's breaking the law, and He's doing it on the Sabbath.\nThen there is the fact that His disciples are plucking heads of grain. The fact is He is breaking the law by not letting them gather grains to satisfy their physical need. Now that is not the full story of the law of the Sabbath. For instance, the command to work on the Sabbath is for one's physical needs, and God has given us what's necessary for our needs and He has permitted it. And that's just one aspect of why they were breaking the law.\nBut that is a law that they are very sure that Christ is in violation of. The fact that Christ allowed His disciple to pluck grain and eat it shows, again, that He is in violation of the law.\nBut that's not all about the Sabbath – that's just a portion of what He said about what the Sabbath is for. He is making a much more profound point. First of all, Jesus says, \"In what way is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or bad?\" Jesus is asking because it seemed to be that the way He was doing these works was not done with their authority so that He would make a clear point about what He's teaching.\nThis is just a short bit of an explanation about how the Sabbath is for us to do good for others and not for Christ to be violating the law – for us to be obeying it. And as it turned out, He had just performed an amazing action with His disciples. First of all, if people broke the Sabbath law and were seen by others, they would be stoned without question. In the midst of breaking the Sabbath law, He allowed His disciples to pluck grain. He has just done an amazing thing. In fact, they say He is making a mockery of the Sabbath because He permits them to pluck the heads of grain, which is breaking the law.\nNow the question is: What law did they break? The answer is the law on the Sabbath concerning work. They were permitted to gather grain. But they were supposed to make sure they gathered enough grain for their physical needs for the Sabbath and they were not, from the context, plucking the heads of grain and collecting them for their physical needs – unless they were plucking that grain to be eaten.\nThe Pharisees had a good legal case that Jesus was breaking the law because, in the culture, it was very difficult at certain times to get through the day and do anything physical at all if you didn't have some food for a meal. So they said that they were only plucking the head of grain. They said that they were not going to pluck the grain until the end of the Sabbath. However, He said He would not be the judge on whether that interpretation was right, or whether it was wrong. And He said, \"Is it lawful to do good on the Sabbath?\"\nIn verse 18 when He quotes from Isaiah, He is quoting from the \"Prophets\" not from the Old Testament but from Isaiah.

This is really cool. So far I’m liking it.\nA: Oh wow, I think all of them. I feel like the books I hate are either so horrible it’s hard for me to finish them or not for me because my brain cannot seem to understand it. I think the only thing I actually threw out to the wall was a book called “It” because it was too scary for me.

I think if I tried reading them I would break my eyesight. Although that makes me want to try reading physical books.\n4. What was your greatest moment as a reader?\nA: I think the most moment for my reading was when I tried reading adult books and I ended up loving it. I feel like I found the best genre for my tastes.\nA: I have always been inspired by so many books and authors so I’ve said this before but I think the most one who has inspired me the most is probably Tamora Pierce. She’s a legend and I love her writing and as a author. She’s made me want to try my hand at writing more fantasy.\n6. What was your greatest disappointment?\nA: The last one that comes to mind was a book that I gave 2 stars to and I was surprised when I was reviewing it. I wasn’t really impressed because I had already read the first few book and wasn’t as into it. So yeah, that’s been a downer but I’m glad I read it because it helped me decide maybe not to continue.\n7. What book would you recommend to anyone?\nA: Mostly YA books. It’s where I’m at right now.\n8. What is your worst habit?\nA: I’m sure this happens to most bloggers but I’m quite lazy when it comes to reviewing. So yeah, that’s a habit I can change.\n9. What’s your favorite blog post?\nA: I think it’s these questions I did. I really enjoyed answering them. I like being creative with these posts and I hope I do more questions.\n10. What is something you can’t stop watching?\nA: I watch You tube videos all the time. I watch anything on there. I even watch things on there that I never even heard about. I don’t have an addictive thing for YouTube right now but I could watch it all day if I just let it.\n11.

'Nocturne' is influenced by the 70's progressive rock bands of that era, particularly the work from German outfit Ash Ra Tempel, plus also taking its cue from the psychedelia of the 60's, hence the band name being taken from 'Dagon's Reef' an adventure novel by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, as with the album's title.\nOpening track 'Ocean Sea' is a short instrumental piece clocking in at under two minutes long which really set the scene, a slow paced track with gentle ambient guitar and soft beats before a subtle electric guitar melody kicks in accompanied by more gentle beats which then fades away. There is this sense of nostalgia to the track which is quite compelling and also features the album's only vocals and it also comes across as quite atmospheric and a nice introduction to the album.\n'Sublime' is up next which consists of a brief piano introduction before a fuller progressive rock sound kicks in with some catchy guitar melodies and intricate drum work, as well as this there are some lovely deep and atmospheric vocals from Johanna Nöstling, it's a track that has a laid back vibe and plenty of prog rock influences mixed with the 70's psychedelia. There's a hint of the progressive electronic outfit Avalon here to the track, in particular with some of the guitar work, and also some of the keyboard work feels reminiscent to the likes of ELO.\n'Nocturne' the title track carries on in a similar style to 'Sublime' with it's combination of 70's prog guitar riffs and more ambient and progressive tones of atmospheric keyboards, it's a good one to sink into and the vocals from Johanna Nöstling work well here. 'Nocturne' has an easy flowing pace to it and is quite a mellow piece of prog rock with this hypnotic feel to it, yet also not a track that relies just on atmosphere to carry it along as all the other elements like the keyboards do their job of creating a full sound and there is a good balance between the vocals and instrumentation here and everything is delivered with confidence.\n'Nocturne' (the title track) is a nice way to start the album as it has this laid back and dreamy feel to it, it's a nice and mellow way to start one's prog journey, and the soundscape which it brings is quite intoxicating. 'Nocturne' is a short piece of music yet it is a strong opener to the album, as with 'Nocturne' the rest of the album follows along with a similar feel and style to the opener and is perhaps a good way to immerse oneself within the 'Nocturne' universe. 'Nocturne' consists of the instrumental 'Nocturne' which is more like a mix of atmospheric ambience with melodic guitar, delicate piano and drum fills accompanied by Johanna Nöstling's vocals, plus it also has the added elements of what sounds like samples of spoken language and vocal effects which adds another dimension to the piece.\n'Noise' comes next and it's an upbeat and catchy piece of progressive rock which has this heavy rhythm to it, the guitar is full of rich reverb which it's delivered with in a way that's quite hypnotic and the bass is deep and full of groove, while a heavy riff adds to this. There is a real sense of groove and attitude to the track with some great interplay between the keyboards and guitar and there is a wonderful feel of old school prog rock here mixed with some heavy riffing and an edginess to it, all of which makes for an enjoyable rock tune.\n'Nocturne' is back for another go and there's not a lot of difference between this and 'Nocturne' apart from it's slightly shorter in length by a matter of seconds; with 'Nocturne' however there is more instrumentation on display, including flute, synths and drums, which helps make the track a little fuller and more colourful overall. There's not a dramatic difference in style and tempo between both versions of the track, so that is the only real reason 'Nocturne' becomes redundant and thus doesn't really add much to the album.\n'Escape' is the first track on the album which has an almost dance or techno feel to it, though it's actually quite upbeat and not dark or depressing, more on a funkier side of things. 'Escape' has some good funky bass lines to it along with a rhythmic drum beat and a good electric guitar riff which also has a great sound to it. 'Escape' has a groovy feel to it, which is rather nice and this song along with 'Noise' are the heavier tunes on the album.\n'Out There' is the final track on the album, as on 'Out There' from the very outset the song just oozes with this relaxed feel to it, in particular with this laid back electric guitar which has this nice reverb effect to it. Again there's a great groove here and while this track has this nice laid back feel to it, there's not much progression or development, as 'Out There' is more of the same as the preceding tracks in that regard, still there is a sense of quality to the track itself which makes it a solid way to end this album. It's another short piece of music, coming to just three minutes in length, and in comparison with the rest of the tracks on the album it feels like a kind of 'outtake' or something added on after the main sessions ended, but all the other tracks are good enough that this isn't an issue as 'Out There' is still a good way to end the album.\nThe one thing that immediately stands out and comes to mind about the 'Nocturne' album is how this feels like the work of a band that is on the cusp of producing a full album without much in the way of changes, which also goes to say that this is more of an album in it's early stages of completion or something which has yet to be finished.\nDagon The Reef are a trio from Stockholm, Sweden, consisting of three talented musicians Erik Nösta...\nDagon's Reef have released a new track titled 'Waste Of Life' as a preview to their upcoming full-...\nFollowing from the success of his debut album 'The Unseen' back in 2014, singer-songwriter Tim Bric...\nNew from the underground of the music world is the debut album entitled 'The Unseen' from singer-s...\nThe debut album from Danish based duo The Hive Mind is a concept album of epic proportions, a so..."]], "filtered_resps": ["We are pleased to release this second album from Swedish psychedelic prog-rock outfit Dagon's Reef called 'Nocturne' this October 8th, a 10 track collection which has been three years in the making, as well as having a completely new line up, the only original member being guitarist and composer Erik Nilsson.

There are numerous factors that you must take into consideration when choosing a school, including the reputation and accreditation of the schools, the educational quality of the programs, and the preceptor experience of the teaching faculty. You may also want to talk to some students to get their opinions of the schools as well.\nThe first thing you need to do is to complete your research. This means that you need to spend time researching the different schools and the degree programs they offer. Make sure to find out what the focus of their programs is as well as what the overall reputation of the schools and programs are as well. You might even want to take a visit to one or two of the schools in person to see if you enjoy the campus culture and the way that the students are trained.\nYou may also want to speak to some of the instructors that they have on their staff. Educators who are in office long term can generally offer better insight and information about the courses and what each college focuses on. This helps you select a school that has the potential of being a good fit for your educational and career goals.\nYou should also make sure that the schools are accredited. Accreditation is one of the first steps of making sure you will receive the qualifications and degree that is best for you. There are many online options that you can consider when choosing to locate and complete an accredited program. Consider contacting the departments of education of any colleges you want to find out more about the educational requirements of your state.\nAfter you have narrowed down your schools based on their accreditation, reputation and other important factors, it is time to find a school that offers the type of practical training that will help you succeed in your field. There are several aspects of online and classroom training including core curriculum, computer requirements and the technical details that are associated with working in your chosen profession. You should look at which programs will help you meet all of these requirements before applying to schools.\nThere are many different career paths in the field of education. Depending on the type of program the student selects, there could be job related benefits in the field following graduation. When it comes to teachers and other positions in the classroom setting, you could gain more work experience to add to your resume. Some schools offer on-the-job training programs to help with certification or licensing. This type of training may also help with professional development for administrators and leaders.\nIt is common for school districts to offer bonuses, pay increases and other benefit packages to teachers. These benefits may offer financial assistance during professional development, student tuition assistance and scholarships, medical insurance, dental insurance and other health benefits if employees qualify. Teaching employment may also offer tuition reimbursement, a retirement plan and more.\nA number of schools are now starting to offer degrees online. This is a convenient way to learn as well as obtain a degree. This can allow you to work and school at the same time without having to move or go to evening classes. You can study on your own time as well as completing your assignments when you have free time and get your degree without having to disrupt your busy life schedule!\nStudents who work on their bachelor degrees generally earn more money than people who do not have a degree in education. In fact, when comparing wages across all jobs, teachers tend to earn more than the average amount of money.

There are numerous factors that you must take into consideration when choosing a school, including the reputation and accreditation of the schools, the educational quality of the programs, and the preceptor experience of the teaching faculty. You may also want to talk to some students to get their opinions of the schools as well.\nThe first thing you need to do is to complete your research. This means that you need to spend time researching the different schools and the degree programs they offer. Make sure to find out what the focus of their programs is as well as what the overall reputation of the schools and programs are as well. You might even want to take a visit to one or two of the schools in person to see if you enjoy the campus culture and the way that the students are trained.\nYou may also want to speak to some of the instructors that they have on their staff. Educators who are in office long term can generally offer better insight and information about the courses and what each college focuses on. This helps you select a school that has the potential of being a good fit for your educational and career goals.\nYou should also make sure that the schools are accredited. Accreditation is one of the first steps of making sure you will receive the qualifications and degree that is best for you.

Some schools offer on-the-job training programs to help with certification or licensing. This type of training may also help with professional development for administrators and leaders.\nIt is common for school districts to offer bonuses, pay increases and other benefit packages to teachers. These benefits may offer financial assistance during professional development, student tuition assistance and scholarships, medical insurance, dental insurance and other health benefits if employees qualify. Teaching employment may also offer tuition reimbursement, a retirement plan and more.\nA number of schools are now starting to offer degrees online. This is a convenient way to learn as well as obtain a degree. This can allow you to work and school at the same time without having to move or go to evening classes.

Does it exist? Is it some mystical entity that is the essence of everything, including the soul, or is it the very act of existing, the physical state that exists in our bodies?\nFor the sake of this article, let us assume that the term \"the spirit\" means all of the aforementioned things. Let's assume also that the spirit is the state that exists on an unmanifested plane (I'm not exactly sure where that plane exists, but I do know that a soul lives in its own space of consciousness, separate from the body. All of this can be read in the books, including The Secret of the Spirit and The Seven Spiritual Laws.\nNow, we can use this idea to explain many things. First, let's look at the notion of death. People who believe in reincarnation say that this state of being continues forever, while people of the belief that we have only one life have a concept of eternity. The concept of eternity is based upon a belief that there is something that exists beyond this mortal existence and is therefore an impossible state to achieve. So who is right? Well, here's an idea. If you believe in the spirit, and that the body is the materialization of the spirit, not the other way around, then it would follow that death is the final state of consciousness for the conscious entity, or \"soul\" as it's often referred to. It's no longer possible to experience a physical body, which is essentially what you have on Earth. But what happens when that physical body stops functioning? Well, it's only the physical body, but the spirit persists, as long as it is in this plane of existence. If you truly believe that the spirit is the essence of all things, and the spirit goes beyond the material plane, then it stands to reason that death is not the end, it's only a step backward. It's what makes the material body possible in the first place.\nAnd, it is in this state that we die, as it's the state of existence that is the most important, especially because it's the only way to go on in this world. It's not a question of how long a person lives, it's a question of what they did and what they became during their time here. That is the meaning of life, the meaning of the spirit.\nI realize that my theory is not entirely new, as others have theorized about the same idea, which is what makes it so easy to see it in a different light. The idea of death, while it's not entirely true, is based upon the idea that we will all eventually \"end,\" while we are still on this Earth. As our minds become evermore complex, we are able to create a \"spirit,\" because we become evermore conscious of our own existence.\nWith the creation of the soul, we are able to achieve a certain state of consciousness, as it is our brain that gives us this state, rather than our body or even our soul. This is why you feel such great pain or pleasure, because we all have that \"spirit,\" that \"soul\" as it's often referred to. This is the basis for everything, and as we gain more knowledge and experience, we gain additional information about ourselves, what we are and who we are, and thus we achieve a further understanding of who we truly are."]], "filtered_resps": ["This topic has been on my mind for quite some time, so here goes.\nSo what exactly is \"the spirit\"?

This novel follows two families and is interwoven with the story of a small town community where there are many secrets and lies. I thought this novel could almost be read as a romance, and yet it is also a historical novel. I would recommend this book to those who like a story that is well told that pulls on the narrative at different angles; I would recommend this book to readers who like a story with secrets and lies, and a story set during a time where there was change happening. I think that this novel is well written and it pulls on the reader's emotions. I feel that I am being told a story about a place and about human relationships. This novel also contains a number of historical facts that I was keen to find out about, such as; Native American history before the White Man arrived. The Gilded Hour is a novel to read and reread to uncover all of the history behind the story. There are a number of characters in this novel, and as well as the two families that we join for the most part in this novel, there are many more. These characters are quite diverse, and so each character can bring different emotions to the story. There are some interesting relationships in this novel, and these relationships are interesting to read about and to try to unravel. This novel also focuses on a family that has been affected by the loss of a child. I was not sure at the beginning of this novel exactly what was going to make this novel special for me, but it turned out that I was captured by the story of the town and by how the two families in this novel interacted.

When we understand it to be that way, our fear of being found guilty will be gone, our hope and love for him to be returned and our fear of death to be removed.\nWe will realize that He created us as “new creatures”, and that if we have repented, accepted Christ, obeyed the commandment to seek the Lord until He is found and repented in an act of true contrition (which many people think is to be as sincere as possible or to try harder), He has promised us “new hearts”, a clean slate, a full pardon, and complete freedom from all fears and regrets.\nWe will have a perfect relationship with God in heaven with the opportunity to ask Him for anything we have forgotten or thought we could never ask Him to do.\nOne little story about Mary will show you what the Lord thinks of her.\nHe also does not accept those to Heaven who are guilty of the sin against the Holy Ghost, although this sin is the one that many are afraid to even mention, and very few understand.\nThis is about the most shocking revelation I have seen in a while. I have looked for evidence to support and confirm this, and have found it. It is the only thing that makes sense for several reason that I will tell you as we go. I say that because if the Lord does not forgive the sin of blasphemy against the Holy Ghost, neither of us will make it to heaven.\nIf we understand the sin of blasphemy against the Holy Ghost, we will better understand why Mary is given special attention in this revelation.\nWhen you are in love, you will do what you have to do to please your beloved. You try very hard to be very honest with him or her. You never tell him or her anything you do not mean but you sometimes do tell them, “I told you so”, and “if only you had seen it my way”, or you feel you will “spare the rod” and cause them to see the error of their ways.\nThe devil will try to get you to do the same with God, but he will not succeed.\nYou would think it could as the people in this book do, but in this chapter we will see that it is not.\nWhat does it mean to you to believe He is real? Does it mean to you that you should give Him more attention? Does it mean that you should go to church as you once did? Does it mean that you should pray and read the Bible more? Does it make you a better person?\nDo you believe that He really can help you in your life on earth, or was that just some talk? Do you really believe He can and will help you in the future, or is just something the church told you?\nIf you have done a lot of things for Him, were they really to please Him, and if not will it help to please Him for you to stop doing them?\nThe sin of blasphemy against the Holy Ghost is a very common sin, but we must understand what it really is.\nThis is about the Lord’s feelings toward it, the reason He can not forgive this sin, and about the things this will bring about.\nDo we not see how Mary is honored? She was the only one able to know the truth. Do we see how all those years she spent, in the quietness of prayer, without seeing any of what the Lord did in her day, she saw God’s love for her and his mercy and gave thanks for that love.\nDid we not see how that great prayer must have brought joy and peace to Her Soul? Did we not see how the Love of God was so strong in Mary that she did not see sin, but instead saw a love with which she could never be satisfied save in the service of her beloved?\nDid we not see all that love as the greatest gift that God could give her, yet she did not give it to Him?\nShe did not trust Him to come to her. She did not go to the Lord when He came. She could not even say “I am the servant of the Lord”.\nIt seems, like, the greatest gift of all is lost on us, when we could have the greatest gift in the world; if we only knew the gift was lost on us.\nDo we then see the purpose of the Lord’s Love in the matter? He wanted a Mother who trusted Him totally in the future. He also wanted her to live up to that love, but He did not wish her to give it away to a false religion.\nThe Love of the Lord is so great He could even forgive those who took from her the gift she was to give back to Him, if they repented of taking from her the gift He wanted to give her.\nThe same love is felt by Her Son, as he gives it back to Her in His Sacrifice upon the Cross. This gift, He would like to give it to Mary, but for the sake of the salvation of the world, He can not.\nWhy did he lose that love? Was it because he had no faith in the love he had, or because of his disobedience, which he knew was the one thing he truly loved?\nDid he not see that if he had faith in that love He would not do that? Did he not see that he was the one to take that thing away from Mary, and thus lost it all?\nHe was lost because He could no longer trust God to be true, to keep Mary safe forever, and to protect her from all harm when the time came. He had learned to hate God and to know His sin, but that did He know to be any less than God knew of sin.\nAnd why was this? Because if sin has power, so does the love of God, and the power is not in the sin itself, but in the love which is at war with sin.\nThe purpose of the Lord’s love in keeping Mary on earth in her own home, and in helping her to be faithful to the sacrifice she made, is so that He would have the honor of giving her back the gift He had once loved when she was born.\nWas He to be proud and to love her with a love He had loved in the past?\nWhy did He lose that love?\nHis obedience was disobedience; His faithlessness was faithfulness. He could not give himself with the love He loved.\nTherefore, if the Son of God has lost His love, what then shall we call this loss? We must understand it as He did.\nIf the son does not have the love of his father he is a disloyal and ungrateful servant, but when the son loses his love he becomes a traitor or rebel, who will leave you to the service of God, in exchange for the service of Satan, as the Lord did all who forsake Him and all who were lost and lost forever.\nWe have a new chance to understand what the Lord meant when He said, “I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life”. This is really a new and a bigger revelation about life and the Lord.\nThe Lord has told us His Love is not about the future, but about the past, the present, and the future.\nHis Love is for those who came to Him before they were, because when He told us our life could end in the future, it could also be a beginning."]], "filtered_resps": ["The first two of these posts are long and I wanted you to be able to read them.\nThese last two are shorter and I think you will gain a few very interesting thoughts.\nMy purpose in writing them is to help you see and experience that God’s mercy is infinite.

I have tried the following things and none have worked, so forgive me if I am missing/forgetting something.

However, knowledge is generated and utilized via a complex interaction of the knowledge generation process, knowledge sharing, knowledge creation and acquisition, knowledge storage and retrieval, and exploitation.\nThe role of technology in knowledge-based companies is a critical component in achieving a competitive advantage through knowledge creation. Knowledge management needs to be implemented, monitored and managed continuously in order for the company to be able to adapt to the dynamics of the marketplace. The organization needs to change in ways to deal with the complexity of creating and exploiting knowledge.

The injury may result from a build-up of lactic acid in the muscle tissues, so a warm shower or a hot bath (just don’t have a hot bath after a run!) will help to loosen the muscles.

He was a medical doctor at an infectious disease institute (which is great) but if I recall correctly he had a PhD in Public Health. This is a completely different discipline and I don’t even think he had any formal training in epidemiology which is the study of how diseases are spread (throughout his career his role has been more political, although in the current environment that may be about to change). \n\nThere is also a really important question which has recently come up about Tedros receiving a pay rise of almost 200K USD.

How will they change the patient’s experience? How will they transform the provider’s experience? Which technology is best-suited for healthcare organizations? How can the industry keep up with these changes?\nWe recently sat down with James Vlasblom, the leader of IBM’s Healthcare & Life Sciences strategy and thought leadership, to discuss these questions and some of the top trends that will reshape the healthcare industry in 2018.\nQ: What are big challenges for companies operating in the healthcare industry?\nA: The healthcare industry continues to undergo transformations, specifically due to the technological improvements.\nI see the healthcare industry is a highly competitive industry to be in at the moment. We’re seeing major players moving into the industry. And even in the past half a year, you’ve seen major players moving into the industry. We’re seeing the major payers like CVS, Walmart, and Amazon move into healthcare with their own solutions to take on the existing players.\nWe’re also seeing technology players such as Google, Apple, and Microsoft move their technologies to healthcare. We are witnessing the digital transformation. Digital transformation is a big trend. What we’re seeing with these companies is their focus on cloud transformation and big data analytics. This can be used to analyze large volumes of data to drive the digital transformation agenda.\nIt’s imperative for healthcare providers and organizations to understand the new emerging technologies and to start applying them for better services.\nQ: How can a service provider’s digital maturity impact the industry?\nA: Service providers need to evaluate the current capability set. They need to check where they are currently positioned. Digital maturity is a crucial element of transformation. It’s about your capabilities around delivering services from a customer perspective. Providers can deliver the services by leveraging the digital technologies. They can also enhance their current capabilities in the digital space to achieve better outcomes for the people and organizations.\nQ: What are the new trends that will transform the healthcare industry in 2018?\nA: There are three main trends for healthcare this year. The first one is about personalization, where you can personalize your experience. We are now at a point where you can customize healthcare. You can personalize it by location, by the provider, by your location, and how you are using the solutions. Providers and providers can give better services to their customers based on their location and how they want to take care of their healthcare needs.\nThe second trend is around predictive analytics and insights. This is about driving and improving the predictive and prescriptive model. Organizations can use the data that’s being collected from providers for patient data, for patients and providers, into healthcare. It will allow them to analyze the data to drive the insights and use to improve their patient-centric model.\nThe next one is around cognitive computing. Cognitive computing is about using artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and robotics to analyze data and drive insights.\nQ: Which technology is best-suited for healthcare organizations?\nA: I believe, in the healthcare world, there’s a need to integrate technologies across clinical systems, back-office systems, and business processes. One of the technologies that will help transform healthcare is artificial intelligence (AI). AI is based on human intelligence and can interact with other humans in different ways. AI can be applied in almost all the major areas in the healthcare industry. It’s particularly important for the service industry, for example, by understanding your business requirements and optimizing the outcomes.\nIn healthcare, there’s a lot of data analysis to be done to understand the needs of patients and providers. We can use these tools to understand the needs and to make predictions based on the information provided.\nAnother technology, for example, is the IBM Watson Health, which applies the science of AI to drive the decisions. The decision has to be made in real time to provide the information to healthcare providers. We can use AI to analyze the data to identify patterns. You can identify the patterns based on the information provided and make predictions.\nIBM provides the technology for a lot of healthcare solutions. We provide tools, analytics, and capabilities needed for healthcare providers to make better decisions. The next step is how we can extend these technologies to improve the patient experience.\nQ: How can the industry keep up with these changes?\nA: Healthcare providers and organizations need to take advantage of the new emerging technologies. Providers need to invest in the emerging technologies. They need to focus on their own digital transformations by improving the digital capabilities in the current transformation to take on the big players.\nThe industry should keep up by investing in different technologies to stay relevant and to provide innovative solutions to the healthcare industry. By investing in technology solutions, healthcare industry can improve the quality of services provided to patients and drive better outcomes.\nThe healthcare industry in the US is the largest employer of all occupations in the country. In fact, it employs almost 20% of the total employees in the country.\nWith healthcare industry being one of the fastest growing industries, it is important that a healthcare organization knows very well what factors are driving its success and failure.\nAnd, if it is taking advantage of new innovative technology solutions, it is a bonus."]], "filtered_resps": ["What are the new trends that will transform the global healthcare industry in the near future?

Many of us know Bill as a dedicated member of the WMC and MCM community, working for an important part of the community. It is very important to understand the role of this person. Read on.\nThe purpose of this document is to share my observations, experiences and knowledge of our industry so that all participants may take advantage of the opportunities presented by our growing industry.\nMy name is Bill Zeban. I have been in the automotive industry for over 20 years. I have owned two dealerships, been a manufacturer district sales manager with Ford Motor Company and have spent the last 7 years as the CEO and President of the World Motorsport Council, a professional membership and certification division of SEMA. This organization was established to give an alternative for car dealers and other individuals involved in the automotive aftermarket to show their professionalism in business and technical competency. In the past, the aftermarket focused on the manufacturer’s certification, which was a good idea but it did not allow for the participation of independent shops. We are a non stock or member based association. Certification is not only good reputation marketing but also provides a base to expand our industry.\nThere are some misconceptions that seem to arise regularly about SEMA, the aftermarket and other related organizations and industries. I will share my insight and expertise on how the aftermarket functions in hopes of clarifying some of these issues.\nOver the last several years, SEMA has grown at a much faster pace than the rest of the aftermarket. The automotive aftermarket is a $20 billion industry. SEMA is a relatively small part of that but it provides many benefits to our segment. In 2007, over 75 percent of SEMA revenue came from auto parts and service. The remainder of revenue is derived from product development and licensing. Approximately 75 percent of manufacturers that are represented at SEMA use this organization for research to improve their products and services to dealers. We also provide dealer education services, and we work on legislation that benefits our members and the aftermarket as a whole.\nMany people are afraid that SEMA will only benefit large auto service operations, but the aftermarket in general represents smaller businesses than you may think. The average size of a SEMA dealer is two cars. This means that almost a million shops are represented in our member and certified member base. So the majority of people that you see at SEMA are not the big giants that you may anticipate and they are a huge portion of our society. Some are so small that they are not even listed in the Dealer Locator.\nAnother misconception is that most people that are involved in the SEMA show are members. In fact, most members do not visit or display at this show. Many members, especially the larger manufacturers, have found different means of reaching customers and dealers during the year with promotions and dealer meetings. However there is a significant portion that attend the show to see what is new, talk with competitors and suppliers and take advantage of the networking opportunities. Dealers and other independent shops that are members of SEMA find that this show is very effective for their businesses. By attending the show, they are able to reach more dealers and customers than they would have reached by taking a traditional trip to Las Vegas.\nMany of the manufacturers that sell to the aftermarket are at SEMA on a regular basis. This group is the majority of the members in SEMA and it includes several large manufacturers of automotive parts, tools, accessories and equipment. The manufacturers have the majority of their employees at SEMA because it is a highly productive time for them, providing opportunities to view our members’ cars, make purchases and learn about marketing services for their business. The manufacturers also use the show to meet with their independent sales managers, dealers and their own distributor network all under one roof. It is hard to explain the value of this event to an outsider.\nWe are not just an industry organization; we are an industry event. As I said before, the aftermarket is a $20 billion industry. Many of the major companies in this business find it difficult to attend a single show that reaches that amount in revenue. There are several multi day events that our industry attends in Las Vegas. Our members that are also manufacturers also set up trade exhibits that cover a much smaller area. In fact, most of their exhibits are just outside the entrance of the SEMA show and are just as effective as having them in the SEMA show floor. If a manufacturer cannot use one of their representatives to attend SEMA, they have the option to send a car and a banner that has their name on it. These display methods save them money and allow for the participation of many more people than they could hire for an entire show.\nSEMA also hosts many side events to entertain people who are not manufacturers and to keep them busy during these events. One of the most popular events is the annual SEMA Show Auto Corral, which features car shows on Friday evening and all day Saturday. On Friday night the Show Auto Corral features special shows open just to members of the automotive industry. Most of the members at this show are also members of SEMA. The show features special car shows for manufacturers, manufacturers specials for independent car care show and SEMA Show Cars. This is also a very popular event that does not have a cost to attend and the entry fees are low.\nOther events include the SEMA Cares Charity Classic held at the SEMA Show in Las Vegas in conjunction with a car auction. Since its inception in 2004, the Cares Charity Classic has raised an astounding over $8 million for charities.\nThe SEMA Show is very intense for us. We do our best to protect the interests of our members at our events by putting in place strict codes of conduct to regulate behavior at our events. We are very serious in this matter. SEMA has provided special training to our members and employees so that these issues are taken seriously.\nSEMA, like many other organizations, is comprised of many different personalities from a wide range of backgrounds and professions. As in any group, you will have some folks that will not represent your best interests. The best example of this is a small but vocal group of people that attempt to use the association to gain favor. SEMA does not and will always have a reputation of protecting the interests of its members. This is our primary responsibility to the aftermarket.\nWe must realize that if some people would stop playing games and were more concerned with the value of the organization we would find we had the support of a lot more people.\nThere are other organizations that represent the aftermarket with the same professional standards that SEMA does. The major automotive association (AMA) does not serve the after market as a whole and has more of an auto parts focus, not just automotive performance parts.\nSince 2003, I have worked with the AMA in an effort to become more involved. The AMA and I have had three meetings in the last year that I know of and they seem very concerned with their members. At our first meeting, our association was being reviewed by the AMA to see if we would be qualified to become a member. At the second meeting, there was still not a clear answer and the AMA made some changes to their code requirements for membership. To say that a code of ethics does not work or is not necessary is not the case with SEMA. We have to constantly be on guard to keep the right kind of people from joining our organization.\nSince my meeting with the AMA board, I have continued to see a lack of understanding of the difference between SEMA and the AMA and that SEMA provides a better quality membership and a level of service that the AMA cannot provide. There have been several recent instances where AMA members have approached us about membership issues. It is very discouraging for SEMA to see how some people are misrepresenting our association to members. It also makes you aware of those that don’t understand what a level of commitment it takes for our association to be successful.\nIt is easy for someone to tell you what is good about an organization in one sentence. After that, things go downhill. For that reason, I decided to go into detail about what we do and why we do it, so you may see how much work goes into our association.\nWe do not have the time or the resources to respond to questions for every company that has a problem or just needs to talk. We can only take care of the requests that are submitted to us through our website. We have received several calls and written letters from companies outside our organization. I have never seen a website or association that has as much information as ours, but there is no reason to have access to our member or dealer service data or to ask us questions. The most important reason is that we are a professional membership association and we take very seriously the responsibilities of preserving our reputation.\nI feel that you are not only the first point of contact for a company that has any issue with SEMA. You act as the main communicator with the company for that company and can answer a lot of the questions that are asked of us. As the first point of contact, you seem to see our organization through a different lens. All it takes is a few positive or negative responses to start making a name for your service or your company. I know this because I have seen it happen on several occasions and that also happens all the time on the Internet and when I go on the SEMA website!\nOur website is always being upgraded and we have added a members’ area where everyone can update or add to their existing content. We have added a page that is updated by the AMA to show the code of ethics which has been passed on by the association. The code of ethics is only something that AMA members should be concerned with, and we are still waiting to see who the next group"]], "filtered_resps": ["I have received the following article from Bill Zeban, who has passed it to me to share with the rest of you.

My friend did go down there to get those stickers etc. He went to the roof and there was no stickers for sale, but if you look at the roof there are a few spots you will see the roof is sloped, and has no tiles.\nI saw a few guys going to the roof. So, I went. I figured it would be the same thing. So I don't know if you got it but there was only stickers. No shirts. And all the others were just regular pictures. I think that place is pretty cool tho.\nI thought that was the same place they're in the video with the stickers... They did like a live stream of them all going there and I saw a lot of people. I dont know if that was the main sticker place and they put some on there, but I wasnt impressed by the number that was there.\nI know of a lot of people that went to the show in the last couple months and found stickers while they were there.\nYup, I went a little while ago and got one of those. Heh.\nWell, there are these cool stickers around here, and they are cool, the only problem is that the sticker has its own label, you can't tell what it is. So I went to the store which had the sticker, and found some stickers of these stickers, and they have a label, and I'm sure you will see a lot of people wearing them.\nI see that in their store."], "doc_hash": "45e3c16e2afcebba5bad6d617efcfd4260f74a2bcf0312b9bf9fa032f8dc294a", "prompt_hash": "3d0c1cf596181258a003e9f95c836c765d44353532e67c70d7dff48b05f64840", "target_hash": "e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855", "bypass": null}

However, there are numerous soft skills that can be learned as well. To better your chances of securing the position of your choice, you should acquire these skills.\nThese skills are important for a job seeker’s success. These skills not only help you stand out from the crowd. Even if you are seeking a job where your work experience is all that is required, soft skills can prove to be just as important as technical skills.\nIf you’re not sure how to improve your soft skills, you may need to get some outside help. Our team at Cielo has the expertise and experience to assist you in improving your soft skills and, as a result, your chances of landing that perfect job.\nHard Skills – Hard skills refer to any skills relevant to the job you are applying for, ranging from programming languages to accounting principles. Since it is easier to teach individuals hard skills, they are more useful than soft skills.\nSoft Skills – These are attributes that are more difficult to teach. They refer to how you conduct yourself in your daily interpersonal interactions in a variety of settings. These skills are difficult to quantify and evaluate, but having them will set you apart as an employee. Soft skills are extremely beneficial to job applicants since they help to improve the candidate’s ability to interact positively with employees and management, and are valued by corporate leaders in a wide range of industries, both in the United States and abroad.\nInterpersonal Skills: These skills can be acquired through training and are useful in any workplace. They are essential for teamwork, as they help to establish trust in one’s ability to interact with coworkers and clients. The most difficult skills to learn are communication skills, such as active listening skills, or how to interact with other team members in an interpersonal or group setting. In fact, active listening skill is very difficult. You must be able to hear other people and truly understand what they have to say in order to truly listen effectively.\nA critical component of interpersonal skills is the ability to communicate clearly. It is difficult to have a conversation with other people without communicating effectively. The ability to effectively resolve conflicts is essential for any job position or organization. It can be difficult to stay calm and avoid getting agitated in the most difficult situations, but it is necessary. Having good communication skills can help you resolve conflicts in a manner that is both productive and efficient.\nOther interpersonal skills that can be developed include the ability to motivate others, to effectively delegate tasks, and to work well as part of a team or leader. Motivation is a characteristic that sets you apart. It will determine the outcome of any project that you are assigned. Because motivation is so easy to acquire, it is often ignored by students and employees. It is important to understand that motivation can be learned, but it should be nurtured in order to achieve the highest possible results.\nDelegation skills are another critical skill. Delegation is the act of assigning tasks to someone else in order to free up your time for more important activities. One of the most common mistakes that are made in the workplace is that one employee will assign too many tasks or assignments but won’t follow through on what has been assigned. If one person becomes too involved in the assignment, it can make the whole team sluggish and unproductive. Other employees may not even understand what has been assigned to them, so there is no point in trying to implement new ideas. It is easy for one person or group to take over another’s workload, and it can cause resentment and a decreased level of trust between workers.\nTeamwork skills can come into play when a project requires more than one person. Because each individual has their own strengths and weaknesses, it is important to assign tasks based on what the team needs to accomplish. This is why it is important to train yourself and your employees how to work together as a team. When a team is organized and operates smoothly, productivity is increased and there are fewer employee turnovers. This means a better workplace for everyone.\nThe importance of customer service skills cannot be overestimated. A good customer service team is instrumental in the success of any business. In fact, it is necessary for the success of any organization in any service or business. Having good customer service skills can help you to effectively deal with customers, keep the customer happy and make sure that the product or service provided meets customer expectations.\nA customer service employee must be able to identify problems, make suggestions, and resolve issues quickly. This is done by asking the customer about his or her needs and expectations, then making suggestions and using resources to make sure that the product or service is delivered on time. Customer service representatives can do a large amount of research on their own, so they are highly valued. In addition, customer service representatives often receive recognition and promotions.\nAs you can see, soft skills are just as important as technical skills when it comes to finding and keeping a job. You will not only stand out from the crowd by showing off your communication skills, but you will impress other employees and leaders.\nIf you’re unsure about how to improve your soft skills and strengthen them, you’re in luck!

The proposal, announced by Europe’s Finance Ministers, has sparked a wave of reactions from industry stakeholders and policymakers alike, who’ve questioned the proposed move, its implications and the overall effect the regulatory scheme could have on crypto and Web3 ecosystems.\nThe proposed rules could have dramatic consequences for the crypto industry in Europe, making compliance to regulations a necessity to operate within the continent, requiring crypto services companies to adopt Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) protocols such as those introduced by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) recommendations, to comply with local laws.\nCrypto businesses must be able to maintain KYC and AML records and, due to their nature, they are often seen as inherently risky for money laundering, which can lead to the disruption of the entire business, and therefore, the overall development of the European crypto space.\nAlthough European authorities aren’t particularly welcoming to crypto, crypto-friendly nations like Malta and Switzerland are taking the lead in this industry, introducing laws to support the crypto community and boost digital assets’ adoption, while the UK appears to be lagging behind.\nAmidst growing regulatory pressure, European crypto businesses may look towards offshore jurisdictions that are less stringent when it comes to cryptocurrency regulation. For startups specifically, being able to operate freely or with very loose restrictions is what they value most, which is why jurisdictions such as Malta, Costa Rica, Singapore, Malta, Panama, and Switzerland attract a huge number of crypto projects every year.\nWhat exactly is the FATF, and, most importantly, who is impacted by this new regulatory framework?\nFATF, short for Financial Action Task Force, is a global regulatory body that sets standards to combat money laundering and other financial crimes.\nIn the crypto industry, the FATF has two main guidelines, one set of standards aimed at traditional financial institutions, and another, the Travel Rule standard, which regulates how crypto companies must comply with its guidelines or face heavy fine penalties.\nIn an effort to combat money laundering, FATF requires traditional financial institutions and crypto companies to maintain KYC, identify their users, and report suspicious transactions which could be related to money laundering or other fraudulent activities.\nHowever, FATF also requires traditional financial institutions to adhere to “travel” rules, which specify that “services providers must identify and share information about the payer of money and the beneficiary of money or virtual currency” when a transactional service like a wire transfer or a credit card payment occurs.\nThe implication of the FATF travel rule standard was that crypto was, for the first time, recognized as a means of payments, and as a result, as a target for AML/CTF purposes. As such, crypto-to-crypto transactions, and transfers from digital wallets, were now a target for AML/CTF verification, despite the fact that crypto is often used by people in countries with high numbers of unregulated or illegal financial activities, which have high risk levels for money laundering.\nRegulators in different jurisdictions may interpret the FATF standards in different ways, putting their national policies in conflict with international regulations, which is exactly what happened at the time with the EU, who tried to implement the FATF standards while they were still in progress and lacking any concrete definition.\nIn 2020, despite the continued lack of clarity regarding how to apply the FATF standards on crypto transactions, the EU took a step forward and adopted a proposal for a “market standard” that set a minimum level for AML/CTF regulation, in anticipation of more clarity from FATF.\nThe draft law, although aimed at all banks and financial institutions, can be interpreted by regulators as an attempt to apply regulations on crypto operators in the EU. The draft law would prohibit all digital asset service firms from accessing the European financial sector and operate within the EU without a license or a “PassPorting” mechanism. PassPorting is a regulatory mechanism that allows European authorized institutions the ability to provide services in another EU country. It is commonly used by financial institutions in the crypto space as a way to bypass regulations in other jurisdictions.\nHowever, the fact that crypto businesses are not currently required to follow AML/CTF policies already in place in many jurisdictions puts crypto at a disadvantage when compared to traditional financial institutions operating in the same jurisdiction. Therefore regulators may view the crypto sector too risky for AML/CTF compliance if they are operating independently.\nThe EU proposal has been met with significant backlash by the crypto industry.\nAmong the main criticisms of the proposal is that the EU’s current draft law lacks clarity.\nThe vagueness of the proposal makes it difficult for crypto businesses to gauge what policies they must follow, and whether they can benefit from the same regulatory systems used by traditional financial institutions.\nThe lack of clarity also makes it difficult for EU authorities to understand what cryptocurrency businesses can offer, and, therefore, how their financial assets can be properly regulated, which is also why crypto companies are now looking elsewhere for opportunities in less onerous jurisdictions.\nIf the current proposal is approved by the European Parliament, which has yet to be approved, crypto companies operating in the EU face heavy obstacles and potential disruption of their businesses.\nFor crypto businesses operating in the EU, complying with AML/CTF policies and the European market standards is mandatory if they want to stay operational in the EU, or access EU financial markets for both fiat and crypto services.\nThere are numerous crypto service providers operating in Germany, but there are other countries with more lenient crypto regulations, such as Austria, Malta, Switzerland, and even Singapore whose stringent compliance policies will attract more crypto companies in the future.\nIt’s clear that the crypto industry needs to be regulated, but how the regulations are applied, and the actual implications could mean the difference between a thriving business and the complete cessation of operations."]], "filtered_resps": ["In December, the European Commission announced its plans to propose new legislation that would regulate crypto-assets under the same terms as conventional financial services and products.

PassPorting is a regulatory mechanism that allows European authorized institutions the ability to provide services in another EU country. It is commonly used by financial institutions in the crypto space as a way to bypass regulations in other jurisdictions.\nHowever, the fact that crypto businesses are not currently required to follow AML/CTF policies already in place in many jurisdictions puts crypto at a disadvantage when compared to traditional financial institutions operating in the same jurisdiction. Therefore regulators may view the crypto sector too risky for AML/CTF compliance if they are operating independently.\nThe EU proposal has been met with significant backlash by the crypto industry.\nAmong the main criticisms of the proposal is that the EU’s current draft law lacks clarity.\nThe vagueness of the proposal makes it difficult for crypto businesses to gauge what policies they must follow, and whether they can benefit from the same regulatory systems used by traditional financial institutions.\nThe lack of clarity also makes it difficult for EU authorities to understand what cryptocurrency businesses can offer, and, therefore, how their financial assets can be properly regulated, which is also why crypto companies are now looking elsewhere for opportunities in less onerous jurisdictions.\nIf the current proposal is approved by the European Parliament, which has yet to be approved, crypto companies operating in the EU face heavy obstacles and potential disruption of their businesses.\nFor crypto businesses operating in the EU, complying with AML/CTF policies and the European market standards is mandatory if they want to stay operational in the EU, or access EU financial markets for both fiat and crypto services.\nThere are numerous crypto service providers operating in Germany, but there are other countries with more lenient crypto regulations, such as Austria, Malta, Switzerland, and even Singapore whose stringent compliance policies will attract more crypto companies in the future.\nIt’s clear that the crypto industry needs to be regulated, but how the regulations are applied, and the actual implications could mean the difference between a thriving business and the complete cessation of operations."], "doc_hash": "45e3c16e2afcebba5bad6d617efcfd4260f74a2bcf0312b9bf9fa032f8dc294a", "prompt_hash": "3d0c1cf596181258a003e9f95c836c765d44353532e67c70d7dff48b05f64840", "target_hash": "e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855", "bypass": null}

Writing advice often takes the form of \"do this, not that.\" So, what are some examples of telling?\n\nI think, by telling, I mean information that the character would know, if they happened to be sharing their thoughts. I think of it as information that isn't obvious to the reader, but is obvious to the character.\n\nI don't understand why we have rules against telling, though. Telling, I can see, is very different from showing. It's easy to demonstrate that the character knows the information. But what's actually so wrong with telling that we must be warned against it? And also, is all telling automatically bad?\n\nI understand that often times saying a thing is not as interesting to a reader as showing it. A character doing something, and it resulting in some consequence or other can be more interesting for a reader, than sitting through the character saying a thing and it being just as obvious to the reader. And I know of times, myself, when I've used information my characters are aware of, in order to move the plot forward, instead of showing them doing something.\n\nBut then, I often ask myself if, for the sake of moving things forward, it isn't better to use showing. That is, showing instead of telling or using a different device to describe it (e.g. showing through dialogue, or using a character to repeat the words, even though the character is already aware of it.) I'll ask myself if it isn't better to tell a thing once or twice so I can get it done, instead of using a device, or even better, putting it as dialogue - for which the character would say it. Or would it be better to just use the device or character, so I don't bother anyone with so much telling?\n\nMy thought on things is that sometimes, the rules against telling are just that - some people making rules. And, the rules aren't something you must follow in every case. So, when I see someone saying the story is told instead of shown, I do wonder if the person might be overdoing it - to the extent that telling does become boring.\n\nAs a counter-point, I am a little afraid of writing things in the style of some writers I admire. They don't tend to use many devices to show events, but instead use the simple, matter-of-fact way they tell things. For instance, one I really like, Steven Erikson, will just go ahead and describe something, without putting any filter in front of it. In contrast, say, I might be hesitant to say something like: \"Djall took his axe out of the hole he had burned in the floor, and threw it into the flames.\" I realize the person knows what just happened, but I wonder - can I express the information I want to convey, in another way that isn't so telling?\n\nAgain, here I want to address the caveats I mentioned earlier. In this post, I do realize that sometimes the rules against doing certain things are there for good reason. That sometimes, even though two people might know the same thing, one person might choose to tell it to another, and for good reason. And yes, sometimes, one might even choose to tell someone they are telling them something, rather than to show them.\n\nMaybe, in contrast to what I often read, for good reason, people do choose telling over showing or another device in order to move things along. I'm not saying they don't have a reason. It's just, I wonder if they are doing it too often, or too strongly.\n\nI know telling has both its bad points, and when you know it can be bad, it is often a good idea either to avoid telling, or do it sparingly. But that is all. In this post, I just want to have discussion. Do any of you think, or know, what makes telling bad?

At the same time, the company is also expanding its range to include new plug-in hybrid models.\nTwo years ago, Porsche and Volkswagen Group subsidiary Cupra announced a partnership to develop plug-in hybrid versions of upcoming models from the Porsche sports car manufacturer. Now Cupra has announced the brand’s first all-electric model from the middle of next year: an SUV called Formentor.\nThe Cupra model is positioned as an alternative to the Tesla Model Y and will be built in a newly built factory in Martorell, Spain for Cupra and the Volkswagen Group. Cupra will also offer performance vehicles based on the Porsche Panamera and Taycan in future.\nBut it is the Porsche segment that is also likely to be one of the most promising and fastest growing parts of the business in future. With the 918 Spyder and Taycan, the sports car manufacturer has already implemented a very successful start to electric propulsion to date.\nThe electrification of the range is now being continued: after the Taycan – which is available with various output levels – the company wants to follow the Panamera and Macan with plug-in hybrid models at the end of 2020. The Cayenne and 992 generation Turbo should of course also receive a plug-in hybrid version.\nThe Porsche Panamera and Cayenne plug-in hybrid models are said to offer a range of electric driving of more than 100 kilometres. The top-of-the-range Panamera Turbo S E-Hybrid will be equipped with a petrol engine from the V8 family, as well as a large high-capacity battery.\nThese should enable a driving range of 600 kilometers, and the maximum output of 600 hp should be a bit above the Panamera 4 in terms of performance. These are the figures that you are currently not used to with Porsche models.\nAlso interesting: how dangerous is the Chinese CoroVirus for us?\nWhile the Panamera has lost some of its sporting flair, the new Cayenne will appear as a more athletic model with significantly tighter proportions. The all-electric e-Taycan has been on the US market since summer 2020.\nR&D: how dangerous is the Chinese CoroVirus for us?\nThe Taycan’s range is just under 480 km, which is around twice as long as the Tesla Model S’s range and more than 40 percent longer than the next model in the premium electric segment, the Audi E-Tron. It also has the advantage of quick refueling times: according to the WLTP certification criteria, the Taycan takes around half an hour for a recharge to 80 percent. The E-Tron, with a 90 kWh battery, reaches the same level after an hour.\nPorsche expects to launch more than 100 electrified models by 2025, while by 2030 its annual sales of electrified and battery-powered vehicles should reach one billion. But the company also wants to remain flexible – the 911, for example, can still be purchased with a gasoline engine.\nThe sports car manufacturer does not want to be a player in the electric car market in the coming years. That is why Porsche wants to be more flexible by combining electric propulsion with combustion engine technology. The future model for everyday use thus becomes a hybrid.\nWhile the Porsche Cayenne has been the model for electric drive for a long time, the 911 and Macan have to wait a little longer. When production of the mid-engined sports car, which was recently named the world’s most beautiful sports car for the ninth time, will finally move from Zuffenhausen to Leipzig, Porsche is said to have decided on an additional plug-in hybrid variant.\nThis top-of-the-line variant would be the first electrified variant of the 911 as well, which is why the future model range would also receive a plug-in hybrid variant for the first time. For the first time at the beginning of the next decade, Porsche is therefore considering a vehicle that combines an electric propulsion system with a combustion engine.\nEven though the 911 is not exactly a newcomer to the scene, the car manufacturer must continue with the model. The 911 as the sporty flagship of the brand also represents Porsche’s commitment to its own technology platform. There is also the intention of expanding the range by plug-in hybrids, which are also to be deployed under the label 992.\nThe first information about the Cayman models for the next generation have already been announced: The front is said to be more upright than today and therefore also sportier, while the rear could benefit from a less aggressive character line.\nAt the same time, the next-generation 718 Boxster is already in the starting blocks. This model will also receive an electrically assisted mid-engine hybrid system, with a drive concept based on the Taycan and the Panamera Sports Turismo. These will be the first two plug-in hybrid sports cars of this type from Porsche. The mid-range sports car, for example, comes on the market from 2020 under the names 718 and 728.\nIn both models, the new 48-volt starter-generator should increase the maximum torque by 20 percent and increase the fuel efficiency by 15 percent. The electric sports car e-Boxter concept, presented at the 2013 Geneva Motor Show on a concept of the Cayman S, is also still at the stage of planning. One of the biggest challenges for the electric sports car is an impressive range. As the Taycan shows, a real 300 km range is no problem. With the Taycan, Porsche has succeeded in equipping the first sporty electric car with a range large enough to take over the daily trip without problems.\nWhat was missing in the electric car world at first was a second model that could actually come close to Porsche brand quality. But now two vehicles are coming from Porsche. It is still early to say how successful the products will be, but it is evident that Porsche is on the cutting edge of technology in the car market and intends to take a big step forward with the Taycan.\nThe company would not have introduced the Taycan if it hadn’t been a top-class product with all the technical details – such as charging, for example. Of course, the company is also not losing its independence in product development.

They didn't really care about truth in the least; they were driven by a passion to persecute and even kill Him.\nThen we move to those who didn't have an immediate problem with Him. They appreciated Him for what He was – and so they made the effort to come and actually listen to Him. At first, that was all they did – listen – before they dismissed Him. But they were willing to make the effort, and so they went on to do more.\nThat's where we are at this point in Mark. \"But He moved on through more cities and villages... until He reached his destination.\" If you recall, Jesus went to Jerusalem to start His public ministry where He went about carrying out the mission God had given His Son. When He got to Jordan, He was baptized by John who prepared Him to minister. Now He has gone throughout Galilee – He hasn't even spent a lot of time in Jerusalem – and they're continuing to listen... but they're continuing to be confused by just what they're hearing.\nI am convinced that Jesus didn't have any problem talking with those who were simply curious. His problem was with those who did not want to hear; who had a different agenda; who were driven by an agenda to see Christ crucified again – as they viewed it.\nI do not know how many will see this sermon series as relevant today since we are in the midst of the coronavirus and social distancing. I have no idea how this disease will turn out or how much worse it might become. But one thing I do know and that is if the current problem continues we need to find different ways to connect.\nI believe and have always believed that churches need to find ways to connect with people in a virtual way. For us that means having online services on Sunday morning and having them available on video later in the day so people can view them if they want. But there should be other ways to maintain that connection and I think we'll find out as the days continue.\nIn the meantime, for me it is not as important what we're going through now as it is where do churches go from here – what can they still have on Sunday morning that people can view online to get connected.\nAs I look at it today, the important part for us as churches is how will we meet people's needs online rather than in person? It could be about something as simple as putting video on the website or making a video available in social media for people to watch later, or, if a church is equipped to do livestreaming, we can put them up there on a regular basis and hopefully people will feel more connected as a result.\nNow in the midst of all of that, we are continuing our series based on Mark's gospel. So far Mark's gospel is a series of events; and in this series it has been in a somewhat reverse chronological order. Now he goes back to what he considered the key point of Jesus's ministry and that would be the beginning.\nLast week, Mark finished the account of Jesus being questioned by some Jews in Jerusalem because He had healed some on the Sabbath. Although we know that Jesus did a fair amount of His healing ministry on the Sabbath so as to get this message out, this incident is unique. Mark has never given any account of what happened, and he goes into a fair amount of detail of Jesus' response. In the process he makes some very important points.\nIn that incident Jesus does something that the religious leaders found extremely offensive. He was healing on the Sabbath. He healed the man with the ear. He healed him through healing the man with the sick. He was taking this most basic physical need of all and, not only taking care of it but restoring it, or even perhaps restoring him to his normal self. That's what He showed the man he needed – that his ear was healed enough to be attached once again. That's what He was doing.\nAnd so Mark tells that He healed him and he had so much compassion on him that He healed him so that he could be a witness to what God wants people to be – restored and re-connected. And he was also a witness at the same time to why this needed to be changed and that was to provide testimony to what God has done. And so Mark is telling us that Jesus did this to provide testimony about what Jesus did so they would remember in the days to come what He did about His ministry on the Sabbath.\nNow that's kind of where we are going to pick up today. In the account of that healing last week, Mark told us some of what He said – but now we're going to go deeper into what He said to them.\nI believe that in this scene what He said to them was one of the most significant things that He ever said and was one of the most significant things that He ever taught anyone. Although it has been written down by His disciples and the disciples that gathered around Him, the world at large, with the exception of a very few followers, has forgotten His teachings and He was saying such profound things that people would find difficult to understand it in a short period of time. They would have to learn and spend time together for people to get the understanding, but He still continued to teach them.\nSo in this scene we get a little insight into the mindset of the Jews at this time, which is a mindset that has never been completely removed. Jesus's response to what He said in Mark 3:4, you remember, was for them to be offended. And if He could only get them to understand it and not be offended, then they would be saved and they would understand and they would see the truth and the way things ought to be.\n\"The disciples said to Him, 'Teacher, we know that you are true and care for no one. You have no respect for the high official because you care for no one. \nIn other words, the Jewish leadership has a perception of who Jesus is. Jesus isn't just a Galilean; He's from Nazareth – Nazareth of Galilee. They say He's the product of the low end of Israel. They are very sure that Jesus is a person who is the ultimate hypocrite. The fact is the Jews knew that if they did anything on the Sabbath they could be prosecuted. That was the law. So, Jesus is a hypocrite because He is being a hypocrite; He's breaking the law, and He's doing it on the Sabbath.\nThen there is the fact that His disciples are plucking heads of grain. The fact is He is breaking the law by not letting them gather grains to satisfy their physical need. Now that is not the full story of the law of the Sabbath. For instance, the command to work on the Sabbath is for one's physical needs, and God has given us what's necessary for our needs and He has permitted it. And that's just one aspect of why they were breaking the law.\nBut that is a law that they are very sure that Christ is in violation of. The fact that Christ allowed His disciple to pluck grain and eat it shows, again, that He is in violation of the law.\nBut that's not all about the Sabbath – that's just a portion of what He said about what the Sabbath is for. He is making a much more profound point. First of all, Jesus says, \"In what way is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or bad?\" Jesus is asking because it seemed to be that the way He was doing these works was not done with their authority so that He would make a clear point about what He's teaching.\nThis is just a short bit of an explanation about how the Sabbath is for us to do good for others and not for Christ to be violating the law – for us to be obeying it. And as it turned out, He had just performed an amazing action with His disciples. First of all, if people broke the Sabbath law and were seen by others, they would be stoned without question. In the midst of breaking the Sabbath law, He allowed His disciples to pluck grain. He has just done an amazing thing. In fact, they say He is making a mockery of the Sabbath because He permits them to pluck the heads of grain, which is breaking the law.\nNow the question is: What law did they break? The answer is the law on the Sabbath concerning work. They were permitted to gather grain. But they were supposed to make sure they gathered enough grain for their physical needs for the Sabbath and they were not, from the context, plucking the heads of grain and collecting them for their physical needs – unless they were plucking that grain to be eaten.\nThe Pharisees had a good legal case that Jesus was breaking the law because, in the culture, it was very difficult at certain times to get through the day and do anything physical at all if you didn't have some food for a meal. So they said that they were only plucking the head of grain. They said that they were not going to pluck the grain until the end of the Sabbath. However, He said He would not be the judge on whether that interpretation was right, or whether it was wrong. And He said, \"Is it lawful to do good on the Sabbath?\"\nIn verse 18 when He quotes from Isaiah, He is quoting from the \"Prophets\" not from the Old Testament but from Isaiah. When he mentions the Prophets, in the original text it said \"the prophets.\" The text uses \"the prophets\" as a collective noun.\nIn the original text it uses a plural noun, \"the Law.\" The text"]], "filtered_resps": ["At first it seemed to me that we would not get any further than those who first heard Him – some of whom gave Him no more than a casual passing attention before they turned sharply away in disgust.
