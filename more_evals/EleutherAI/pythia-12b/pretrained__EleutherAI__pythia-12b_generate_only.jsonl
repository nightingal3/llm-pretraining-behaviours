        "A wide variety of industrial robots are used in the assembly of motor vehicles, in the production of aircraft, and in many other manufacturing operations to perform both precise and repetitive tasks. In a relatively small fraction of the robots, the precise, complex motions of a plurality of movable members, such as fingers or other manipulative tools or fixtures, are controlled and coordinated in order to accomplish particular manufacturing tasks. Typically, the movable members are articulated or otherwise coupled to a fixed member to which motions are imparted, usually by one or more motor operated actuation systems. Such robots must be capable of a variety of motions, such as rotating, back and forth reciprocating, and oscillating motions, each under control of associated control systems. Because of the precision requirements often associated with such types of robots, the control systems have typically relied on a combination of feedback information to sense the actual position and motion of the members with respect to a command or program signal and then to generate command signals in accordance with the command or program signal to control the actuators for movement of the members.\nThe foregoing approach to robotics is not only quite complex, but costly as well. As one can ascertain, there are many factors that combine to affect the cost. In a system having a large number of movable members, complexity not only includes the complexity of controlling all of the associated actuators, but the complexity of the associated feedback instrumentation. In a system having a large number of actuators or manipulators, complexity includes not only the complexity of all related feedback instrumentation, but also the complexity of the associated servomotors and other control elements that are required to position and control the manipulators. Moreover, as those skilled in the art will recognize, increased complexity also results from the use of numerous parts to couple the actuators, servomotors, and other control elements to form the appropriate feedback loops, in addition to the associated interfacing of the various instrumentation and the programming of the associated electronic control elements.\nA further disadvantage associated with conventional robotics relates specifically to the use of servomotors. Servomotors typically include a motor for imparting motion to the servomotor itself, and a reduction gearing assembly arranged to provide motion to the attached movable member. The reduction gearing assembly usually comprises a large diameter, low torque output gearing element arranged to be driven by the motor through the utilization of a drive belt. As can be appreciated, the weight and bulk of the motor is a direct result of the high torque of the motor required, and, in turn, the gearing assembly for transmitting these high torques to the movable member.\nAnother important disadvantage results due to the fixed physical relationship between the servomotor and its associated movable member. With servomotors of relatively long length, inasmuch as the servomotor is usually mounted at one end of the movable member, a rather massive and clumsy support structure for the servomotor is generally needed to maintain alignment during movement of the servomotor and the attached movable member.\nWith the foregoing in mind, there presently exists a need for a highly versatile, economical and efficient mechanism to couple together a pair of elements to effect motion of the elements in any direction, and an accompanying need for a compact, lightweight, low power and low cost mechanism for supporting and connecting these elements."

        "The present invention relates generally to the field of software development, and more specifically to application frameworks for web services.\nOne of the primary goals of most websites is to provide information to people. Web services is one technique for providing this information. Web services facilitate the exchange of data in a platform-independent manner between heterogeneous computing systems. While a number of programming languages and environments permit the creation, publishing, and invocation of web services, the creation of a complex web application involves the development of a large number of web services that often are developed independently from one another.\nMoreover, most web service platforms lack the capabilities to automatically create, deploy, and integrate a set of web services that satisfy various business, organizational, contractual, and other business goals. This can be problematic since, before the web services are actually deployed, a large pool of resources will have already been invested in their development. In addition, an organization may have a number of business, organizational, contractual, and other business goals that are not known at the outset.\nConventionally, each web service is implemented individually, using programming languages or environments that may be very different from one another and that may be very different from the programming languages or environments for which a user desires a web service. Web services may also be defined using web standards provided by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). The problem with this is that an organization may have a number of web services that are defined using different standards. Often, organizations that provide a web service may prefer that only certain users have access to that service. Therefore, it would be inefficient to allow any and all users of the web service access to it.\nAn additional drawback with conventional systems may be that web service interfaces may evolve, causing web services to become incompatible upon the deployment of an updated service interface. This incompatibility would have to be manually compensated for by providing applications that manually integrate the service interface of one web service with the service interface of another web service.\nFurthermore, conventionally, the execution of a set of web services involves manual generation of web services interface definitions that can integrate the various web services. Thus, even the invocation of a set of web services, which has to date conventionally involved many separate operations, still requires manual intervention to execute. The manual implementation of the integration of these operations can cause issues with manual error detection, time-consuming and expensive error detection during execution, and execution failure due to any of the manual operations during processing being incomplete or incorrectly implemented.\nAs such, what is desired is a web services framework that addresses deficiencies of conventional approaches."
