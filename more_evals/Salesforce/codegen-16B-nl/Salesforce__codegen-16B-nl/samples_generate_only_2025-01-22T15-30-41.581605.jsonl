As a condenser microphone unit for this purpose, an integrated type condenser microphone unit formed by combining and integrating a diaphragm, a spacer and a fixed capacitor is known.\nIt is a common practice that, in an integrated type condenser microphone unit, a high frequency signal which is obtained by high-pass-filtering an output signal of the condenser microphone unit at a certain frequency is used as a signal to control a driving pulse width of a push-pull type speaker and thus improve the sound pressure characteristic.\nFIG. 15 shows a conventional digital microphone system 500 comprising an electric circuit section 501 and an electret condenser microphone unit 502.\nAs shown in FIG. 15, the electric circuit section 501 comprises a high-pass filter circuit 516 comprising passive parts having resistor R1 and capacitor C1 and a capacitor C2, outputting a high frequency signal to a comparator 518. The voltage of capacitor C2 is compared by the comparator 518 with a reference voltage Vref to control timing at which the output of comparator 518 changes and thus generate control pulse Cp for controlling a push-pull type speaker. This pulse Cp is amplified by an amplifier 515 and then applied to a push-pull type speaker 513 of the electret condenser microphone unit 502.\nThe digital microphone system 500 is such that an output signal obtained by the electret condenser microphone unit 502 is A/D converted by an A/D converter 514 and thus a digital signal is obtained. The digital signal is subjected to various digital processes by a digital unit 503. Digital microphone system 500 as mentioned above is disclosed in, for example, Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application No. 62-185853 (e.g., page 2, FIG. 1).\nFIG. 16 shows a block diagram of a conventional voice recognition system 601.\nThe voice recognition system 601 comprises an electret condenser microphone unit 602, an amplitude detecting/high-pass-filtering section 604, a waveform segmenting section 606 and a feature amount extracting section 608. The voice input into the voice recognition system 601 is converted to a digital signal by the electret condenser microphone unit 602 and thus a digital signal D1 is obtained.\nA voice signal is input into the amplitude detecting/high-pass-filtering section 604. A high frequency signal component is thus extracted and then is amplified by amplifier 605 and high-pass-filtered. The output of amplifier 605 is compared with a reference voltage Vref in an amplifier 612 by an amplifier 609. Amplifier 609 changes a timing at which an output thereof changes in response to a frequency of a high frequency signal input via a capacitor 607. The output of amplifier 609 is also input into the waveform segmenting section 606. The amplitudes of the output of amplifier 609 at timing at which the output changes are waveform segmented by the waveform segmenting section 606. A feature amount signal D2 being a representative signal of an input speech voice is obtained by executing predetermined processes such as calculation processing and integration processing on each amplitude of the divided pieces of waveform.\nFeature amount signal D2 is input into the feature amount extracting section 608. The feature amount signal D2 is input into a data comparison unit 614 connected to the outside whereby it is compared with a feature amount of an input voice signal on the outside. The compared result is compared by a data judgement unit 612 with a feature amount which has been recognized as a speech voice (hereinbelow, simply \"recognized feature amount\") beforehand and if they are coincident, it is judged that a voice which is input into the voice recognition system 601 is the input voice signal and the result of judgment is output as \"voice\" from a judgement unit 613.\nThe voice recognition system 601 is disclosed in, for example, Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application No. 7-294470 (e.g., FIG. 5).\nAs is described above, in the digital microphone system 500, the output of the electret condenser microphone unit 502 is A/D converted and thus a digital signal D1 is obtained. Digital signal D1 is then subject to various digital processes (e.g., filtering and voice recognition). It is, therefore, desirable that a noise component is not included in the digital signal D1 obtained in this case and noise is as little as possible in order to obtain a digital signal D1 which is as much as possible as a digital signal D1 for digital processing of a speech signal.\nIt is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide a method or system for generating an analog signal from a digital signal with reduced noise, a digital-to-analog converter (D/A converter) according to the present invention, a D/A converter circuit of the present invention and a D/A converter for converting to an analog signal in order to obtain a digital signal D1 with reduced noise."], "filter": "none", "metrics": ["bypass"], "doc_hash": "45e3c16e2afcebba5bad6d617efcfd4260f74a2bcf0312b9bf9fa032f8dc294a", "prompt_hash": "3d0c1cf596181258a003e9f95c836c765d44353532e67c70d7dff48b05f64840", "target_hash": "e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855", "bypass": null}

An acoustic digitalization is a typical example, and there are increasing needs for various types of acoustic equipment such as a CD multi-media player, an electronic still camera and an equalizer.\nAn electret condenser microphone (ECM) is widely used as a microphone for general speech sound in which dynamic properties of speech sound are relatively important. As the performance of equipment in which the electret condenser microphone unit is built-in is increasingly required, various types of electret condenser microphones have been developed so far.\nFor example, in a digital microphone system for converting a voice signal to an electric signal and then storing it in a magnetic disk unit or the like, a condenser microphone unit is required to have a sound pressure characteristic which has an S/N ratio as high as 50dB or thereabouts in which distortion is minimized and the peak level is not remarkably high.

The voltage of capacitor C2 is compared by the comparator 518 with a reference voltage Vref to control timing at which the output of comparator 518 changes and thus generate control pulse Cp for controlling a push-pull type speaker.

An acoustic digitalization is a typical example, and there are increasing needs for various types of acoustic equipment such as a CD multi-media player, an electronic still camera and an equalizer.\nAn electret condenser microphone (ECM) is widely used as a microphone for general speech sound in which dynamic properties of speech sound are relatively important. As the performance of equipment in which the electret condenser microphone unit is built-in is increasingly required, various types of electret condenser microphones have been developed so far.\nFor example, in a digital microphone system for converting a voice signal to an electric signal and then storing it in a magnetic disk unit or the like, a condenser microphone unit is required to have a sound pressure characteristic which has an S/N ratio as high as 50dB or thereabouts in which distortion is minimized and the peak level is not remarkably high. As a condenser microphone unit for this purpose, an integrated type condenser microphone unit formed by combining and integrating a diaphragm, a spacer and a fixed capacitor is known.\nIt is a common practice that, in an integrated type condenser microphone unit, a high frequency signal which is obtained by high-pass-filtering an output signal of the condenser microphone unit at a certain frequency is used as a signal to control a driving pulse width of a push-pull type speaker and thus improve the sound pressure characteristic.\nFIG. 15 shows a conventional digital microphone system 500 comprising an electric circuit section 501 and an electret condenser microphone unit 502.\nAs shown in FIG. 15, the electric circuit section 501 comprises a high-pass filter circuit 516 comprising passive parts having resistor R1 and capacitor C1 and a capacitor C2, outputting a high frequency signal to a comparator 518. The voltage of capacitor C2 is compared by the comparator 518 with a reference voltage Vref to control timing at which the output of comparator 518 changes and thus generate control pulse Cp for controlling a push-pull type speaker.

The feature amount signal D2 is input into a data comparison unit 614 connected to the outside whereby it is compared with a feature amount of an input voice signal on the outside. The compared result is compared by a data judgement unit 612 with a feature amount which has been recognized as a speech voice (hereinbelow, simply \"recognized feature amount\") beforehand and if they are coincident, it is judged that a voice which is input into the voice recognition system 601 is the input voice signal and the result of judgment is output as \"voice\" from a judgement unit 613.\nThe voice recognition system 601 is disclosed in, for example, Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application No. 7-294470 (e.g., FIG. 5).\nAs is described above, in the digital microphone system 500, the output of the electret condenser microphone unit 502 is A/D converted and thus a digital signal D1 is obtained.

An acoustic digitalization is a typical example, and there are increasing needs for various types of acoustic equipment such as a CD multi-media player, an electronic still camera and an equalizer.\nAn electret condenser microphone (ECM) is widely used as a microphone for general speech sound in which dynamic properties of speech sound are relatively important. As the performance of equipment in which the electret condenser microphone unit is built-in is increasingly required, various types of electret condenser microphones have been developed so far.\nFor example, in a digital microphone system for converting a voice signal to an electric signal and then storing it in a magnetic disk unit or the like, a condenser microphone unit is required to have a sound pressure characteristic which has an S/N ratio as high as 50dB or thereabouts in which distortion is minimized and the peak level is not remarkably high. As a condenser microphone unit for this purpose, an integrated type condenser microphone unit formed by combining and integrating a diaphragm, a spacer and a fixed capacitor is known.\nIt is a common practice that, in an integrated type condenser microphone unit, a high frequency signal which is obtained by high-pass-filtering an output signal of the condenser microphone unit at a certain frequency is used as a signal to control a driving pulse width of a push-pull type speaker and thus improve the sound pressure characteristic.\nFIG. 15 shows a conventional digital microphone system 500 comprising an electric circuit section 501 and an electret condenser microphone unit 502.\nAs shown in FIG. 15, the electric circuit section 501 comprises a high-pass filter circuit 516 comprising passive parts having resistor R1 and capacitor C1 and a capacitor C2, outputting a high frequency signal to a comparator 518. The voltage of capacitor C2 is compared by the comparator 518 with a reference voltage Vref to control timing at which the output of comparator 518 changes and thus generate control pulse Cp for controlling a push-pull type speaker. This pulse Cp is amplified by an amplifier 515 and then applied to a push-pull type speaker 513 of the electret condenser microphone unit 502.\nThe digital microphone system 500 is such that an output signal obtained by the electret condenser microphone unit 502 is A/D converted by an A/D converter 514 and thus a digital signal is obtained. The digital signal is subjected to various digital processes by a digital unit 503. Digital microphone system 500 as mentioned above is disclosed in, for example, Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application No. 62-185853 (e.g., page 2, FIG. 1).\nFIG. 16 shows a block diagram of a conventional voice recognition system 601.\nThe voice recognition system 601 comprises an electret condenser microphone unit 602, an amplitude detecting/high-pass-filtering section 604, a waveform segmenting section 606 and a feature amount extracting section 608. The voice input into the voice recognition system 601 is converted to a digital signal by the electret condenser microphone unit 602 and thus a digital signal D1 is obtained.\nA voice signal is input into the amplitude detecting/high-pass-filtering section 604. A high frequency signal component is thus extracted and then is amplified by amplifier 605 and high-pass-filtered. The output of amplifier 605 is compared with a reference voltage Vref in an amplifier 612 by an amplifier 609. Amplifier 609 changes a timing at which an output thereof changes in response to a frequency of a high frequency signal input via a capacitor 607. The output of amplifier 609 is also input into the waveform segmenting section 606. The amplitudes of the output of amplifier 609 at timing at which the output changes are waveform segmented by the waveform segmenting section 606. A feature amount signal D2 being a representative signal of an input speech voice is obtained by executing predetermined processes such as calculation processing and integration processing on each amplitude of the divided pieces of waveform.\nFeature amount signal D2 is input into the feature amount extracting section 608. The feature amount signal D2 is input into a data comparison unit 614 connected to the outside whereby it is compared with a feature amount of an input voice signal on the outside. The compared result is compared by a data judgement unit 612 with a feature amount which has been recognized as a speech voice (hereinbelow, simply \"recognized feature amount\") beforehand and if they are coincident, it is judged that a voice which is input into the voice recognition system 601 is the input voice signal and the result of judgment is output as \"voice\" from a judgement unit 613.\nThe voice recognition system 601 is disclosed in, for example, Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application No. 7-294470 (e.g., FIG. 5).\nAs is described above, in the digital microphone system 500, the output of the electret condenser microphone unit 502 is A/D converted and thus a digital signal D1 is obtained.

It is, therefore, desirable that a noise component is not included in the digital signal D1 obtained in this case and noise is as little as possible in order to obtain a digital signal D1 which is as much as possible as a digital signal D1 for digital processing of a speech signal.\nIt is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide a method or system for generating an analog signal from a digital signal with reduced noise, a digital-to-analog converter (D/A converter) according to the present invention, a D/A converter circuit of the present invention and a D/A converter for converting to an analog signal in order to obtain a digital signal D1 with reduced noise."], "filter": "none", "metrics": ["bypass"], "doc_hash": "45e3c16e2afcebba5bad6d617efcfd4260f74a2bcf0312b9bf9fa032f8dc294a", "prompt_hash": "3d0c1cf596181258a003e9f95c836c765d44353532e67c70d7dff48b05f64840", "target_hash": "e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855", "bypass": null}
